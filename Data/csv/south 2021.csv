Abstract 
 
Companies are confirming that in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world, it is possible to gather 
improvements from becoming demand driven. To achieve this, it is important for organizations to be aware of the 
Supply Chains present on its operations to apply different segmentation approaches in managing them. We analyzed 
several segmentation models in order to adapt one of them to identify a Demand Driven Supply Chain (DDSC) in a 
company object of study. The objective was to quantify the percentage of produced volume which has DDSC 
characteristics, based on the buying behavior of two previously identified customers group. The proposed model 
enabled the organization to identify that 47,94% of group A volume and 85,07% of group B volume were adherent to 
a DDSC. By using gathered data from a real application, the model strongly supports the use of a quantitative fuzzy 
methodology to segment supply chains, since the results were coherent to the reality pointed by the experts from the 
studied industry. The adapted model contributed to the alignment of the Supply Chain of the studied industry, 
providing a more accurate evaluation methodology than other proposed models in literature, facilitating the indication 
of strategic paths to realignment.

1. Introduction 
Satisfying customer is companies’ main purpose. In order to achieve this goal, they must perfectly manage their flows 
and deliver their products on time (Miclo et al. 2015). Most of modern approaches rely on only one strategy to attend 
all the clients; however, enterprises that recognize the differences between clients and then align the value delivery 
strategy according to these differences have a superior performance (Gattorna, 2006). Differing customer requirements 
– and the fact that Supply Chain Management (SCM) is applied as a means of differentiation from competitors – led 
to the perception that a one-size-fits-all approach to SCM seems to be inadequate (Christopher et al. 2006). According 
to Mayer et al. (2009), organizations that apply different segmentation approaches in manage their Supply Chains are 
more successful than their pairs that uses the one-size-fits-all approach. 
 
Companies deal with distinct groups of clients, with requisites that differentiate them among each other, in order to 
improve their treatment, it is important to develop supply chain strategies that are specific for each group (Christopher 
2000). The success or failure of supply chains are going to be determined in the market by the end customers. Make 
the right product, at the right price on the right time gets to the customer is no longer a competitive success factor, but 
also a survival one (Mason-Jones et al. 2000). In the present manufacturing scenario, agility is an important factor for 
industries to compete in the markets (Grantham et al. 2007).  
 
Agility on Supply Chain Management relies on responsivity. Conventional supply chains are long, with great lead-
times and tend to be forecast-driven. On the other hand, agile supply chains are short and then to be demand driven 
(Cristopher et al. 2004). The Demand Driven Supply Chain (DDSC) is a system of technologies and processes that 
senses and respond to demand in real-time across the network of customers, suppliers and employees (Barrett and 
Barger Jr. 2010). As stated by Stabilini and Belvedere (2014), in order to become more competitive, companies need

193","Another strategy is the adoption of the Demand Driven Material Requirement Planning (DDMRP), which, according 
to Kortabarria et al. (2019) was developed as an answer to the volatile markets. Miclo et al. (2019) pointed that 
DDMRP is only one part of a broader approach of the Demand Driven Adaptive Enterprise (DDAE) to improve 
planning, schedule and overall management is this new reality of volatile markets. Identifying a DDSC enables the 
company to be more certain of their real positioning among their clients and give them an indication of which tools 
and strategies to implement in order to take competitive advantage from its reality. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This work main proposal was to adapt a supply chain segmentation model to assess the identification of DDSCs in 
industries. It is important to develop new approaches to enable companies to better positioning themselves and to 
guide them into finding new methods and tools to thrive in this more turbulent and dynamic markets. This study 
illustrates the adaptation and application of a fuzzy methodology to identify a DDSC in a fertilizer mixing industry. 
Aligned with the main objective, the proposed model was able to evaluate the current patterns in the clients and 
company behavior from a quantitative set of data. According to the data obtained from the model application, 47,94% 
of the demand from Group A and 85,07% of the demand from Group B were adherent to a DDSC.  
 
There are many segmentation models, but none of them seeks to identify the Demand Driven environment. This work 
adapted a model that, according to Ferreira (2017), united two strong and different schools in supply chain 
segmentation (the lean-agile and the dynamic alignment schools), in order to accomplish the objective of identify the 
DDSC. The results confirmed the initial affirmation of two distinct customer segments, deepening the understanding 
that, besides clients, the supply chains were significantly different. Another objective of the work was to propose 
strategies for the company to align their operations with the supply chain. As previously shown, the model proposed 
by Ptak and Smith (2018) called DDAE might be a solution for the company to adapt their strategy to the DDSC 
identified in the study.  
 
Despite the results, we recognize that our study is not a definitive model for quantitatively segmenting supply chains. 
It is needed further research and exploration in order to accomplish important and necessary advancements. As 
proposed future research, we suggest (1) a better characterization of the DDSC; (2) tests with another segmentation 
models in order to seek a faster result and (3) the creation of methods to remove the human judgment in the creation 
of the parameters for the membership functions, such as Neurofuzzy techniques, making the segmentation happen in 
real time.

Abstract 
 
Business benefits can be generated from analyzing large amounts of information in real time, reflecting on an 
efficient way of managing processes. Although not is a reality for most companies, the concepts of Industry 4.0 
are already being characterized as a trend for the future. In this way, the purpose of this study was to optimize the 
delivery time of cylinders for rotogravure print shop process, through the technologies of Industry 4.0. The study 
was focused on the impacts and the benefits that Industry 4.0 can add to the process. As a method, an observational 
study was carried out to identify the process reality. After, was developed an adaptation proposal with modeling 
and simulation for the cylinder management process, based on Industry 4.0 technologies. Was considered only a 
process in order to not generate complex simulations. The proposed model optimizes resources, bringing 
satisfactory and immediate results, as well as providing the implantation of this new technology in a gradual way, 
for the other process steps.

1. Introduction  
 
The constant technological transformation has been changing the competition rules, making that the organizations 
to take a new look at their processes (Dalenogare et al. 2018). Davis et al. (2015) highlight the change in customer 
positioning in the last 10 years, the search for customized products and rapid response to market demands has 
accelerated global competitiveness. In this way, the use of advanced technologies become fundamental in the 
restructuring of processes (Davis et al. 2015). To invest in a construction of dynamic and autonomous systems 
capable of remodel processes, and in technologies such as Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical 
System (CPS) (Bär et al. 2018; Davis et al. 2015), among others, is justified by the storage and exchange of data 
between these systems along the value chain (Brettel et al. 2014). 
 
Regarded as the fourth industrial revolution, the Industry 4.0, the term originated in Germany, aims to build 
intelligent products and processes, integrating physical objects with information and communication technologies 
(TIC) (Brettel et al. 2014; Ciffolilli and Muscio 2018; Dalenogare et al. 2018). The proposal of Industry 4.0 is 
through connectivity to have more flexible processes and allow the analysis of a large amount of data in real time, 
creating a series of benefits for industry (Dalenogare et al. 2018). Having noted the importance of technological 
advancement within manufacturing processes, the three largest producing countries in Europe have launched 
programs aimed at the development of Industry 4.0, namely: Germany with the programs “High-Tech Strategy 
2020”,  France with the program “Industrie du Futur” and Italy with the program “Piano Nazionale Indústria 4.0” 
(Ciffolilli and Muscio 2018; Dalenogare et al. 2018). These programs are aimed at improving processes that 
benefit the entire value chain, aiming to create a flexible production environment by managing the physical world 
in a virtual way, adding value to the product/service while maintaining high quality and reducing costs (Ciffolilli 
and Muscio 2018). However, for this to happen there is a need for prior knowledge of the processes by the 
organization.

205",,"comprehensively and not only on a specific activity. In addition, the simulation has helped significantly in 
determining which are the key processes to initiate the implementation of the technologies of the industry 4.0 and 
consequently in the transformation of the industrial chain. This study points out the mapping of integrated 
processes to simulation as an essential tool to initiate the analyzes of the digital transformation of the industries. 
In this way, the proposed method of process mapping and simulation can help the industries in identifying the 
priority processes to start the implementation of the Industry 4.0. Since the improvement of critical processes is 
pointed out with great potential for increases in productivity and efficiency in the industry, the use of intelligent 
manufacturing technologies should be directed towards these processes in order to maximize the benefits. 
  
5.1. Considerations for future work 
 
In order to continue the gradual transformation of the process to Industry 4.0, it is suggested that, after the 
application of the presented suggestion, a new mapping and simulation of the print shop process. In this way, it is 
possible to continue identifying new bottlenecks in other stages of the process and to apply new technologies, 
leading to the progressive change towards digital transformation. Another suggestion is to carry out the same 
analysis done in the process based on costs and benefits, to then determine if it is in keeping with the current 
reality of the costs of the technologies.

Abstract 
 
The research aimed to carry out a scientific mapping, in Scopus and Science Direct, about project 
management and educational perspectives for industry 4.0. For this was used the method Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We conduced a systematic 
literature review on the topics Industry 4.0, project management, skills and engineering education. From 
the results found, it is highlighted that the project management theme will be very important in view of the 
new industrial revolution being considered a professional, methodological and operational competence. 
Authors highlight the importance of the theme for the information technology (IT) sectors facing the 
transformations caused by the fourth industrial revolution. However, in the area of education, there is a 
paradigm regarding the project management discipline as it is neglected in engineering courses, not 
arousing student interest. To minimize this problem, a partnership between governments, universities and 
companies is mentioned. Another possible solution to reduce this educational gap is the creation of Learning 
Factories, which enable the union between theory and practice, arousing greater interest of students and 
assisting in the development of skills required by industry 4.0.

1. Introduction 
 
Projects bring development through the renewal of products and services, changing paradigms and 
generating sustainability for organizations (Almeida and Neto, 2015). Although, Koke and Moehler (2019) 
and Silvius (2017) mention that there are still challenges regarding the union between projects and 
sustainability. San Cristobál (2017) comment that over the years the projects have become increasingly 
complex. This complexity influences directly the modeling, evaluation and control, affecting time, cost, 
quality and safety.  
 
The changes are directly linked to projects, and these are linked to the technical and behavioral skills that 
help in decision making. Balve and Ebert (2019) comment that project management is an area in which 
academics work only after completing a course. Radujkovic and Sjekavica (2017) claim that project 
management is inevitable in the current scenario, becoming a required subject in undergraduate (Raoufi et 
al. 2018). Vila et al. (2017) are concerned with how Project Management has been neglected in engineering 
courses. Kohdeir (2018) reports that project management at universities faces difficulties since the 
discipline does not answer the needs required by the industries and also why does not arouse interest of 
students  
 
Thus, this research aims to carry out a scientific mapping on project management and educational 
perspectives for industry 4.0. Finding possible gaps and opportunities in project management was also the 
focus of this research. The development this study was divided into 5 sections, and the first one was 
presented. Section 2 we describe the theoretical foundation for the better understanding of industry 4.0, 
project management, skills and engineering education. Section 3 comprises the research methodology. 
Subsequently the sections 4 and 5 are composed respectively by, results and conclusion.

Abstract  
 
The change in the use of natural resources on our planet is a most urgent topic to be addressed in the environmental 
agendas of all governments and discussed by civil society and the academic community. As consequence of this period 
known as Anthropocene, global warming is one of the most critical issues on the environmental agenda in the 21st 
century as it affects biogeochemical cycles and planetary biodiversity. In terms of sustainability, higher education can 
introduce new trends in the domains of education, research, and extension. However, understanding the Environmental 
Agenda requires a more careful analysis of information, stakeholder dynamics, public management and conflict of 
interest. How to counter desinformation about environmental education in HEIs (Higher Education Institutions)? This 
qualitative research based on the Federal Network of Professional Scientific and Technological Teaching (RFEPCT) 
seeks, through the proposal of a digital platform, to present a means of greening education.

1. Introduction  
 
On the premise that 'a society based on a growth economy is not desirable, not sustainable, not viable, not durable', 
since we are already consuming more than the planet can offer us and it took billions of years to build. By nature, 
today emerges an environmental ethic that proposes the revaluation of life and the human being.

It is noteworthy that the consolidation of information in a digital platform is only enlightening, in order to provide 
""the first steps"", and not exhaustive, about environmental information to researchers. The integration of international 
networks and organizations aims to facilitate contact from different sources from a common origin. However, it 
recognizes that it should have its basis compared to other forms of research for continuous enrichment of this work. 
 
6. Conclusions  
As consequence of this recently called Anthropocene period, climate change is one of the most significant axes of the 
environmental agenda in the 21st century, as it affects biogeochemical cycles and planetary biodiversity. However, it 
should not be forgotten that we are embedded in a consumer society that promotes, encourages or reinforces the choice 
of a consumerist lifestyle and existential strategy, and rejects all alternative cultural options. 
Questioning the growth society implies questioning capitalism, the current planetary crisis elicits different responses 
in individuals, groups and governments, ranging from denial, misunderstanding and indifference to a yearning for 
engagement and activism. At first glance, it seems impossible to build 'sustainable development' without an education 
for greening. Regarding the educational, scientific and academic field, this context requires commitment to the search 
for technical and political-economic solutions that meet the material and symbolic needs that structure contemporary 
society, without ignoring the conflicts of interest in this and its contradictions. 
The relationship between environment and citizenship education takes on an increasingly challenging role, demanding 
the emergence of new knowledge to grasp social processes that are becoming more complex every day. At this point, 
there needs to be an educational process capable of positioning itself politically and conducting a critical analysis of 
the various social and environmental projects that dispute social and political-pedagogical goals.

233","As an informational artifact for the integration and interaction of these relations, being one of the contributions of this 
thesis, a pilot project was elaborated through the creation of a digital platform that, besides bringing the main concepts 
raised by the research, offers a series of other resources (such as for example, films, lectures, debates and research 
projects) that can be shared among researchers on ecological issues, their collaborating partners, including any citizen 
interested in researching the topic. 
Through the organization of the digital platform, the objective is to clarify the concept of Disinformation, Information 
Regime and, above all, to offer material for other research, discussion groups and work that develop projects focused 
on Education in the Anthropocene, which may benefit from the CTS (Science-Technology-Society) approach to foster 
the dissemination of a culture focused on institutional environmental sustainability, since CTSA (Science-
Technology-Society-Environment) education proposes new references of knowledge and practices integrating 
technology with content, promoting the awareness of the student so that one builds a new awareness about the 
environmental impacts.

Abstract 
In this study a financial analysis of a small scale gold producing and selling company was done 
to determine the liquidity of the organization. The gearing ratio was found to be as high as 44.5% 
with a company equity of $412 000. The debtor’s collection period was 34.7 days with debtor’s 
turnover ratio of 5.73. The creditor’s turnover ratio was 1.67 with an inventory turnover of 0.83 
and a net profit margin of 6.3% was realized. The analysis indicated that the organization’s 
liquidity was depressed.  
Keywords: Debtors, creditors, gearing, inventory, profit margin 
1. Introduction 
The process of Financial Analysis involves identifying the financial weaknesses and strengths of an 
organization by thoroughly analyzing the financial statement (Ghergina, 2009). An organization’s 
financial statement shows the financial data in an organized manner and is used to measure the financial 
position of an organization.  
A registered company small scale gold mining company incorporated under Companies Act Chapter 
24:03 in Zimbabwe. Its sole business is to mine and sell gold under small scale operations. The Managing 
Director of the company received the summarized Statements of Comprehensive Income and Financial 
Position from his Accountant as indicated in Annexure 1. The Managing Director was very much pleased 
with the results especially the huge profits before tax of $45 200-00. He however told his Accountant that 
he could not understand why the company has been struggling to pay its operational expenses during the 
course of the year and was also worried about the negative bank balance. There was then need to 
undertake the financial analysis of the organization so as to map the way forward for the organization.

Abstract 
 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are not particularly popular 
disciplines among University applicants. In addition, there is high rate of dropouts in the first years 
of these programs. Since motivation is a very important factor in the selection of a University 
program as well as in students´ success or failure, we have included the National University of 
Hurlingham to the Relevance of Science Education (ROSE) project. In order to know more about 
students´ attitudes, a survey was carried out among 359 high school students in Argentina. A four-
point Likert scale was used to analyze answers on the basis of the Principal Component Analysis 
(PCM). Four profile related components were obtained: 
• C1. Topics in the sections: “what I would like to learn”. 109 context-related topics in 
Natural Sciences (environmental protection, common affairs, natural phenomena, health, 
mysteries, CTS, NOS, etc.). Of these, this profile includes aspects related to health and 
reproduction, in particular sexual health, sex, growth and maturation and diseases. 
• C2. Aspects the sections: “What I would like to learn” related with technology (functions 
of technological objects, substances such as petroleum, explosives). Items from the section 
“My future work” appear less often (such as work with machines, tools or technology, 
creation or repair of technological objects). 
• C3. Topics related with “What I would like to learn” mostly appear in two subject groups: 
mysteries, outer space objects and extraterrestrial life on the one hand; and on the other 
recent inventions and discoveries. Protection of endangered species is also mentioned. 
• C4. In the section “My experiences outside school”, the following are mentioned: use of 
levers, wheelbarrows and binoculars, garbage separation and tire repair.

Abstract 
 
In the subject Probability and Statistics for Engineering careers at National University of La 
Matanza, Argentina, a high number of dropouts and disapprovals are observed. Taking this into 
account, the professors of this subject started some years ago to use an automatic self-correcting 
web platform called e-status. This platform has the free software R as a calculation engine and 
allows parameterizing problems so that students can solve it several times, with variations. The 
students have an active repository of problems to practice the contents proposed by their teachers, 
obtaining immediate correction of their results. Although the results obtained in previous 
publications of this research group show a clear incidence of the practice in e-status on the approval 
of the subject, it was observed the need to accompany the numerical exercises with others of 
conceptual or theoretical type to favor reflection and metacognition of the contents. Students 
require more guidance for learning in e- learning spaces that favor the questioning of their 
conceptual assumptions and their way of appropriating the contents. To take these aspects into 
account, we worked on the contents of the platform and offered students a course in metacognitive 
strategies. The monitoring carried out from 2016 to 2018 shows a statistically significant academic 
improvement in favor of those who use the platform. Additionally, the increase in the use of the 
platform is an indicator of the value given by students and teachers to it, with a positive effect on 
the approval of the subject and consequently on the decrease in dropouts.

Abstract  
 
This study emphasized on the famous factors (activity, structure and intensity) responsible for energy consumed in 
the South African Construction and Building industry between 1994 and 2016. A famous technique in the 
understanding of such factors was employed – Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI). Structure effect was 
inconsequential on its impact on the change in energy consumption. Intensity on the other hand played its role to 
affecting the energy consumption positively but could not overturn the increase experienced during the period of 
study. Activity effect was the major contributor to the 88.7% increase in the energy consumed. Improvement on energy 
efficiency within this industry requires not just investment on new technologies but improvement on existing 
technologies will improve the various activities/operations needed within the industry. 
Keywords  
Construction and Building industry, LMDI, energy consumption, energy efficiency. 
 
1. Introduction  
 
Building and construction industry has been reported to be among the largest carbon emitters in the world (Wang et al., 
2018). 25% of the world’s carbon emissions is contributed by building’s energy use (Monahan and Powell, 2011). Apart 
from the contributions of building and construction industry as well as building’s energy use to the global carbon 
emissions, the cement sector contributes additional 5% of the global carbon emissions (Worrell et al., 2001). Year 2014 
reported the cement industry consuming 7% of industrial energy consumption globally (Kermeli et al., 2019). With the 
high level of process emissions during cement production, the industry is positioned second to the iron and steel industry 
in the emission category reporting 6% of global carbon dioxide emissions (International Energy Agency (IEA)., 2017). 
The management of carbon emissions has put increased pressure on the building and construction industry (Li et al., 
2017)(Wu, Xia and Wang, 2015).  Cement production is associated to construction activity, in other words linked to 
building and construction and civil engineering and construction industries. 
These emissions encountered by the building and construction are due to the industry’s energy intensive nature (Wu et 
al., 2019). To successfully manage the industry’s carbon emission, analysis of previous trend of energy use becomes 
significant. This study focusses on evaluating the energy use from South Africa’s construction between 1994 and 2016 
by identifying those influencing factors, which can lead to effective policy making. 
The increasing concern surrounding energy savings and emission reduction issues has led various studies to explore 
and quantify the factors responsible for those changes (Wang and Feng, 2018b). Such studies adopt decomposition 
techniques to understand such changes. The famous decomposition techniques are the structural decomposition analysis 
(SDA) and the index decomposition analysis (IDA). Both techniques are unique in their own way. The theory behind 
SDA was thoroughly reviewed by Rose and Casler (Rose and Casler, 1996). SDA’s functionality is dependent on an 
input-output tables which limits its use as these tables are not readily available (Mi et al., 2017). IDA’s functionality on 
the other hand is dependent on the concept of index number (Hoekstra and Van den Bergh, 2003). Due to minimum 
data requirements, IDA is preferred by most researchers to SDA (Lin and Liu, 2015). From the revisions of various 
IDA methods, Ang (2004) concluded with Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) as the preferred choice given its 
simplicity when it comes to usage and interpretation of result as well as its theoretical foundation.

249","5. Conclusion 
 
In this study, factors responsible for the increase in South Africa’s energy consumption at the building construction and 
civil engineering and the construction industrial sectors was analysed between 1994 and 2016. These factors include 
activity, structure and intensity. Analysis was carried out using the additive LMDI. It can be concluded that (1) activity 
was the most responsible factor leading to 88.7% increase of energy from 1994 to 2016. Most of the activities involved 
in the industry are the extraction, processing and manufacture, transportation and assembly. Production of a concrete 
would require approximately 2.775 MJ of energy. The amount of energy is a lot especially with the number of concretes 
to be manufactured by these industries in the promotion of economic growth. (2) Intensity had a positive effect on the 
energy consumption through its reduction proving efficient use of energy though not sufficient enough to reduce the 
total consumption of energy. (3) Structure effect was unrecognizable in its impact made towards the increase of energy 
consumption during the period of study. 
To improve on the energy efficiency as it concerns the various activities, not just investment on new technologies are 
important but an improvement of existing technologies would go a long way. This will lead to an improvement in the 
operational efficiency and optimization of the allocation of resources (in this case – energy) as it is required for the 
industry processes.

1. Introduction 
 
Industry 4.0 is a transformation supported by technological advances in which sensors, machines, workpieces and IT 
systems will be connected along the value chain beyond a single company (RüBmann, 2015). Given the importance 
of data and information, it is also important to treat and develop data as an essential commercial asset (McKinsey 
Digital,2015). This means that data needs to be actively managed at all stages of the data lifecycle (i.e., collected, 
stored, analyzed, shared, and archived) through defined data practices, standards, and policies (Pinheiro, 2018). Law 
13,709 / 2018 impacts private and public companies throughout the country, considering any size and market segment, 
taking into account the need to meet requirements efficiently and sustainably (Maldonado, 2019).  
 
1.1. Objectives 
 
The aim of this article is to characterize the main areas of contribution to the evaluation of the capability of the digital 
transformation process in relation to cybersecurity in the context of the General Data Protection Act and present some 
topics in which field research could be further developed. 
 
2. Methodology 
 
The research in this work was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, a research was conducted with the keywords 
derived from the initial readings, in papers published in journals and conferences. In the second phase, some of the 
main references in the field were analyzed in order to identify areas of contribution to future research and

Abstract 
 
Customer segmentation is increasingly needed in a context where customer interests are vital for companies to survive. 
This study proposes the use of the weighted RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) supported by data mining 
techniques and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), to classify the customers according to their lifetime value 
(CLV). The customer segments obtained can be used to boost marketing strategies, as these segments enable to 
differentiate the customers. Each segment of customers is described by a set of rules based on the customers’ 
purchasing patterns. The methodology developed is validated by using a real case study, i.e. a food industry company, 
whose core business is the production of biscuits.

1. Introduction 
 
Customers should be seen as one of the most critical business assets for companies’ success (Van den Poel and 
Lariviere 2004), but not all of them can be managed equally. Targeting customers properly means categorising them 
to provide valuable relationships, that may exceed their expectations. Given the impossibility of any market offer to 
satisfy all markets and their respective individuals, segmentation appears as an important marketing tool (Assael and 
Roscoe Jr 1976, Constantinides and Zinck Stagno 2011). Wedel and Kamakura (2002) reinforce this idea by stating 
that segmentation has become a need for marketers since it is the only possible way to save money and efforts that 
directly affect companies’ profit. Segmentation assumes that customers with similar purchasing needs and patterns 
tend to demonstrate a similar response to marketing actions (Tsai and Chiu 2004).  Ngai, Xiu et al. (2009) also mention 
that segmentation enables to obtain a deeper understanding of a specific market and an enhanced capacity to identify 
and explore opportunities for commercial profit. The result of a good segmentation allows organisations to define their 
objectives (Lamb, Hair et al. 2008). 
 
Companies need to know the customers, what they want and how much they are willing to pay (Kotler 2000). 
However, for many companies, it is difficult to understand customers' needs, especially if there is no direct interaction. 
However, the vast amount of data organizations is collecting, if used properly, enable to discover important patterns 
and trends. For this purpose, data mining techniques have gained relevance in Customer Relationship management 
(CRM) context (Berson, Smith et al. 2000).

According to the assessments obtained through the AHP, a consistency ratio (CR) of 7.7% was achieved, which 
validates the model. The resulting relative weights of the variables were: 𝑤𝑤𝑅𝑅 =0,073, 𝑤𝑤𝐹𝐹 =0,166 and 𝑤𝑤𝑀𝑀 = 0,761. 
Having these values, for each customer, it was estimated a weighted RFM. Thus, their individual normalised R, F and 
M were combined using the weights obtained from AHP. Note that in the case of Recency, the complementary to one 
was taken, as the higher its value, the less value should be given to its customer. This parameter differs from frequency 
and monetary, where their values have a direct relation to the weight to be given. 
 
By comparing the average weighted of the parameters of RFM, it is possible to rank customers according to their CLV 
- Table 7. For example, segment number 5 has the highest CLV value. In this case, most of its customers have recently 
purchased, with the highest buy-per-transaction average. These customers show the characteristics of a very valuable 
segment whose segmentation strategies should consider these specifications.

5. Conclusions and Future Work 
 
This paper aims at demonstrating how a customer-centric analysis can be created through the application of data 
mining techniques and AHP. Two segmentation models were presented, being the first one selected, considering the 
feasibility of implementation. Subsequently, the respective CLV for each segment of customers was estimated. 
 
The objective of the customers segmentation is not only to identify segments, but to discover how they can articulate 
and integrate into the 4P strategy (Price, Place, Product and Promotion). As a next step, it is necessary to explore the 
development of the strategy to be launched, resulting from the segmentation process. With the information resulting 
from this study, the company could define a different strategy depending on the type of clusters. For the segment 
referring to the lowest value, marketing campaigns and discounts could be launched to stimulate buying, make current 
products known (for example, by providing samples), promote experimentation, dispose of products or blur 
seasonality of consumption. For clusters that currently have a higher value, premium treatment and a closer 
relationship with the customers, is recommended to maintain customer value. Given the company's focus on 
innovation and the consequent launch of new products, it could be interesting to involve the most valuable customers 
in the ideation and/or to guarantee exclusive sales, in order to reinforce their special nature. 
 
Throughout the development of this project, most of the time was spent on processing the information provided by 
the company, which corroborates with several data mining studies that emphasize that the preparation stage is one of 
the most relevant and often time-consuming aspects of these type of projects (Khajvand, Zolfaghar et al. 2011, Bunnak, 
Thammaboosadee et al. 2015). This reinforces the importance of keeping information organized and up to date, 
providing a central point of consultation and record of information.

275","Despite the relevance of the study, some limitations regarding the results should be noted. Some other factors, mainly 
important variables in the food industry, could be considered in the segmentation models in order to achieve more 
significant profiles (e.g.: production changeover times). Moreover, the variable related to the duration of the customer 
relationship (LRFM) could be included in the RFM model. In the current version of the study, due to the manual 
required effort to obtain the contractual duration of the customers, this variable was not considered.  
 
As future work, the study of the first approach should be expanded to accommodate the last three years of data (2016 
- 2018).

1. Introduction  
Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) has gained relevance and attention from the academic and practitioner 
communities over the past decade. SSCM is known by the integration approach an organization’s social, 
environmental and economic. Some aspects influence the adoption of SSCM as greening supply chains, characteristics 
of suppliers, managerial approaches, barriers and benefits (Bask et al. 2018; Movahedipour, 2017; Jaegler, 2016; 
Ageron et al. 2012). SSCM practices leads to improved environmental and economic performance which positively 
impact on operational and organizational performance (Dos Santos et al. 2018; Green Jr et al. 2012). 
In the existing literature some important aspects on SSCM should be managed as information system to translate 
uncertainties into information (Busse et al. 2017a), SSCM performance measures and metrics (Jakhar, 2015; Ahi and 
Searcy, 2015), circular economy (Genovese et al. 2017), managerial commitment to SSCM projects (Gattiker et al. 
2014),  
Systematic review helps to analyze data logically, and to reveal patterns and conclusions that may not be immediately 
obvious. The research includes an overview of publications which show a close relationship to the study. In scientific 
articles, generally considered key characteristics are a significant contributor to current knowledge and expansion of 
the scientific frontier (Ricker, 2017). 
The development of this research was highlighted by innovative analysis on systematic review of literature using ABC 
XYZ approach. ABC is about the use of Pareto’s Law (80/20 rule) items are grouped based on their level of 
importance. XYZ is about the use of Coefficient of Variation (CV) it measures the variability of a series of numbers 
independently of the unit of measurement used for these numbers. 
The aim of this paper is to contribute to a systematic mapping analysis of SSCM literature. This paper is organized as 
follows: Theoretical background presents the significant research activities on SSCM literature. Research 
methodology describe the steps on systematic mapping analysis. Data collection presents the search details of 
publications on SSCM. Data analysis considers the ABC XYZ approach on SSCM. Conclusion is dedicated to 
summarize the contributions of this research to SSCM literature.

Abstract  
 
This paper is part of a research that involves the nine technologies of industry 4.0 applied to the textile sector. Here 
the focus is the literature review made with the SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Tool) software. The tool 
analyzed was the Additive Manufacturing, but the papers showed the term most used is the synonym three-
dimensional printing. The first time the term appeared in publications was in 2016. This paper will present the steps 
for implementing additive manufacturing, textile industry applications, as well as advantages and challenges. The 
results showed that machine adaptations are relatively easy with the introduction of accessories and examples 
include smart textiles such as electronic parts, seamless or cut fabrics, and even entire parades with all parts made on 
the 3D printer. However, it is still necessary to develop models that adapt to different bodies, adjusting with greater 
flexibility, improving the production process through an automatic selection of needles.

1. Introduction 
 
Additive Manufacturing is the formal term for what is popularly defined as three-dimensional printing (3D) 
(Straub 2017, Gibson et al. 2014, Matthews 2017).  The technology has been known to the industry since the 1970s, 
but initially it was only used in prototyping and simulation. From the 2000s onwards, it was also used in the 
production of finished products. According Gibson et al. (2014), from then on, the first applications of technology 
specifically in the textile area emerged. 
 
Second Borgianni et al. (2017), initially, the technology was used in the industry to rapidly prototype developing 
products, serving as a basis for analysis, adjustment and approval. In short, this technology consists of creating 
physical models by printing data from a virtual model where complete products or parts of them are manufactured 
directly by printing (Straub 2017, Borgianni et al. 2017). 
 
Thus, it can be stated that Additive Manufacturing is a process where a variety of Technologies convert data 
from virtual models into physical models quickly and easily (Sabantina 2015). The data is transformed into a series 
of two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections of determined thickness, which will be sequentially deposited by a printer

Abstract 
 
Predictive maintenance, one of the important topics in industrial data analysis, mainly focuses on predicting 
when the machine or device will be broken or malfunctioned based on the traceability of sensor data 
collected from machines or devices. In the previous research works, time-series data analysis of the health 
status of the machine under fixed maintenance mode or fixed recession cycle is studied. In this research, 
the data fusion model is proposed to improve the overall accuracy through the combination of various-data 
driven technologies with the time series prediction method. The experimental result based on hydraulic 
system condition monitoring data shows that the proposed fusion model can provide better maintenance 
decision making on the machine/device maintenance plan based on the relatively small or data with 
incomplete maintenance cycle.

Abstract 
 
Research conducted since the 1990s shows that the high failure and retention rates of small and medium-
sized enterprises are due to administrative deficiencies and low technological adoption. Therefore, a 
possible solution to both low sustainability and low productivity may be the implementation of a 
sustainability management model that improves these indicators. 
Sustainability and productivity are two terms that have taken great importance when involving the concept 
of organization, this concept has been becoming a major factor for companies because it involves each and 
every one of the different types of companies and business ideas that Colombia has, since sustainability is 
strongly related to entrepreneurship and globalization in order to create economic, environmental and social 
value in the present and future, according to this, the research aims to determine the level of productivity 
after the implementation of the Sustainability Management Model. The detailed review to identify its 
applicability in the SMEs, to define categories of analysis, the profiles of the organizations and to carry out 
the diagnosis of the organizational management, are the aspects to consider in this project.

Small and medium enterprises (SME's) in Colombia are the engine of business productivity. Various studies show 
the importance of these organizations in different sectors and the impact they have on the community and the 
productive environment in which they operate. On the other hand, different academic studies supported by the 
different associations have shown high rates of failure in keeping these organizations in the market due to 
administrative deficiencies and low technological adoption. Therefore, a possible solution to both the low 
sustainability and productivity, may be the implementation of a sustainability management model that improves 
these indicators (Figure 1).

302",,"Methodology 
This research project has as its starting point, the Descriptive Study on Information Management and the 
Application of ICTs in Small Businesses in Bogotá, which allowed the establishment of a series of shortcomings in 
organizational management in the 130 SMEs (Mosquera-Laverde and Vásquez-Bernal, 2015), allowed the 
identification of categories and dimensions for the present work; hence this study depends on and is consistent with 
previous research in the three participating universities. 
 
The proposed research has an action implementation (AI) scope, since it seeks to measure the impact of the 
sustainability management model, through a pilot test and thus optimize the productivity of small businesses in 
Bogotá. In this sense, it is based on four categories that encompass everything that must be considered in an 
organization to be sustainable and with which the impact can be measured as they are: Economic, Social, 
Organizational, Regulatory. These categories will be verified by means of dimensions (for example, Direct 
Economic Impact, Indirect Economic Impact) and sub-dimensions (for example, Customers, Suppliers, Employees, 
Investors, Public Sector, as well as, Competition, International Market), which guarantees the relevance of the data 
that will be obtained through the instruments. 
 
Expected results 
As a result of this research will be to promote an analysis tool for the improvement in the management of 
sustainability in small and medium enterprises in Bogotá D.C., in order to establish strategies for improvement in 
organizational management that adapt these organizations to be more efficient in the use of their resources, the 
development and improvement of their sustainable production processes. To this end, the results of the research will 
be taken into account in order to strengthen the support and advisory services provided to the SMEs in the study. 
 
On the other hand, the development of research products to generate new knowledge and social appropriation is 
contemplated, which will help to disseminate the findings in the academic and business fields.

Abstract 
Port community systems (PCS), as platforms for connecting the actors of a port community, 
build a basis for improving information exchange. These systems support automation and 
visibility, thereby helping to enhance the overall port community performance. However, for a 
successful development of a PCS, it is necessary to use an appropriate design methodology. In 
the literature, it is common to find different methodologies for the design of electronic tools. 
However, this is not the case for products and services related to port communities. Therefore, 
this study analyzes and identifies a suitable design methodology for PCS, supported by a case 
study in Barranquilla, Colombia. One of the main findings is that the context, the geographical 
environment, the technological development and the cultural factor were key factors for the 
development and implementation of PCS. Taking the above into account, we propose in this 
research a new methodology for the design of PCS. 
Keywords  
Design methodologies, port communities, port community system, case study. 
 
1.  Introduction 
A Port Community System (PCS) can be defined as an inter-organizational system for promoting 
commercial services and information exchange between the port and its customers and a variety of stakeholders, 
such as forwarders, carriers, importers, exporters, and customs, among others (EPCSA 2015). This way, a PCS is 
a tool that can enhance the information flow between all of them by electronically integrating heterogeneous 
compositions of public and private stakeholders, technologies, systems, processes, and standards within a port 
community (Heilig et al. 2017). 
According to recent studies (Atkinson and McKay 2007; Carlan et al. 2016) the benefits of a PCS, from 
a digital economic perspective, is to provide employees with a tool to help them increase their productivity, 
allowing companies to drastically improve their internal operations efficiency and automation of daily works. 
Magutu et al. (2010) assured that electronic exchange of communications produces a faster and more efficient 
exchange of information, reduces the number of errors and reduces the lead time of processes. Also, Gustafsson 
(2007) exposed that, in terms of visibility, having an operational PCS makes the port much less opaque since the 
information that is crucial for each stakeholder of the chain can be individually valued by others as well. 
Over the years it has been proven how a PCS implementation has allowed ports to improve and stand out 
in terms of productivity, competitiveness, innovation and customer service. In the Netherlands, the implementation 
of a PCS made it possible to completely eliminate the use of paper in foreign trade operations (Čišić et al. 2009).  
According to Čišić et al. (2009) the monetary savings obtained by the use of e-documents (compared to the 
traditional, paper documents) can reach the amount of 38.79%, the savings in time up to 39.64% and the use of 
electronic communication can save 39% of the flow of documents and affect the profitability of the entire port 
community. But how can be designed and developed a PCS? Are PCS the same for each port community?

4. Prototype testing  
For the validation of the PCS prototype, it is necessary to test it with its expected users. The prototype 
was presented to the Information Technology staff of the selected port, in which the design of the prototype was 
evaluated satisfactorily. However, several feedbacks were received, each recommendation is listed below:  
o 
Include the option in the model that the client or the forwarder could create import cases, since 
only the shipping company could start and/or open the case of an import. 
o 
In the initial part of the import process, when the shipping company requests the confirmation 
of terminal available docks, a specialized capacity restriction must be included and taken into 
account based on the characteristics of the vessel in question, and not generalize this restriction 
of capacity for all the vessels of the case. 
o 
In the confirmation activity of the vessel, the Bill of Lading, and the other required documents 
must be requested. 
o 
The different stakeholders must be notified when the freight is in the warehouse, in order to start 
making the preparations to dispatching the products from the port. 
o 
Parameterize the activity of the event in which the confirmation of receiving the vessel is 
rejected. 
o 
In the content of the Bill of Lading, the location of the container ID with the type of cargo must 
be changed (""one switch"") in order to improve the presentation of this and generate greater 
coherence. 
o 
In the activity of notifying the state of the cargo, the options for the types of deterioration of the 
cargo must be expanded, to be able to choose several options from it, and to be able to attach 
photos associated with the deterioration of the merchandise. In addition, a field should be placed 
where the quantity of the cargo that presents deterioration is specified. 
o 
In the section of filling in the “tarja” (weighting the cargo after downloaded it from the vessels), 
the information of the amount of the load should not be placed, in order to avoid manipulation 
of the quantities, risks and/or misunderstandings from the staff. 
o 
In the tax payment activity, a receipt or proof of payment must be attached. 
 
Taking into account the above recommendation, a new interaction of the prototype was made; which was 
re-presented and finally accepted by personnel of the area of technologies of the selected port. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Moros-Daza et al. (Moros-Daza et al. 2017) asserts that a port community system is a great option to 
apply and develop in the Colombian port community. However, to achieve this, it is necessary to first evaluate 
some aspects such as feasibility, design, validation and limitations of a prototype.  
In the literature, it is common to find different methodologies for the design of electronic tools (Cooley 
2000; Dreyfuss 1955; García López and Cuevas Salazar 2009; Norman and Draper 1986). However, none of them 
is focused on port communities. Port communities are part of a very specific and complex market, with needs that 
cannot be fulfilled with the current methodologies (Moros-Daza et al. 2020). Also, it was found on a previous 
study (Moros-Daza et al. 2018), that in order to design and develop a PCS, key factors needed to be taken into

316","account, i.e.: the context, the geographical environment, the technological development, and the culture. 
Considering the above, this research aimed to evaluate the most used design methodologies based on the key 
factors and to propose a new match methodology specific for PCS developments, taking as a case study the port 
community of the Colombian Caribbean Coast.  
We proposed a new design methodology for the development of electronic tools for port communities. 
This methodology takes into account four phases: user experience, creativity, selection, and design and execution. 
The first phase was based on the match between the basic design thinking proposal and the NADI methodology. 
But, taking into account that this methodology is for the development and implementation of PCS, a proposed 
opening step for the methodology now involves an initial analysis of the environment (Abras et al. 2004).  
The second phase was named creativity, which involves six steps: define, ideate, solutions, model design, 
technological system and prototype. The third phase was the selection phase, which was made by a match of all 
the previous methodologies. This phase is composed by the following steps: ideate, solutions, model design, 
technological system, prototype, performance and manufacturability. Finally, phase four is design and execution. 
This phase features the intersection between the design thinking and the concurrent engineering methodologies, 
where steps like performance, manufacturability, implement and test should be analyzed and taking into account 
in order to make a proper development and implementation of a PCS. As a case study, we portrayed a platform 
tailored to the needs of each of the stakeholders of the Colombian Caribbean port community.

Abstract 
 
The perishability of blood components and uncertainty in both donation and demand scale are two important reason 
that contributing to blood shortage. According to the WHO’s global statistics, 107 out of 180 countries struggle with 
an insufficient amount of blood units to meet currently existing demand for blood products. This paper proposes a 2-
stage location-allocation blood supply chain network which aims to optimize blood inventory level by minimizing the 
total related costs. Various ordering policies, lateral transshipment between hospitals, emergency orders from blood 
centers, limited capacity for each centers, and blood aging process have been considered in the form of constraints. 
The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has been considered as the case study focus for this research, and all the further 
necessary actions and recommendations have been taken based on the case study’s results.

1. Introduction 
 
The high rate of blood components’ perishability and the fact that humans are only resource of supplying these 
products make blood supply chain as one of the most crucial and complicated supply chains that exists in today’s 
world. Due to blood’s life-saving characteristic, the value of using an integrated model to prevent both shortage and 
wastage is undeniable. This paper discusses an integrated system of a blood supply chain on a real-world example. 
The main objective of the proposed supply chain is to minimize all the related cost in order to optimize inventory level 
in both hospitals and blood centers and set a balance between shortage and wastage amounts. To make the model 
closer to the real-world situation, ability to issue an emergency order in case of shortage has been accounted in the 
proposed model as well. 
2. Literature Review  
 
All over the world, blood supply chains are facing with various challenges like an increase in operating costs, rise in 
competition among blood centers, donors’ motivation, seasonal shortages and blood components’ perishability. 
(Dutta, 2019) An organized inventory management that achieved by understanding the complex interrelations of 
supply and demand, and other factors that affect them would be fruitful to discover the blood supply chain 
configuration that should be used in order to overcome this complexity. (Chapman el al, 2004) Moreover, Blood 
supply chain is considered as one of the key players in the healthcare system. Hence, any improvement in blood 
management can have a significant impact on the performance of the healthcare system. (Zahiri et al, 2015). 
Considering multi-period planning horizon, perishability of blood, uncertainty in demands and supplies, blood 
substitution transfusion, and blood delivery system framework are the elements that affect blood supply chain 
improvement. (Zahiri et al, 2015; Kaveh and Ghobadi, 2017). 
2.1.Simulation Approach to Identify the System 
 
Although forecasting method are mainly recognized as tools that can improve sales for the commercial companies, 
ability to forecast the amount of blood components’ demands can be considered as an effective step which can both 
reduce the stress that exist in both blood centers and hospitals, and increase the efficiency. (Caulfield, 2013) In today’s 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

319",,"in each period of time, shortage and wastage amount of each hospital due to its demand, wastage amount of each blood 
center due to the amount of collected platelet and delivered platelet units, and the platelets amount which will be 
transferred in emergency situation from hospitals and blood centers. 
7.2. Future Recommendations 
 
Considering uncertainty in both platelet supply and demands, various transportation modes and their specific capacity, 
ability to establish temporary blood centers in case of need, the effects of existing environmental errors such as test 
results’ errors, staffs’ errors, etc., and changing the condition of the proposed model to stochastic can be considered 
as the potential future research directions.

Abstract  
Metals are important materials in engineering applications and the additive manufacturing is a set of processes and 
technologies presents in Industry 4.0. The direct production of metallic components by manufacturing additive is an 
interesting alternative for organizations add values to components and finished products. This article presents an 
overview on the metallic parts direct production by additive manufacturing. An analysis of the literature was conducted 
to investigate advanced metals and processes of additive manufacturing used to produce metallic components, 
specifically selective laser melting (SLM), selective laser sintering (SLS) and electron beam melting (EBM). The 
mechanism of layer fully melting and solidification process allow that SLM and EBM produce components with 
superior mechanical properties than SLS process, considering the same metallic material in manufacturing.

 1. Introduction  
In these days, society presents a scenario of increasingly demanding consumers and volatile markets where there is 
no space for industry failure. As a result, full production control is required to ensure quality, flexibility and 
productivity in the manufacturing process. Industry 4.0 requires interaction between automation, communication and 
information and manufacturing technologies, enabling productive differentials such as the possibility of mass 
customization of products and services and the pursuit of continuous innovation. Industry 4.0 is a term that 
encompasses some technologies for automation and data exchange and uses concepts of cyberphysical systems, 
internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing. Other important dimensions of Industry 4.0 are big data, autonomous 
robots, simulations, systems integration, cybersecurity, augmented reality and additive manufacturing.

In comparison to subtractive manufacturing by computer numerical control (CNC), in which the machine tool 
operations are controlled by a part program, additive manufacturing processes have numerous advantages: design 
flexibility, low material wastage (do not form chips); efficient use of energy (sustainability); no fixing devices 
required; no tool change is required during component manufacturing; the component is manufactured in one 
component from start to finish; no complex calculations of tool paths are required; and AM avoids of the CNC part 
programming task.  
The disadvantages of AM technologies include limited variety of materials [for example, steriolithography (SL) works 
only photopolymers]; components accuracy lower than components made by subtractive manufacturing (especially as 
layer thickness is increased); mechanical performance of the fabricated components by AM is worst than components 
produced by other processes such as forging or machining; and high equipment cost. Specifically, EBM includes the 
limitations associated with performing the process in a vacuum. 
6. Conclusions 
Selective laser melting (SLM), selective laser sintering (SLS) and electron beam melting (EBM) are interesting ways 
of produce metallic components, directly. In times of Industry 4.0, the advantages of additive manufacturing (AM), 
particularly its design flexibility and low material wastage, become these processes important alternatives the 
integration of metal AM into current and future production systems. Considering the same metallic material in 
manufacturing, SLM and EBM show better mechanical behavior than SLS because they have layer fully melting and 
solidification process, while SLS has not the ability to do so. Ferrous and nonferrous metals continue to be crucial in 
engineering because these materials allow technological viability in terms of optimization of manufacturing processes, 
materials and desired properties.

Abstract 
 
The research carried out in SMEs shows that to improve organizational processes, great developments have been 
achieved, but then, in an impact and follow-up study it was determined that there are high failure and retention rates 
of small and medium-sized enterprises, since, Improvements are not implemented or implemented with little 
effectiveness. Reason why, to solve this problem, organizational change must be studied and how these models are 
implemented or can be implemented in industrial SMEs. 
For this, different models of organizational change that SMEs employ are studied and compared with the 
organizational management implemented, to achieve a diagnosis and define the criteria and sub-criteria necessary for 
an AHP analysis methodology, with the results obtained, it is intended to establish a method that achieves the real 
change in SMEs

Introduction 
 
Organizational management in industrial SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) and organizational change 
management has improved, but not making decisions for growth improves their productivity. In the last two decades, 
a working group has been brewing by a growing number of researchers who are interested in studying the processes 
of globalization from a value chain perspective (Gereffi, Humphrey, Kaplinsky and Sturgeon, 2001; Kaplinsky and 
Morris, 2001). Gereffi (1994), the term global value chains is used to refer to international links between companies 
with global production and distribution systems. In parallel, small industries have been experiencing continuous 
organizational economic growth and deep diversification, to be positioned as one of the key drivers of current global 
socioeconomic progress (Saavedra,2020). 
The importance of the contribution of the tourism industry to global economic activity is completely unquestionable. 
The World Tourism Organization estimates its contribution to world GDP at around 5% (UNWTO, 2012). In terms 
of job creation, its impact would be slightly higher (6-7%), with more than 235 million jobs registered - direct and 
indirect - worldwide (ILO, 2010). However, the relevance of the role of tourism in achieving economic development 
is not an issue on which a consensus has still been reached by the international community, with conflicting positions.

341",,"must be synthesized through the prioritization of alternatives and criteria (Saaty, 2015) in compliance with objectives 
three and four as shown in Figure 1. 
  
With the results of the previous analysis, the fifth objective will be met to design a knowledge management 
methodology to apply in ecotourism SMEs that accept the invitation to research and the analysis of the improvement 
of their productivity. Also, it is important to clarify that the data collection will be done at a specific time and to a 
single sample so its design is: non-experimental, transversal. Thus, by analyzing the data we will achieve the 
familiarization of the topic under study in this case the management of organizational change in ecotourism SMEs 
located in Cundinamarca and Boyacá.  
 
 
Expected results 
 
As a result of this research, a method will be promoted to efficiently implement organizational change management 
models in small and medium-sized enterprises in Cundinamarca Colombia with the purpose of improving productivity, 
and thereby implementing strategies for improving organizational management that adapt these organizations to be 
more efficient in the use of their resources, the development and improvement of their production processes. To this 
end, the results of the investigation will be considered to strengthen the support and advice services provided to SMEs 
in the study. 
 
On the other hand, the development of research products to generate new knowledge and social appropriation is 
contemplated, which will help disseminate the findings in the academic and business fields.

Abstract 
This article describes a collaborative logistic model to improve the medicines and medical devices supply chain in 
hospitals in Colombia using Systemic Thinking methodologies to identify value flows problems. The exploratory 
study was developed in 3 stages: the supply chain analysis and characterization from producers to patients, the 
archetypes identification and modeling that impact the collaborative logistic and the further model proposed to 
improve interactions between network actors, through literature analysis, interviews and validation of supply chain 
experts. 
A result from the bibliographic review is that to achieve collaboration strategies it is necessary to consider three main 
supply chain attributes: visibility, velocity and variability since current traditional supply chain model and identified 
archetypes found present multiple failures, which prevent prompt access to medical treatment and visibility throughout 
the supply chain.  
Given the above, we proposed a collaborative logistic systemic model for the supply chain of medicines and medical 
devices, whose relevant variables are visibility, efficient service and product availability. Considering as fundamental 
pillars the trust between the parties, the importance of right use and implementation of the norm, and the proper 
creation of value flows in the processes that characterize the system.

Abstract  
 
Over the past few decades, the curriculum guidelines for higher education offered by Brazilian public and private 
institutions have emphasized the importance of developing competencies and skills that enable the graduate to 
perform his or her professional activities more efficiently and effectively and with a high level of social 
responsibility. Institutions, in this context, have followed different paths in offering courses that meet these 
guidelines, and, in several of these institutions, entrepreneurial education has gained particular emphasis. 
Entrepreneurial education also involves the development of skills considered fundamental for the education of 
professionals for the 21st century. This paper aims to analyze the contribution of a student organization focused on 
entrepreneurship to the efforts associated with entrepreneurial education in the context of a private Higher Education 
Institution. The method adopted to achieve the proposed objective is based on qualitative and quantitative aspects, by 
associating the realization of a case study with the application of a questionnaire to the students impacted by the 
initiatives of the student organization. Among the main results are the evidence that the student organization had, 
during its first year of existence, a substantial impact on the entrepreneurial education of the participating students, 
increasing the desire to create their startup as well as contributing to the dissemination of practical knowledge about  
entrepreneurial activity, rivaling the excessively theoretical teaching that students receive in the classroom.

Abstract  
 
The Brazilian Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) represent over 98% of all active companies in the country in 
2020. The role of innovation in processes must receive special attention, which leads us to write this article to measure 
the Dimensions of Innovation in companies. The Radar of Innovation was applied to support the model of the 
diagnostic method tool, which was established to perform data analysis with the needs of each organization. Through 
this methodology, analyzing the 12 Dimensions of Innovation for a sample of 20 SMEs in the manufacturing segment, 
in the south region of São Paulo, is used for the research fieldwork. The role was to promote recommendations and 
collaboration, to improve the opportunities to be replicated in other organizations with similar challenges. The 
contribution of this work is the Dimension Processes, since most participants had common results. They all found the 
need to differentiate themselves from their competitors.

3786",,"changes or maturation process. SMEs normally have a lack of capital investment, and therefore, 
seek to work in other dimensions that may have more short-term returns, such as reducing costs, 
or focusing on direct sales. 
The authors found that although these companies were framed by their revenues as small 
businesses, their management style proved to be closer to micro-businesses, with weak 
administrative operations. The entrepreneurs were focused on productive activities or routines and 
struggled to keep qualified employees. This resulted in, production bottlenecks and insufficient 
incentives for innovation. 
Managers' greatest difficulty was the delegation of manual, routine duties. Often, they 
chose the manual work over the administrative tasks, leaving the administrative tasks unchecked. 
It can also be argued that the Dimension Process was not regarded as a priority by employers. In 
general, entrepreneurs tend to resist change in their businesses, avoiding risks. 
Some of the suggested actions to improve the Dimension Process, were the standardization 
of production processes; development planning; control of production processes; implementation 
of quality tools; cultivation of partnership with other companies and suppliers to streamline 
inventories; documentation of inventory for finished products; and management of raw materials 
and waste, for example, recycling resale waste. 
None of the companies analyzed had professionals allocated to developing or deploying 
innovations. Furthermore, none of the companies was able to hit a strong overall diagnosis mark. 
Consequently, companies are not considered innovative in the manufacturing segment. In this case, 
we can see a major deficiency in the processes of small businesses in the south region of São Paulo. 
 
5. Final considerations 
 
This article's main component is to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation in 
the Dimension Processes in the interviewed companies. Note, small businesses have a lot in 
common, for example, most began as micro or family businesses, and after their growth, had a 
financial gain, as well as an increase in the number of employees, etc. 
The lack of strategic planning and strong management practices that aligned with the 
company's values, a context that was addressed in the analysis of the results, greatly limited the 
potential for innovation in small businesses. A culture of innovation as a continuous process 
depends on robust management, skilled and motivated employees, to power innovation as a means 
of stimulating the development of the organization.

Abstract 
 
This article aims to present the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution focused on the main technologies and their application 
and implementation in some companies in the state of São Paulo. The article proposes a case study with 30 companies in the Sorocaba 
region. The CIOs (Chief Information Officer) surveyed indicated that they have difficulties in understanding what are the best practices in 
Industry 4.0 and what solutions should be chosen to achieve what their investors and customers expect. Technological innovation and the 
potential for innovation are becoming indispensable for the improvement of the researched industries, however they indicate the need for 
more adaptation of their plants for a good adoption of this new technology.

1. Introduction 
 
With the emergence of the Industry 4.0 theme, first mentioned in 2011 in the city of Hanover by the German government, 
organizations came to have a more global and systematic view of production management and the provision of integrated and automatic 
information for decision making. But what is this term being discussed in various forums and congresses around the world? 
To Kumar (2018) ""Simply put, Industry 4.0 represents smart factories with cutting-edge platforms that support plant operations 
with the ability to think and interact with each other perfectly as a unit."" 
According to Klaus (2016) the Fourth Industrial Revolution is a phenomenon unlike anything ever experienced by humanity until 
nowadays, and cites three reasons to support this evolution: Speed, which unlike other revolutions has grown exponentially, Amplitude and 
depth that has the digital revolution as its foundation combined with other new technologies, and the Systemic impact that involves the 
transformation of entire systems. 
With all these changes we need to know how we can deal with this concept. Souza (2018) mentions that “it is necessary to 
understand that Industry 4.0 offers a range of deployment possibilities for the company, but these are not always viable”. He also mentions 
that “it is not necessary for your industry to be 4.0, for all available technologies to be adopted, because it would be unfeasible even in 
countries with the most developed Industry 4.0.” Thus, Brazil that is still in a transition phase, faces greater difficulty in implementing this 
process. 
Souza (2018) also mentions that, with the advancement of technologies and especially with the use of the internet connecting all 
devices, we will have a very important leap for digital evolution. Klaus (2016) considers that companies need a new mindset to satisfy their 
own needs and says that the innovation process is a complex social process and not something that we should accept as inevitable. 
Both Yáñez (2018) and Souza (2018) report Lean Manufacturing as a tool that plays a key role in this Industry 4.0 deployment 
stage, it meets the philosophy where we can produce more with new technology with much less. 
But what should the factories of the future look like? Souza (2018) points out that “the first step towards the implementation of 
Industry 4.0 is the modernization of machines or the acquisition of new machines”. He also mentions that the second step is due to the 
acquisition of devices that can integrate the data generated by these machines, that is, connectivity, and it is in this second stage that 
information technology plays a fundamental role. 
According to Yáñez (2018) factories must be automated, to gain speed in processes, must be digital with the possibility of capturing 
massive, intelligent data where the collected data can be interpreted facilitating the decision process and flexibility. Enterprises that want to 
deploy Industry 4.0 technologies to improve their competitiveness in products and services find it difficult to find answers, relying on 
complex and global solutions with numerous technologies that are considered essential for companies to be rated 4.0. What technological

351",,"Figure 7. What companies are looking for with the Fourth Industrial Revolution 
 
In addition to decision making, the graph shows that Industry 4.0 can bring an improvement in production processes, so Lean 
Manufacturing is a methodology cited by several authors that can help companies in this information mapping step, identifying which items 
are important. and how to improve your production process. 
5. Final Considerations 
 
This paper identified that the concept of Industry 4.0 still poses many questions for organizations to invest heavily in technologies 
that are not yet widespread and are far from the regional reality. For this reason, it is presumed to be premature to say that the technologies 
mentioned in the article may supply the need for companies in the concept of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the short term. It is noticed 
that each company has to map its needs and thus invest in technologies that can provide the connectivity of machines and equipment and 
thus provide the strategic information for the companies. The questionnaire applied to professionals from various companies showed that 
the tendency of companies is to invest in connectivity technologies such as IoT technology and cloud computing. There was also a tendency 
for data storage technology. (Big Data), a more detailed study of these choices is suggested to verify the reason for these trends. Another 
factor that suggests a more detailed study is about machine automation since many companies still have old machines that do not allow 
connection for data collection. Lean Manufacturing can also be explored for future research as the authors cite the methodology as an aid 
to Industry 4.0 for work on process improvement.

Introduction 
The model of doing business in the world has changed mainly due to globalization and new trends technological, 
phenomena that also involve changes cultural, political, social and environmental influencing the business field as 
they generate volatility in the markets (Reyes, M., Reyes, B., and Flores R., 2018), in response to these global, national 
and local environment changes, companies make mergers, strategic alliances, make up business networks, production 
chains, clusters, are aggregated into legal figures such as cooperatives, associative work companies and others 
modalities (Avendaño,2014).  The various forms of association that make up companies, they have the purpose of 
strengthening themselves to compete in a market globalized and complex, where smaller companies are they are 
threatened and tend to disappear, creating an effect negative not only for the economy of the country but also for the

Abstract 
This presentation reviews the contents, organization and logistics of an undergraduate-level engineering 
course which aims to introduce students to the “big picture” of engineering activities revolving around the 
process of ideation and new product development. While primarily focusing on principles of modern 
manufacturing, connects them with product design and business process issues, and places them in the 
context of two important trends: globalization and entrepreneurship. 
The course aims to analyze the technical and business dimensions of various manufacturing paradigms, and 
identify concepts relevant to globalization and fragmented markets. It also emphasizes creativity in 
designing global products and introduces 2nd year engineering students to basic concepts of 
entrepreneurship by using Lean Startup approach for starting new, technology-driven companies. 
The main feature of the course is a semester-long project in which students work in teams. Every team 
consists of up to 5 students, and it is preferred when each student brings to the team a different background 
and experience. The team assignment is to create a start-up company offering a new product type that 
potentially fits mass-customization markets on a global scale (e.g., has potential to be offered on multiple 
national markets). The team has to (1) develop product idea and its design, including multiple product 
variations, (2) create an outline of the manufacturing processes and system necessary to make the product, 
and (3) define a business model that covers delivery, organization and cost and profit issues. 
While the class has been offered since 2009, in its subsequent edition its contents go over multiple revisions 
and updates. The most recent modification consisted of merging the course (which usually has over 200 
students enrolled) with a separate course on entrepreneurship offered by a business school. As a result, each 
engineering team was enhanced by addition of an undergraduate student from business. As a result of these 
changes, new patterns in student behavior started to emerge. Presence of business students and became a 
significant motivational factor. Interdisciplinarity of the teams received natural boost, which eventually led 
not only to heightened creativity, but also to mutual appreciation of skillsets associated with collaborating 
disciplines; it also facilitated vertical integration of students at various stages of their studies and 
experiences. Use of the Lean Startup methodology, which requires the participants continuously verify their 
design and market hypotheses, has also raised awareness among engineering students that in their 
professional development they need to broaden the scope of their studies and add management, 
communication and entrepreneurial abilities to their skillset.

competitiveness and sustainable development of the Brazilian automotive industry. 
Industry 4.0 is based on nine pillars: big data, autonomous robots, simulation, vertical and horizontal integration 
systems, internet of things, cyber-physical systems, cloud, additive manufacturing or 3D printing and augmented 
reality (MOTYL et.al, 2017) 
In Brazil, although there are still obstacles to the transition from industries to Industry 4.0, this transition enables 
synergy of different technologies, enabling smarter and more efficient factories that can foster economic growth and 
development (BRETTEL et al., 2014). In this sense, making investments emerges as an important necessity for the 
possibility of infrastructure adaptation and qualification of manpower for this passage (LORENZ et. Al, 2016). 
The question to be studied in this article is: how important is data connectivity for the automotive industry in Brazil 
to make the transition to industry 4.0? Its objective is to analyze the investment capacity, and connectivity to the 
development of the supply chain in the automotive sector. 
The methodology used in this research is exploratory, qualitative and quantitative. To collect the primary data, 60 
questionnaires were addressed, through a survey, to the managers of the industrial area of companies in the automotive 
segment. The survey comprised 5 questions that addressed investment capacity, the importance of using industry-
related technologies 4.0 for automotive supply chain connectivity, and the gains and impediments related to 
connectivity. Answers were obtained from 51 questionnaires. 
From the surveyed sample 65% of the respondents belong to the auto parts segment, 25% from automakers and 10% 
metallurgical. 
Regarding investment capacity in the last two years, 73% of companies indicate that they have not made any 
investments, 25% large investments and 2% no investments. Over the next 5 years, 80% point to small investments, 
16% large investments and 4% of companies no investments. Noting that the major investments made and to be made 
refer to those of the automakers. 
Regarding the level of data connectivity between your company, suppliers, customers and partners 94% of companies 
indicate that the level is low, and only 6% consider it high. When asked what level of connectivity is appropriate, 84% 
indicate that it should be partial, 10% total, and 6% do not consider it necessary to establish connectivity. 
In the data analysis it was found that, for the Brazilian automotive industry, the level of investment made is still low, 
as well as the level of connectivity. For the next few years small investments are planned that can improve 
connectivity. 
Future research suggests deepening the theme in relation to investments and the need for business connectivity for the 
transition to industry 4.0.

Abstract  
 
Industry 4.0, an integral part of the fourth industrial revolution, is a technological trend that brings strong implications 
to industrial production worldwide. The transition to Industry 4.0 is shown to be inevitable, even if the results to be 
obtained are not yet widely known. Lean manufacturing's management philosophy, associated with Industry 4.0 
technological principles, can accelerate this process and minimize potential risks, thereby facilitating implementation 
solutions, even though the transition occurs gradually. The methodology applied for this research is exploratory, 
possessing both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Primary data were collected through a survey answered by 50 
managers from the automotive sector. Based on the obtained results, it was seen that companies have different levels 
of maturity regarding their digital transformation process. Although competitive advantages might be gained by such 
technological advancements, the surveyed companies did not show that competitiveness could be a differential, but 
recognizes that lean manufacturing can contribute to leverage the transition to Industry 4.0.

369",,"The Industry 4.0 concept considers the major technological innovations in the fields of automation, control and 
information technology applied to manufacturing processes (LEE ET AL. 2015). Being part of the fourth industrial 
revolution, it is a technological trend that brings reflexes to world production, based on the concept of physical cyber 
systems, internet of things, big data and cloud computing (SCHWAB, 2016). 
In an intelligent factory, the production process can promote real-time communication of workers, machines and 
inputs, allowing information to be obtained in real time (RODRIGUES, JESUS; SCHUTZER, 2016). The transition 
to Industry 4.0 is shown to be inevitable, even if the consequences for manufacturing operations are not yet widely 
known, which brings the need for companies to define their manufacturing model and plan their transformation 
program (ALMADA LOBO, 2016). 
Lean manufacturing's management philosophy, which applies Toyota Production System concepts, can leverage the 
transition to Industry 4.0. The combination of Industry 4.0 technologies and Lean concepts can accelerate this process 
and minimize potential risks, thus facilitating implementation solutions, even though the transition occurs gradually 
(KOLBERG; ZUHLKE, 2015). The Brazilian automotive chain is made up of a large number of manufacturers and 
is divided into four different segments: automakers, spare parts dealers, providers and importers (FERREIRA; 
MARTINS; MOREIRA, 2012).  
Considering the pillars of Industry 4.0, the competitiveness and companies’ requirements in the automotive segment, 
the questions to be studied in this research are: How does the auto parts industry in Brazil is being prepared for the 
transition to Industry 4.0? What are the impediments to this transition and what gains can be made? Aiming to identify 
the facilitators for this transition. 
The methodology applied for this research is exploratory, qualitative and quantitative. The primary data were collected 
through a survey system called survey answered by 50 industrial managers from the automotive industry. The research 
talked about the bottlenecks for using new technologies, the facilitators for the transition to industry 4.0 and the gains 
and impediments of this transition. The surveyed sample consisted of 70% of auto parts companies, 30% of 
automakers. 
The most cited bottlenecks were the lack of indicators to measure return on investment, connection between business 
chain participants and the availability of financial resources relative to Industry 4.0. The most cited impediments were 
lack of knowledge on the subject, lack of interest of the company and investments incompatible with available 
resources. Cost reduction, agility in production processes and availability of information were the most cited gains, 
while the competitive advantage was less pointed. As for the facilitators, 96% of the companies considered Lean 
important for the transition. 
Based on the obtained results, it can be seen that companies have different levels of maturity in relation to the 
transition. Although competitive advantages might be gained by such technological advancements, the surveyed 
companies did not show that competitiveness could be a differential, but recognizes that lean manufacturing can 
contribute to leverage the transition to Industry 4.0.

Abstract 
 
In this work is present a novel integer linear programming formulation to solve an operation planning 
problem in public transport systems. The proposed model is flexible, and it works by adding or removing 
specific constraints for the operation, depending on the laws of the corresponding country and the policies 
of a particular company. The formulation proposed in this work models a generic version of the Bus Driver 
Rostering Problem, which has a considerable amount of issues to be considered, mostly due to the 
complexity of the personnel management and their assignment of the daily duty. The main issues taken into 
account in the model are the specific work conditions, labor regulations for each country, companies’ 
internal policies and available staff. These are included as sets of hard constraints of the problem. In the 
literature, it was observed that there is a lack of general mathematical models representing this class of 
problems. Consequently, most of the published research related to this problem concern the development 
of heuristic solutions. Moreover, two-phase hybrid approaches combining heuristic and exact 
methodologies, for the first and second stage, respectively, are not able to ensure optimal solutions.  In this 
study, the model is tested on three different scenarios: (i) benchmark instances, (ii) newly proposed 
benchmark instances simulating the operation of a transport company varying the types of shifts and 
available staff, and (iii) real case of a public transport company of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in 
Colombia. Computational experiments show that a mixed integer programming (MIP) solver is capable of 
obtaining optimal solutions for each of the aforementioned scenarios in reasonable computing times.

Abstract  
 
The aim this qualitative research was to verify if the environment factor could be a new competitive priority in the 
Operations Strategy (OS), together with Cost, Delivery, Flexibility and Quality. The relationship between 
Environmental Management (EM) and OS in market-leading and ISO-14001 certified industrial companies was 
analyzed: Natura Cosmetics, Tilibra Stationery Products and Companies X and Y. The data were obtained from 
bibliographic research, semi-structured interviews, systematic observations and documentary consultation. The 
approach was deep enough to get yours results. The need to deal strategically with the environmental issue is not 
incorporated in OS theory. The exemplary companies studied indicate a path to success with any Generic Competitive 
Strategy (CS). The environmental factor has a strategic potential for competitive differentiation, it allows reducing 
costs (water, energy, etc.) and attending the stakeholders. Differentiation with a focus on the environmental factor 
allows greater profit margin, a support for unfeasible environmental measures from the perspective of Low Cost. The 
environmental factor can compose the OS as a qualifying factor for attend so the legislation, the market, and the 
customers. Thus, the environmental factor can/must be considered a new competitive priority for Operations; however, 
it must be combined with Sustainability and the Innovation.

1. Introduction 
There seems to be a consensus among researchers about the need to consider the treatment of environmental issues, 
within companies, as strategic. However, rare studies indicate the need to integrate this issue in the Operations Strategy 
(EO), which can occur considering it as a new competitive priority for Operations. (Jabbour et al. (2012). 
 
Thus, the question of this research is whether the environmental factor can be considered in EO as a new competitive 
priority and included along with the traditional ones - Cost, Delivery, Flexibility and Quality. The justification for this 
research question arose from the urgency in responding to the environmental question, coupled with its possible 
strategic potential for companies. This article portrays, then, the case studies carried out in the leading industrial 
companies in their markets and certified by ISO-14001 Natura Cosmetics Public Company, Tilibra Stationery 
Products and Companies X and Y, all with relevant participation in the environmental to different degree. It was 
worked a qualitative approach, considering that these companies can indicate an exemplary path for the competitive 
improvement of companies in general, and thus answering the research question.

374","leading companies in ISO-14001 certified. The framework that directed the research was the classic Operations 
Strategy model of Horte, Lindberg and Tunalv (1987). 
 
That objectives were met. The addressing environmental issues at the CS level, happens with the environmental factor 
understood as Sustainability (TBL). The unfolding of this Sustainability in the OS is due to the insertion in it of a new 
competitive priority of Operations: environmental factor. This result is in line with the various authors who put this 
need for companies actually place this factor at in the strategic level. Thus, significant advances are being made in the 
treatment of environmental demands, while Sustainability (TBL), by the companies Natura Cosmetics and Company 
Y. In these companies, the environmental factor is considered as a competitive priority, differentiation factor and 
winner of orders. In Company Y, the environment is placed composing the competitive priority Service, together with 
Innovation, involving its product and operations expanded in the plants of the client companies. Thus, there is a 
meeting of environmental demands being part of Sustainability (TBL), being present in the company's CS, composing 
the differentiation in broad market (Porter, 1991) or the customized service in select niches (Hayes et al., 2005). 
 
On the other hand, even working the environmental demands to meet the legislation, or to qualify towards to customers, 
markets or to meet guidelines of its headquarters, as it happens in the Tilibra and Company X, can still the 
environmental be placed in the Operations Strategy as one qualifying factor. In this case, the emphasis seems to be on 
the potential cost reduction present in the treatment of the environmental factor, through continuous improvement 
projects, reduction of input consumption, mainly water and energy, and the practice of the Porter and Van der Linde 
Hypothesis (1995), i.e., being it associated with Innovation. Even in these cases, environmental demands can also be 
placed at Competitive Strategy, be mentioned in the company's Mission, Vision and Values, and its Business Model. 
It should be noted that the status level in the hierarchy of the sector responsible for Environmental Management 
denotes the magnitude of the relationship between environmental impact and degree of importance given to the theme 
by the company. Thus, even though the environmental is treated as a qualifying factor, environmental demands can be 
considered at the company's strategic management level, and therefore also at its Operations Strategy. 
 
For companies adopting the Competitive Strategy lowest cost (Porter, 1991) or low cost / high volume (Hayes et al., 
2005) CS, the environmental factor can also make up the competitive priorities of Operations, being a qualifying 
element with customers and contribution to cost reduction. In this case, with the managing of the operations focused 
on reduce costs and increase productivity on all fronts, the environmental factor and its management meet only the 
legal and qualifying requirements of customers. However, it can compose the Strategies, Competitive and of 
Operations, achieving higher or lower status in the organization chart, but with the potential to contribute to the 
positioning, legitimacy and qualification of the company in its market. Thus, regardless of Competitive Strategy by 
Porter (1991) or Hayes et al. (2005), the environmental factor associated with Sustainability (TBL) and the Innovation 
has strategic potential for the company, justifying its inclusion in the Operations Strategy as a new competitive priority. 
However, it may have a (limited) cost reduction objective, combined with compliance with environmental and social 
legislation, and qualification next to the market and customers. Alternatively, it may have a higher goal of helping to 
leverage the company and differentiate it from competitors. 
 
Environmental demands must be present in companies' Competitive Strategy and Operations Strategy; and the 
environmental factor must be considered a new Competitive Priority of Operations, just as Environmental 
Management is one of Operations Strategy's decision areas. The main scientific argument that underlies the 
conclusions of this research is its qualitative character: it is not a matter of extrapolating the results from a probabilistic 
sample, but of verifying but of verifying advanced strategies and trends that companies can follow in order to obtain 
competitive advantage. In this way, they can be motivated to work the environmental factor at a strategic level, 
minimally by its qualifying character with the clients. The environmental factor and your management deserve 
strategic emphasis, to reduce harmful consequences of the environmental issue, and because of their potential to 
contribute to the maintenance, survival and growth of the company. As for competitive differentiation, when many 
companies are working at the strategic level, this factor may no longer be a differentiating. However, it will have 
continuity as a qualifying factor. Its association with innovation, transforming environmental challenges into business 
opportunities that are worked on in new ways, generating value for the customer, can maintain the potential of 
environmental treatment generating competitive differentiation.

Abstract 
 
In this work, a method based on the variable neighborhood search metaheuristic (VNS) is proposed to solve 
the integrated routing-packaging problem. The method considers three-dimensional packing constraints, 
heterogeneous fleet and environmental impact. Using the Split coding proposed by Prins (2004), the routes 
satisfying the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem’s capacity constraints are selected. The GRASP 
algorithm proposed by (Martínez et al., 2015) is used to validate the packing constraints of the Three-
Dimensional Single Knapsack Problem associated to the selected routes. Environmental impact is included 
in the optimization scheme, adding a fuel consumption term in the objective function. Additionally, a 
similar implementation that does not consider the fuel consumption was developed, in order to measure the 
impact of having a green vehicle routing approach. Computational results show that a mixed integer 
programming (MIP) solver is capable of obtaining optimal solutions for each of the aforementioned 
scenarios in reasonable computing times.

Abstract 
This study focused on the techno-economic assessment of sulphur gas removal from coal combustion, pyrolysis 
and gasification in the flue gas stream in order to reduce harmful emissions from the coal industry which causes 
adverse effects to the environment.  A potential of valorisation of the SO2 to valuable, sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is 
therefore analysed. The design of a 400 tpd H2SO4 production process utilizing sulphur from coal combustion and 
pyrolysis flue gases is proposed. Experiments conducted indicated a 2.12%.wt by mass of coal is the sulphur 
content in the flue gases. The modified Claus Process, Amine Process and the Contact Process were selected as the 
best processes for optimum H2SO4 production. Based on the mass balances, the calculated gas flow rate from the 
power station boilers which utilize an average of 6000 tpd of coal was 146.33 t/hr. Economic analysis showed that 
the production cost of a tonne of H2SO4 is USD 32.47 and the profit margin was USD 57.53, the return on 
investment (ROI) was 44%, with a payback period of 2.28 years and the breakeven point was 60 tpd indicating the 
viability of utilizing the recovered sulphur to produce H2SO4 both technically and economically.

1. Introduction 
In Zimbabwe majority of industries use coal as their major source of heat and in order to meet the Environmental Management 
Authority emission regulations many companies use scrubbers to remove sulphur from their fumes. Zimbabwe has an 
estimated total of 10.6 billion tons of coal in situ in 21 deposits.  Proven reserves can last for 107 years and total reserves over 
2000 years at the present production rate of 4.7 million tons per year. Thermal power generation is the prominent user of coal 
seconded by the manufacturing sector where coal is used for steam generation and smelting in furnaces. Coal is composed of 
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur with small amounts of other trace elements (Yelebe et al., 2013).  The sulphur 
present in coal is of two types: inorganic sulphur mainly present as pyrites and organic sulphur which forms the part of overall 
coal matrix (Karl et al., 2001). The oxides of sulphur (SOx) and of nitrogen (NOx) are the principal chemical pollutant 
products of coal combustion. When these gases are emitted by the power station stacks over half of the emissions fall to earth 
in dry form, relatively close to the source. In the presence of sunlight and other chemical oxidants present in the atmosphere, 
some of the remaining air-borne sulphur and nitrogen oxides are transformed into sulphites and nitrates and finally these 
sulphites and nitrates form H2SO4 and HNO3 resulting in acidic rain (Kapungwe et al., 2001). The only sulphide source mined

9. Conclusion 
From the analysis carried out it can be concluded that it is possible to produce 400 tpd of H2SO4 from sulphur recovered from 
coal combustion gas and coke oven gas. The operational considerations such as the process design and economic assessment 
were taken into account. The production cost of the H2SO4 is USD 32.58/tonne with a payback period of 2.28 years. The 
selling price is USD 90/tonne which is the current price of H2SO4.Thefore the H2SO4 production from coal combustion and 
coal pyrolysis process is technically and economically viable.

Abstract 
The control function is an important tool to monitor organisational performance of the operational 
plans. The control function is dynamic and can be used as an end function of an activity or for 
forward looking in planned activities. The control function is important in operational planning and 
decision making in mining organisations. Without the control function, mining organisations cannot 
monitor and evaluate the performance of their operational plans.  
Keywords: Control function, decision making, operational planning  
1. Introduction to Controlling 
The control function is very important for the successful operation of mining organisations. Controlling is the 
process of verifying whether everything occurs in conformities with the plans adopted, principles established 
and instructions issued. Controlling ensures that there is effective and efficient utilization of organizational 
resources so as to achieve the planned goals targets. Controlling measures the deviation of actual performance 
from the standard performance, discovers the causes of such deviations and helps in taking corrective actions. 
Controlling is a systematic exercise of checking actual performance against the standards and plans with a view 
to ensure adequate progress and also recording such experience as is gained as a contribution to possible future 
needs (Koontz et al., 1980). Controlling has two basic purposes which are facilitation of co-ordination and 
helping in planning. The characteristics of the control function of management include:  
i. 
Controlling as a pervasive function. Under this function, control is performed by managers at all levels 
and in all type of concerns. 
ii. 
Controlling as a dynamic process. Under this function controlling requires taking reviewed methods 
and changes have to be made wherever possible 
iii. 
Controlling as a forward looking technique. Effective control is not possible without the past being 
controlled. Controlling always looks to future so that follow-up can be made whenever required. 
iv. 
Controlling as an end function. This is the function which comes once the performances are made in 
conformities with plans. 
v. 
Controlling in relation with planning. Planning and Controlling are two inseparable functions of 
management. Without planning, controlling is a meaningless exercise and without controlling, planning 
is useless. Planning presumes controlling and controlling succeeds planning. 
2. Steps in the Control Process 
The 4 steps of the Control Process include:  
i. 
Establishing standards and methods for measuring performance 
ii. 
Measuring the performance 
iii. 
Determining whether performance matches the standard 
iv. 
Taking corrective action 
The steps are clearly indicated in Figure 1.

407","Problem diagnosis is the most critical and difficult step as the right problem must be identified. For example, if 
there is breakdown in the plant it is important to find out the root cause of the breakdown through trouble
shooting.  
Steps in Problem Diagnosis include: Finding out if there is a problem. Compare the results you have with the
results you wanted to achieve. Investigate what is wrong, find the reasons behind deviations from objectives.
Approach the problem analytically and realistically finding the distance between wanted and actual results,
barriers to success major deficiency factors and satisfactory solution requirements. Identify the constraints to the 
solution such as cost, personnel and information. Focus on the cause of the problem rather than deviations from 
defined standards such as employee turnover rate. Use symptoms to find the problem such as asking why the 
symptom exists - noticing the symptom of conflict between two departments and then determining why the
conflict exists. Determine the barriers to problem identification such as some managers thinking the cure is
worse than the disease, rationalizing decisions, postponing decisions or hating to make unpopular decisions.
Obtain available information and gather facts and information continually to identify the problem. Make a
thorough and comprehensive effort to identify all logical alternatives to the problem and encourage team
participation and brainstorming. Be flexible enough to deviate from the traditional way of doing things, to
include taking no action on the problem. Evaluation of each course of action and determine a set of attributes 
such as risk and schedule slippage, cost and resource utilization by which you will judge the alternatives.  
A poor decision can be made due to lack of alternatives from which to choose from because of the dynamic 
nature of the organization's environment, incomplete information, lack of time and risk (Williams, 2003). How a
decision is implemented will have a bearing upon its success and a plan of action should be created to announce 
the decision, to gather the resources to implement the decision and to assign responsibility to the individuals 
who carry out the implementation. It is important to keep in mind that people are more willing to participate in 
decision implementation if they have been given the opportunity to participate in the decision making, follow-up
and decision evaluation. In order to determine how accurate the decision was, it is critical to examine the results
over time and compare them to the desired results of the objectives.. 
8. Conclusion 
For mining organizations to thrive, there is need of the control function. Controlling ensures that the set targets 
during operational planning are met and adhered to. In addition, the control process helps in sound decision 
making resulting in effective and performing organizations.

411","Short-term plans are done at lower management levels and encompass a short period of time, such as plans for a
project. These plans are usually operational plans helping with day-to-day operations of the organisation.
Function plans can be developed for key organizational functions, such as engineering and each of these plans 
could be evaluated for potential conflicts between functional areas. 
The plans can address objectives, procedures, policies and methods (Marr, 2006). Objectives provide general
statements about the mission of the organization and are filtered down through the organizational hierarchy
where plans are created to achieve them. Policies are implemented to accomplish objectives and are general
guides to action. Procedures give the steps for accomplishing the policies such as standard operating procedures 
which show the set of steps e.g. in determination of the physico-chemical characteristics of a mineral. Methods 
are detailed plans showing the sequence of individual tasks to complete a specific assignment, such as how to 
complete a prototype design of a mineral processing plant. Plans succeed when they are monitored, used and
changed as work progresses but they can also fail if they are not kept up-to-date, realistic or clear in accordance
to the organisational strategy. 
6. Decision Making as Part of the Control Function 
Decision making involves the ability to collect, organize and synthesize information into a useful form for
identifying and evaluating alternate options. A well-known decision theorist, Herbert A. Simon (1962)
conceptualises three distinct phases in the decision making process. There are: 
1. Intelligence Activity – the military meaning of intelligence. Searching the   environment.  
2. Design Activity - Inventing, developing and analysing possible courses of action.  
3. Choice Activity – the third and final stage is the actual choice, selecting a particular    course of action. 
Decision making takes knowledge and puts it into action; i.e. it applies and uses knowledge. Another element of 
decision making is risk taking. For example, a decision without some risk is usually easy to make. A decision 
with risk requires the use of your judgment and good judgment is learned through practice and experience i.e.
oddly enough, probably in making bad decisions and learning from them. You can certainly discuss decisions 
with your team, other managers and mentors to help lower risk, but you must make the decision and help it to be 
a successful decision. As a manager, you can defer decision making, refuse to make a decision, make a decision 
quickly and reverse a decision. Your motive should be to do everything to help your team to get the job done 
effectively and efficiently. Many times, a decision will have to be made among vague and conflicting 
alternatives; i.e. complete information may not be available or may take too long to obtain.  
Decisions may be programmed or non-programmed. Programmed decisions recur and are predictable. Well-
defined procedures are used to make these decisions, such as production scheduling, following standard 
operating procedures, assigning shifts and inventory maintenance. Non-programmed decisions are addressed as 
they develop, are usually ill-defined and complex and have a large number of variables that may be less 
predictable or measurable. For example, non-programmed decisions may involve moving a theoretical result 
into a production system, determining which of two new commercial packages would work better in operational 
use, and helping a dysfunctional team work. Decisions have five characteristics: Futurity - how long will the 
decision commit the organization? If the commitment is quite long, then the decision should be moved up to 
higher levels. Reversibility - how fast can a decision be reversed and its consequences resolved? If the decision 
would be hard to reverse, it should be moved up to higher levels. Impact - are other areas or activities affected
by the decision? If the decision would have wide impact, it should be deferred to a higher level. Quality - are
social, human, ethical, and other values involved in the decision? If many qualitative factors are involved, move 
the decision to a higher level. Periodicity - how often is the decision made? Rare decisions should be made at 
higher levels. Decisions should be made at a high enough level where full consideration of all activities and 
objects affected by the decision can be given, but as close to the scene of action as possible. It may be helpful to 
look at the points where the decision can be made and where it should be made. If a large gap exists between the
points or an excessive number of people are involved, then possibly personalities and their preferences are
playing a major role (Karl, 1965). Watch out for traps that can derail a good decision making process. Bias in 
the information gathered, such as using only one person's point of view and selecting only favourable results.
Poor decisions can be made due to using only one interpretation of the information, creating similarities or 
differences where none exist - perceived rather than real, not communicating, sweeping failures under the rug 
instead of letting the past be used to empower the present and future, relying on the memories of people and
treating external departments like foreign powers as well as allowing a few individuals who have a need to be 
indispensable to hoard information that should be generally available to everyone. 
7. The Rationale Decision Making Process in Mining Organisations 
Decision making in mining organizations can be accomplished with the following steps when there is time and 
the decision requires analysis before it is made (Collier et al., 2006). What is the objective in making the
decision? What results are desired from making this decision? What is trying to be achieved? Objectives should 
be operational, practical and attainable. Statements of objectives should include constraints which can refer to 
how the objective will be attained, how resources are used and how conflicts with organizational goals are
avoided. Objectives should be ranked according to their importance, such as critical, desirable or good to have.

Abstract 
The situational leadership theory is becoming increasingly popular in modern organizational 
leadership especially in the mining sector. The most important task in situational leadership is being 
able to motivate the subordinates. A leader’s adaptableness is the important requirement for the 
success of the situational leadership model. The appropriateness of a leadership style changes with 
change in the leadership environment. The model highlights on using more than one style of 
leadership especially when developing subordinates. According to this model, there is a no best 
leadership style since the key factors of leadership is the adaptation to the job maturity and the 
proficiency level of the subordinates.

The situational theory of leadership is becoming popular in the framework of modern organizational leadership. 
A leadership style refers to the design of behaviour; including both action and words as validated by a leader or 
as observed by subordinates. Situational leadership revolves around job-related maturity. According to Mark et 
al (2009) job maturity refers to an individual’s ability in performing a job and this is a key factor determining a 
leader’s behaviour. The situational leadership model indicates that effective leadership is dependent on both the 
acts of management and leadership (Silverthorne, 2000). The model arose from the understanding that not all 
individuals within a team compare in terms of maturity level and that the need for a leadership style varies with 
situations. Thus the model is based on situational variables as it depends on day-to-day perceptions of a leader 
as well as the environmental observations. Efficiency of this model includes a leader’s valuation of the growth 
level of their subordinates as well as the situation at hand to adjust their leadership method accordingly (Essays 
UK, 2018). Situational leadership needs first understanding one’s principal leadership approach and the level of 
the follower’s development process. Situational leadership is principally becoming an effective strategy among 
mining organisations leaders and thus very vital in the challenging and complex mining environment. 
The situational theory of leadership proposes that no sole leadership style is finest. Instead, it all depends on the 
situation at hand and which type of leadership and strategies are best-suited to the task (Arvidsson et al., 2007). 
According to this theory, the most effective leaders are those that are able to adapt their style to the 
circumstances, task and nature of the team. The situational leadership theory is often referred to as the Hersey-
Blanchard Situational Leadership Theory.  
2. Hersey and Blanchard’s Situational Leadership Theory and Maturity Levels 
The Situational Leadership Model is a timeless, repeatable structure for leaders to match their behaviours with 
the performance needs of the individual or team that they are trying to influence. Situational leadership is based 
on the connection between leaders and subordinates and serves as a context to analyse each situation based on 
the performance willingness and the level that a follower displays in performing an exact task (Maxwell, 2009).

SLII proposes that effective leadership is dependent upon two key behaviors which are supporting and directing. 
Directing behaviors include giving specific directions and instructions and attempting to control the behavior of 
team members (Gilley et al., 2008). Supporting performances include actions such as encouraging subordinates, 
listening to them and offering acknowledgement and feedback. The theory identifies four basic leadership styles 
including: 
• 
Directing (S1): High on directing behaviors, low on supporting behaviors. 
• 
Coaching (S2): High on both directing and supporting behaviors. 
• 
Supporting (S3): Low on directing behavior and high on supporting behaviors. 
• 
Delegating (S4): Low on both directing and supporting behaviors. 
The main point of SLII theory is that not one of these four leadership styles is best. As an alternative, an 
effective leader will match his or her behavior to the developmental skill of each subordinate for the task at 
hand. 
5. Important Situational Factors for Consideration 
Experts suggest that there are four key contextual factors that leaders must be aware of when making an 
assessment of the situation in the mining sector (Abou-Moghli, 2015). These factors include: 
I. 
Leaders in the mining sector need to consider the relationship between the leaders and the members of 
the team. Societal and relational factors can play a role in determining which approach is best. A team 
that lacks effectiveness and productivity might benefit from a style that emphasizes order, rules and 
clearly defined roles. A self-motivated team of highly accomplished workers, on the other hand, might 
benefit from a more democratic style that allows team members to work self-sufficiently and have 
input in organizational resolutions. 
II. 
The level of power the leader has over team members should also be well-thought-out. Some leaders 
have power conversed by the position itself, such as the ability to hire, fire, reward or rebuke 
subordinates. Other leaders gain power over their relations with employees, often by gaining respect 
from them, proposing support to them and helping them feel counted in in the decision-making process. 
III. 
The leader wants to consider the task itself. Tasks can array from simple to difficult, but the leader 
needs to have a clear impression of exactly what the task involves in order to determine if it has been 
effectively and knowledgeably accomplished. 
As the Hersey-Blanchard model recommends, leaders need to study the level of maturity of each individual 
team member (Silverthorne and Wang, 2001). The maturity level is a measure of an individual's capability to 
complete a task, as well as his or her readiness to complete the task. Passing on a job to a member who is willing 
but lacks the ability is a recipe for disappointment. Being able to identify each employee's level of maturity 
allows the leader to choose the best leadership approach to help employees accomplish their goals.

415","The leadership style has a very influential effect on employee’s productivity, directly impacting organizational 
performance. Effective leadership style motivates employees to reach desired organizational goals, promoting 
good leadership that leads to an increase in employee’s productivity. It’s very critical for a firm to understand 
the relation between leadership style and employee’s productivity. It can be concluded that employees working 
in the mining sector are influenced by situational leadership behaviours of their managers.

Abstract: 
Thermal methods are the most used EOR methods. Thermal processes can reduce viscosity of heavy oil and residual 
oil saturation to improve mobility and achieve an economic recovery. Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) is one of the 
thermal methods, which has faster production, lower costs and lower pressure operations.  
The main objective of this paper is to find the optimum well location and injection parameters of the CSS process of 
two horizontal wells in sandstone reservoirs in order to increase the sweep efficiency and improve the production 
from this field. The field is one of heavy oil fields with low API of 17.7 and high oil viscosity of 3800 cp at 29o C. 
Optimum CSS parameters and several simulation models for different development scenarios have been built using 
an advanced thermal EOR simulator. Many scenarios have been conducted with different parameters and conditions, 
and compared to study the feasibility of applying CSS in horizontal wells. 
The designing model and prediction of future performance up to 2030 show that, implementation of CSS in two 
horizontal wells with optimum location and optimum CSS parameters can give additional 11.4 % recovery factor 
compared to cold 10 vertical wells. The final optimum result shows that oil recovery could be improved from 24.29 
% by 10 cold vertical wells to 35.7 % by CSS in the two horizontal wells.

Introduction  
EOR processes defined as “any process in which heat is introduced intentionally into a subsurface accumulation of 
organic compounds for the purpose of recovering fuels through well. Thermal enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) is one 
of the important types of EOR. CSI, CSS, also called Huff n’ Puff, is a thermal recovery method which involves 
periodical injection of steam with purpose of heating the reservoir near wellbore. One well is used as both injector 
and producer, and a cycle consisting of three stages; injection, soaking, and production. The cycle repeats to enhance 
the oil production rate.  
When enough amount of steam has been injected; the well is shut down and the steam is left to soak for some time 
not more than few days. This stage is called soaking stage, where the reservoirs heated by steam, consequently oil 
viscosity decreases. 
Since 1980, horizontal wells began capturing an ever-increasing share of hydrocarbon production. Horizontal wells 
offer the following advantages over those of vertical wells: 1. Large volume of the reservoir can be drained by each 
horizontal well, 2. Higher productions from thin pay zones, 3. Horizontal wells minimize water and gas zoning 
problems, 4. In high permeability reservoirs, where near-wellbore gas velocities are high in vertical wells, horizontal 
wells can be used to reduce near-wellbore velocities and turbulence, 5. In secondary and EOR applications, long 
horizontal injection wells provide higher injectivity rates, and 6. The length of the horizontal well can provide 
contact with multiple fractures and greatly improve productivity. (Ahmed T, 2010). 
Steam simulation of horizontal wells has been tested in many fields. Mendoza et al. (1997) has initiated steam 
stimulation of horizontal wells using two processes: conventional Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) and Single-Well 
Steam Circulation (SWSC). Horizontal wells typically yield higher primary recovery than vertical wells due to their 
larger contact area with the reservoir; with the use of steam as both heating and lifting agent, additional recovery is 
achieved. The well completion designs utilized conventional equipment to minimize costs and to focus efforts on the 
new stimulation processes with the use of standard completion. Preliminary results for SWCS in the Tia Juana field

426","Two horizontal wells have been tested for Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) to improve oil recovery using reservoir 
simulation modeling. From this study, horizontal well length and direction are strongly affecting the cumulative oil 
production. The optimum length of horizontal section for well -1005 and well-1003 are 420 m and 360 m in north-
east and north directions respectively. The optimum CSS parameters may vary according to the well location and 
reservoir heterogeneity. In this study; 230º C, and 330º C are the steam temperature; 250 M3/d, 200 M3/d are the 
steam injection rate; 28 days, 3 days are the injection period for well-1005 and well-1003 respectively. Simulation 
showed that the two wells have the same steam quality (80%), and soaking periods (3 days). From the results; the 
recovery factor can be increased by 47.5% using the two horizontal wells compared to 10 vertical cold wells, while 
the cumulative oil production has been increased by 27% with reduction of 2.3 % water cut. An economical 
evaluation is highly recommended for drilling the horizontal wells and CSS implementation.

Abstract 
 
The adoption of industry 4.0 concepts by companies is causing profound changes in all sectors, marked by the 
emergence of new business models, remodeling of production, consumption, transportation and delivery systems [11]. 
Society also expects the transformation of industrial production to achieve achievements in the three dimensions of 
sustainability, namely economic, environmental and social [8]. On the other hand, the adoption of industry 4.0 
concepts implies risks and challenges for society, such as job losses and changes in educational standards [9]. Although 
there is no consensus recommendation on the pace of industry 4.0 deployment, it seems peaceful that the production 
chain of the oil and gas industry is lagging behind in this process when compared to other industrial sectors [5]. 
Decision support systems have been the subject of active research by organizations for their development [6], while 
important measures have been widely used as decision support indicators, such as information and risk analysis [4]. 
Considering this demand, the present research seeks to evaluate how professionals of the oil and gas industry 
production chain rank the risks, based on the economic, social, environmental, technical and legal dimensions, when 
making the decision for the implementation of industry 4.0 concepts. From the risk model for industry 4.0 within the 
context of sustainability, developed by Birkel et al. [2], identified after bibliographic research and complemented by 
other authors [1,3,7,8,9,10,11,12], all consulted in the Scopus database, a Likert questionnaire was developed that 
allowed a qualitative assessment of the degree of relevance of each risk. In order to ensure the qualification and 
significance of the sample, the questionnaire was sent only to professionals from oil and parapetroleum companies 
with experience in technology and/or innovation. The use of the sampling strategy for convenience described resulted 
in 103 questionnaires answered, out of a universe of 536 requests for completion forwarded. The analysis methodology 
consisted of using descriptive statistics, comparing data between groups of respondents and conducting non-
parametric statistical tests, since the data subject to analysis were categorical, that is, nominal and ordinal. In this way, 
research in determining how deployment risks are hierarchical will serve as a decision support resource in 
management. The originality of the research lies in the possibility, analyzing the academic impact, of a new 
perspective of understanding the risks in the decision-making process for the implementation of industry 4.0 concepts 
within the oil and gas industry production chain.

Abstract 
 
This research aims to analyze critical factors to support information security and quality management systems 
integration, based on ISO 27001 and ISO 9001.The literature review raised factors such as: implantation model, human 
resources, resource availability, standards issues and standards integration.  In a qualitative research conducted with 
experts’ consultants, the theoretical factors were analyzed. It is important to understand the critical factors to ensure 
that managers allocate resources appropriately when implementing and maintaining an integrated certified 
management system.

1. Introduction 
 
The certified management systems implementation aims to continuously improve companies results, with 
professionalization and efficiency gains. The business success depends on satisfaction and overcoming of customer 
expectations in questions such as service quality, meeting the agreed terms, information´s reliability. Adequacy to 
certified systems makes processes more efficient, improves specifications and provides greater control. The process 
standardization and the definition of responsibilities make companies more organized, with less rework and waste, 
generating increased efficiency and quality of products and services (Maekawa et al. 2013). 
 
The ABNT NBR ISO 9001:2015 - Quality Management Systems (ABNT 2015) standard promotes the adoption of a 
process approach when developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, 
aiming to increase customer and stakeholder’s satisfaction, attending their requirements (Mesquida and Mas 2015). 
 
In a competitive world, only organizations that take advantage of the benefits that the best information can provide 
for decision making are able to prosper (Proença and Borbinha 2018, Gaspar and Popescu 2018, and Fomin et al. 
2008). With technological advances, access to privileged information can become a differential, so companies are 
subject to invasion by malicious people or organizations. The information leakage can damage companies’ reputation 
and competitiveness (Proença and Borbinha 2018; Tatiara et al. 2018, Rienzo et al. 2018, and Fazenda and Fagundes 
2015). 
 
The adequacy to ABNT NBR ISO/IEC 27001:2013 - Information Security Management Systems (ABNT 2013) 
standard allows organizations to conduct and effectively protect critical information, reflects the assessment of 
information processes, a proactive attitude of the company in relation to information security and shows that, in 
compliance with an international standard, the institution can be more trustworthy. In a competitive market, ISO 27001 
can be a differentiation point from competitors (Longras et al. 2018, Hsu et al. 2016, and Fomin et al. 2008). 
 
Several companies choose to implement more than one certified management system to guarantee the effectiveness 
and reliability of their processes. The need to have a global view of these systems, in order to align the objectives and 
facilitate decision making provokes the desire to integrate the systems (Mesquida et al. 2010). The integration of

Abstract 
 
The increase in the consumption of goods and services around the world has intensified the negative 
environmental impacts of industrial companies. Consequently, the concern with these impacts appears more and 
more on the international agenda, intensifying the pressure for companies to use sustainable solutions. One of the 
most used solutions since ‘90s is the Cleaner Production (CP) strategy. However, the CP study has only 
highlighted in the past ten years. Thus, it is important that governments, companies, and universities become 
aware of the importance of improvements in this area. The objective of this work is to identify in the literature the 
level of development of the Cleaner Production strategy through the analysis of its state of the art. To this end, a 
bibliometric study of the articles published during the last five and a half years (2014-08.2019) on the studied 
topic in the Scopus and Web of Science databases was carried out. The results show the main authors, countries, 
journals, keywords, and areas of study related to the CP literature. The study presented in this research enables 
new research on CP practices, encouraging its development. 
 
Keywords: Cleaner Production, State of Art, Bibliometric Study 
 
1. 
Introduction  
The growth of goods and services consumed in recent decades has resulted in increased generation of 
polluting waste around the planet. These increases negatively impact the environment more and more and, as a 
consequence, international concern about the environmental effects caused by industrial companies has also been 
growing (Kubota and Catorski, 2013). 
The intensification of concern by industrial companies pressures them to adopt management measures 
and minimize environmental impacts. Social pressures, market pressures, and pressures for international 
standardization make countries' environmental policies increasingly stringent, requiring companies to come up 
with sustainable initiatives (Yilmaz et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013). 
Thus, sustainable development is increasingly present in the strategic planning of corporations. This 
concern has generated improvements in the production processes of companies that adopt sustainable practices, 
creating competitive advantages (Gonçalves Filho et al., 2018).  
Sustainable development is conceptualized as development that meets current needs without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Its concept presents a relationship between 
human beings, the economy, and the environment, in which cultural, technological and economic development is 
oriented towards the maintenance of human life and preservation of the environment. This concept was presented 
in Brundtland's report by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987 (Khalili et al., 2015; 
Faé Gomes et al., 2013). 
Thus, the concept of sustainable development has become the basis for social and environmental changes 
of organizations and governments (Faé Gomes et al., 2013). The pursuit of sustainable development has promoted 
the creation of solutions aimed at reducing environmental impacts on industrial companies.  
Among the various solutions developed in this context, Cleaner Production (CP) is an important strategy 
that promotes sustainable development. Thus, applied by many industrial companies managers (Krolczyk et al., 
2017; Kubota and Catorski, 2013). CP aims to minimize the environmental impacts of companies' products and 
production processes using sustainable methods, resources, and technologies. CP promotes waste and operating 
costs reduction, more efficient processes, high-quality products, and improve the company's image to customers 
(Gonçalves Filho et al., 2018). 
Therefore, CP practices help managers to take actions that integrate environmental protection with the 
economic development of companies, consolidating the construction of sustainable societies (Almeida et al.,

432","the other themes, although some present a decrease, are relevant and deserving of attention from the scientific 
community. 
5. Conclusion 
The purpose of this article was to identify in the literature the level of development of CP, being a guide 
for further research on the theme. Thus, bibliometric analysis provided some findings about the state of the art of 
CP. The ten countries and authors most cited are the ones that most take initiatives in the development of CP. 
These countries' and authors' works can be references for new studies on the theme. The analysis of the journals 
indicated those that most concentrated the articles published on CP in the studied period. The Journal of Cleaner 
Production stood out for publishing more than 90% of these works being the reference journal for future research 
on the theme. 
At the same time, the analysis of keywords showed which are the main research topics in conjunction 
with the CP, and which are increasing or decreasing in importance. This analysis can be useful when choosing 
new research topics. 
 
The scientific contribution of this work was to identify the advances in the literature and to analyze the 
state of the art on the theme. The practical contribution consisted in the identification of possible aspects to be 
researched and explored on the theme in future works. 
The great novelty of this work was the bibliometric analysis on the theme, allowing the identification of 
the main countries, authors, newspapers, and keywords. Besides, the identification of keywords can be used as a 
guide for future researchers on which subjects related to CP should or should not be explored. 
As future research, the authors suggest the identification of the scientific gaps in the most cited articles 
on the theme. Thus, new strategies, practices, and methods for the rising keywords identified in this work can be 
developed.

Abstract 
 
The increase in life expectancy and the sharp drop in the fertility rate of the population over the last years have 
resulted in the rapid growth of the number of elderly people worldwide, and this reality is also perceived in countries 
such as Brazil.  In order to maintain the minimum housing standards of Long-Term Care Institutions for the Elderly 
(LTRIEs), there was a great impact perceived in work routines of the employees of these institutions, encouraging 
researches focused on the re-evaluation of the existent situations. The purpose of this article is to present the results 
of a research carried out in 2019, which, under the guidance of ergonomic science, applied the Ergonomic Work 
Analysis (EWA) at Lar Velhinhos de Zulma, located in the city of São José, Santa Catarina . Catarina, Brazil, with 
the objective of structuring the recommendations to improve the quality of life of workers in the laundry sector, 
supported by the application of research tools, such as REBA and Corlett Diagram.. The results of this investigation 
may contribute to the theoretical basis of other studies focused on the theme of the article and/or the application of 
the research tools in other contexts involving LTRIEs, or not. They might also help designers and specialists 
involved with the reality of LTRIEs to rethink the work environments that respect the psycho-physiological 
conditions of their employees.

employee in the ironing clothes 
activity (k) was the installation of a 
support platform for the feet (figure 
05).

This recommendation was forecast according to the orientations of the book of Ergonomic Verification Points (OIT, 
2018), which proposed actions to obtain positive effects without the need of sophisticated or high cost solutions. In 
this case, the platform is used to alter the position of the feet during the activity, avoiding that the employee stays in 
a static position during the whole period of work, a fact that may cause musculoskeletal problems and fatigue. 
 
The analysis of the activities in the Laundry sector of Lar Velhinhos de Zulma identified some risks that may affect 
the health of the employee in the long term, due to harmful situations in the carrying of loads and because of 
repetitive activities. The evaluation generated by REBA and by the Corlett diagram indicated the need for alterations 
in the work processes focused in this article, seeking for improvements that aim both the quality of life of the 
employees as well as the residents of the institution, in the issue related to noise. On the other hand, the analysis 
revealed that, even though a recent renovation had been done in the LTRIE, it was perceived that the objective was 
mainly the improvement focused on the resident and sanitary issues involved, once these constitute the main focus 
for this kind of institution to receive their business license. 
 
4. Conclusion  
 
In face of the results found in this article, it is believed that the objective of the research was attained, once they 
were presented in the process of investigation conducted in 2019, where, under the guidance of ergonomic science 
an Ergonomic Work Analysis (EWA) was performed in Lar Velhinhos de Zulma, in the city of São José. The entire 
process of raising data and analysis of harmful situations culminated in the most important recommendations in 
order to diminish or eliminate them, and by this, improving the quality of life of the employees of the laundry sector 
and of the LTRIE in general. The application of the research tools REBA and Corlett Diagram demonstrated to be 
compatible with the situations encountered, as well as the use of the dynamometer and sound level meter to verify 
the complaints related to the use of strength in the handling of the carts and the noise generated by these and by the 
other equipment of the laundry room, that caused harm to the employees of other sectors and affected the comfort of 
the elderly residents. 
 
The theoretical basis and methodological design demonstrated to be compatible and relevant to offer 
methodological-theoretical support, once this combination offers a contribution for the construction of knowledge 
within the area approached in the research, allowing other studies focused on the theme of the article and/or the 
application of the research tools in other contexts involving LTRIEs, or not. Also, they may help designers and 
specialists involved in the reality of LTRIEs, to plan and rethink the work environments with possibility of 
respecting the psychophysiological conditions of their employees. As a proposal for future studies, we suggest that 
the analysis conducted in this study be applied in other LTRIEs, aiming at not only the improvement in the laundry 
sector and its work activities, but also, on the improvement of the LTRIE as a whole, offering benefits for the 
employees and also for the residents.

Abstract 
 
Wind energy is an additional source of renewable energy, those energies that do not harm the environment and 
fits in the group of alternative energies. Brazil has one of the cleanest energy matrices in the world, mainly a 
matrix based on hydro power. The country is considered the most promising market for wind energy in Latin 
America, with an estimated wind potential of 300 GW. The research aimed to identify and define variables that 
most strongly impact the economic viability of operating equipment and wind farms in Northeast Brazil, 
identifying the key performance factors for the economic analysis performed, such as technologies, equipment 
size and productive efficiency. The study focused on wind turbines with installed capacity above 1MW, capable 
of generating power at more competitive costs. Deterministic models were used in the analysis of investment 
projects, which included the elaboration of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and the adoption of indicators such 
as Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return and Pay-back, complemented with a sensitivity analysis of the main 
variables impacting the economic viability of wind investments in Northeast Brazil. The cash flow analysis

5. Conclusion  
This research aimed to analyze the economic viability of wind generation in Northeast Brazil, as well as to define 
the variables that currently most strongly impact the viability of operating equipment and wind farms, identifying 
its key economic impact, such as technologies, equipment size and load factor among others. In this context, wind 
conditions, their intensity, direction, duration, and probability of occurrence was taken from surveys conducted 
by the Ceara State Secretariat of Infrastructure (SEINFRA) [25] published in the document ''Wind and Solar Atlas 
of Ceara State' provided for this research by the Ceara Federal University.  Information for this research was also 
obtained from technical reports published by ABEEOLICA, EPE (Energy Planning Company) of the Brazilian 
Ministry of Mines and Energy, as well as information regarding wind project financing conditions, provided by 
the Federation of Industries of the State of Ceara. Deterministic models were used in the analysis of investment 
projects, which included the elaboration of Cash Flows and the adoption of indicators such as Net Present Value, 
Internal Rate of Return and Pay-back, complemented with a sensitivity analysis of the main variables impacting 
the economic viability of wind investments in Northeast Brazil. The cash flow analysis allowed the calculation of 
the break-even for the different variables analyzed, equipment load factor, wind turbine investment and effective 
hours available for wind generation, among others. Although for the situation analyzed, wind generation projects 
in the Northeast of Brazil are economically viable, the profitability of these projects for the assumptions of the 
calculation assumed is still low, considering they generate a 15 years Pay-back and a return rate of 9.22% as 
opposed to an assumed financing cost of 7,3% p.a. (BNDES interest rates for the financing of larger wind

(due to the auctions practiced), risk in the wind equipment prices due to monetary exchange variations, and  even 
the existence of non-controllable variables such as wind intensity and duration. 
 
For the standard flow considered – Cash Flow 2 - for generation in Northeast Brazil the internal rate of return and 
the NPV are respectively of 9, 21% yearly (financing BNDES rate 7,3%) and the 454.136,80 USD (20-year project 
life span). The sensitivity of the variables 'interest rate', 'load factor', 'turbine investment’ and ‘tariff', the variables 
with the greatest impact on the Cash Flows analyzed, were calculated as shown in Table 2 to Table 5 for Brazilian 
wind projects. Among these, in the Brazilian case, the variable with the highest impact was the 'load factor' 
positively correlated with the NPV followed, in order, by the variables 'turbine investment' (negatively correlated), 
'tariff' (positively correlated) and 'interest rate' with negative correlation. We simulated the impact of depreciation 
on wind projects for Northeast Brazil with the following result: depreciation extended to the 20-year analysis 
horizon for standard Cash Flow results into an NPV of USD 457,395.63 and IRR of 9.22%; by applying a 5-year 
accelerated average depreciation for assets, NPV increases to USD 848,030.3 and IRR to 10.72% p.a. The research 
showed that profitability of wind generation projects can be improved, making these investments more attractive, 
through government action by a) reducing taxes on wind equipment and IRS rates and b) reducing the depreciation 
period of related equipment/assets and c) offering lower interest rates to finance wind generation projects.

Abstract  
 
Delivering high-quality services is crucial in service industry success. That is the reason why patient 
satisfaction in hospitals is an important research topic. Health services in developing countries are no 
exception, with high demand and significant budgetary restrictions. The widely accepted quality of service 
dimensions - tangibility, empathy, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance - have been studied to 
understand their impact on patient satisfaction; however, its application in every context is debatable, 
especially in circumstances where the patient cannot choose widely between different services. The military 
health care facilities in developing countries are one of those contexts; therefore, it is necessary to identify 
the specific dimensions of a quality service that contributes to patient satisfaction in them. This study aims 
to reveal factors associated with patient satisfaction that may be useful for military organizations in 
developing countries. To meet the objective of the study, the authors collected surveys of 2,606 users of 
military health care facilities. The analysis was performed in two phases.  First, confirmatory factor analysis 
is carried out to validate the goodness of the proposed measurement model. Second, the effects of the 
variables of the measurement model on an overall satisfaction variable are analyzed. For the first phase, a 
structural equation model analysis based on covariance (CB-SEM) is used, and for the second phase, a 
structural equation model based on variance (PLS-SEM) is applied.  In total, seven indicators are included 
in the measurement model. The results of CB-SEM propose that the data are adjusted to three components, 
namely: appointment scheduling service, human resources quality, and medical support services. Regards 
the global adjusted of the model, the quality measures of the exact fit show that the Chi2 statistic is 
significant (92.0, df = 11, p-value < .001), and all indexes show a satisfactory fit. The values of GFI (.986), 
TLI (.974),  and RMSEA (.054) are satisfactory (their values tend to 1 and > .5); additionally, the index 
SRMR (.025) indicates the acceptable fit (<.08). The analysis with PLS-SEM indicates the 
constructs measurement reliability  (all composite reliabilities > .8) as well as convergent validity (all AVE 
> .5) and discriminant validity (HTMT < .9 for all relationships between variables).  Moreover, the result 
of the analysis of the structural model indicates that the three latent variables of the model explain the 
variance of the overall satisfaction (R2 = .34); the path coefficients for appointment scheduling service, 
human resources quality, and medical support services are .13, .40, and .15, respectively. A bootstrapping 
procedure indicated that all these effects are significant (p-values < .001). In conclusion, on the one hand, 
these findings highlight the assessment of the patient concerning the human dimensions in military health

that explain the overall satisfaction of the patient in this context.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper was to identify through a systematic literature review the relevant supplier development 
(SD) practices and the supplier evolution concept in the last three decades. The literature review identified the relevant 
SD concepts, which figure out a proposed conceptual framework to depict the supplier development process in a 
holistic way, and its expanded version aims to help organizational managers develop their strategic suppliers. The 
method used was a systematic literature review ranged from 01/01/1999 until 30/06/2018. The obtained results show 
us that the supplier's development concepts presented an evolutionary process over time, undergoing a paradigm shift 
from a transaction-oriented way to a relation-oriented relationship. The proposed expanded framework resulting from 
this work aims to favor managers to direct their suppliers' practices better. The analysis of the results obtained indicates 
that the purchasing companies and their suppliers need to intensify the long-term relationships between them to face 
the challenges promoted by the intense use of new technologies induced by IIoT.

1. Introduction 
Manufacturing organizations face a huge challenge and are at an inflection point due novel technologies in their 
operational systems. Accordingly, Koren (2010), the operating companies' environmental is subjected to extreme 
pressures, which varied over time. The significant volatility promoted by a massive use of new technologies requires 
different competition levels, and one of them has been occurring within the supplier base of these companies. In order 
to become more responsive to the environmental threats, companies, according to Krause, Handfield and Scannell 
(1998a), have been promoting a reduction of their hierarchical organizational levels and, at the same time, seeking to 
concentrate on their central businesses, promoting the outsourcing of their no core processes and products/services. 
These strategic movements promoted greater dependence of the purchasing companies on their suppliers, requiring

research is expected to put in practice the expanded framework by the organizational managers.

Abstract 
An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a comprehensive packaged software solution composed 
of several configurable modules that integrate, firmly and in one single system, the core business activities 
through the automatization of information flows and the use of a shared database. In the process of 
integration of the packaged are incorporated the best practices, to facilitate the decision making, to reduce 
costs and to improve the directive control, and eventually, to reach the efficient and effective use of the 
enterprise resources.  The scientific interest in ERP systems began around the year 2000, and since then, 
several authors have proposed research agendas associated with this technology; however, as far as we 
know,  there is not an analysis of the evolution of these agendas. In this context, this study aims to explore 
the research topics in ERP systems and determine trends associated with them.  This study uses data 
extracted from articles published between 2002 and 2019 in information system journals incorporated in 
WoS. The total number of studies for this exploration was 231; all of them contain “Enterprise Resource 
Planning” in their title or abstract.  The research consisted of three steps that included, first, preprocessing 
of titles and abstracts, second, determination of topics with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and third, 
trend analysis. The preprocessing involved tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. LDA is a topic 
modeling method, unsupervised and probabilistic, that extracts topics from a document collection. LDA 
analyzes the words in each document and calculates the joint probability distribution between the words 
observed and the hidden structure unobserved of the topics. This study identified a local minimum of 
perplexity (= 246.8) with a classification in 18 topics. This number of topics is near to the number of topics 
indicated in the ERP research agendas.  In order to analyze the research trends, a model based on five topics 
was used  (perplexity = 376.4). This choice is the result of the revision of the models of 2 to 18 topics. In 
the case of topic1, the five most frequent tokens are implement*, enterpris*, culture*, assimil*, and 
technolog*; consequently, it is labeled cultura&implementation. For topic2, the five most frequent tokens 
are implement*, firm*, enterpris*, technolog*, and organ*; therefore, it is labeled implementation. The five 
most frequent tokens for topic3 are cloud*, trust*, cost*,  profit*, and vendor*; thus, it is labeled markets. 
In the case of topic4, the five most frequent tokens are user*, enterpris*, perceive*, satisfact*, and train;  
accordingly, it is labeled users. Finally, the five most frequent tokens for topic5 are busi*, enterpris*, 
company, integr*, and oper*; therefore, it is labeled operation.  Lastly, the trend analysis indicates that the 
studies on users and markets are on the increase, and on the other hand, those on implementation and 
operation decrease. The conclusions of the study indicate that there is a trend in ERP research, which leaves 
behind technical elements associated with implementation and operation and focuses on socio-
technological issues. Since this study is an exploration, the findings should be taken carefully.

Abstract  
 
With the rise of access to mobile internet and the reduced cost for service over the last years, streaming 
services have replaced the way people access music over the internet. Music is an integral part of most 
peoples, lives, with a global average of 2.5 hours a day spent listening to music. Of these total 17.8 average 
hours a week, 86% of the music consumption is by streaming music.  As the IPFI Global Music Report 
explains, streaming services accounted for less than US$0.1 billion of the global music industry revenue in 
2005; this is in contrast with 2018, where this industry accounts for US$8.9 billion, accounting for 47% of 
the industry’s revenues, with paid services being a 37% and ad-supported streams a 10% of the total 
revenue.  In this context, this study examines the applicability of a model based on the hedonic information 
system framework to music streaming acceptance in Brazil. This framework is an extension of the 
Technology Acceptance Model to a hedonic context. An online survey based on scales of individual 
acceptance variables was used to measure the acceptance of Spotify by a sample of 51 Brazilian users.  The 
partial least squares (PLS) technique was used to analyze the measurement and structural model. The scales 
translated into Portuguese were based on studies previous. All the items were quantified using a 7-point 
Likert-type scale. The research model considers four variables, perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived 
usefulness (PU), perceived enjoyment (PE), and behavioral intention (BI). The model proposes that BI is 
explained by the other variables; besides, PEOU explains both PU and PE. The reliability and validity of 
the measurement models were computed taking into account the recommendations of the literature. The 
latent variable discriminant validity was confirmed using the Fornell–Larcker test and the Heterotrait–
Monotrait test. Also, the SRMR of .9 confirming the consistency of the general estimated model. After the 
PLS estimation, a bootstrapping procedure was performed. Bootstrapping is a nonparametric procedure that 
permits testing the statistical significance of  PLS results. PEOU affects both PU and PE; the relationship 
PEOU->PU has a beta of .536 (p-value <.001), and the relationship PEOU->PE has a beta of .649 (p-value 
< .001).  Nevertheless,  BI is only affected by PEOU; the relationship PEOU->BI has a beta of .367 (p-
value = .015), the relationship PU->BI has a beta of .221 (p-value = .134), and the relationship PE->BI has 
a beta of .108 (p-value = .511). In short, the structural results indicated that the model poorly explains the 
behavioral intention in the adoption of music streaming in Brazil. Specifically, 35.4% of the variable 
behavioral intention is explained by the variable perceived ease of use; the variables perceived enjoyment 
and perceived usefulness have not significant effect on behavioral intention.  In conclusion, this study is 
not enabled to support that the hedonic information system framework is applicable to music streaming 
acceptance in Brazil.

Abstract 
The circular value network is based on the cyclic integration of the flows of materials, information, finances, 
knowledge and innovation of the actors that compose it. The purpose of this work is to analyze the perspectives of 
circular value networks in Ecuador, from their principles and limitations. In addition, measures are proposed to 
increase the application of this concept in the country. A three-stage methodology was developed to map, diagnose 
and analyze the circular economy approach in the network through three checklists. As a result, limitations were 
identified for good practices; which focus on traditional business models, lack of ecological culture and few 
incentives in public policies. In addition, due to the high volume and variety of raw materials handled by the chains 
studied, its participants do not consider reuse or recycling to be an imperative necessity. The theoretical contribution 
of this research is the contextualization of the trend of the circular economy in the country; and from the 
methodological point of view; the definition of tools for its application in current contexts.

The three integral indicators that are evaluated in the value network have low values (Figure 6). The most affected 
variables focus on innovation, information management and product design. In addition, the need to focus on 
knowledge development is highlighted; this due to the low education and training in these matters. 
  
 
Figure 5: Comparison of the three general indicators. 
Some of the actions that would contribute to the development of the circular economy in Ecuador in general: 
 Develop public policies that favor tax incentives for investment and decrease taxes for the use of good practices 
in the circular economy. 
 Design products that, due to their recycling nature, have some benefit for the consumer, and the stakeholders 
that use them. 
 Define information campaigns to raise consumer awareness of the need to recycle, reuse and reduce the 
consumption of products and services. 
 Develop circular cities with the determination of their integral public processes and their coordinated flows that 
guarantee the principles of the circular economy. 
 Establish in the curricula of undergraduate and postgraduate careers the circular approach. 
 Plan together, at all levels involved the necessary actions for the migration of a linear economy to a circular 
one. 
 Design products and services with added value for the new business models. 
 Promote the application of circular value networks for the change of the productive matrix and greater social 
benefits. 
 Promote technological transfer to enterprises and communities where raw material is available. 
 
4. Conclusions 
At present, philosophies aimed at the circular economy and its management in the value network is a key factor 
when it comes to improving the competitiveness of any chain and the actors that compose it. In this investigation the 
practical presence of this approach in Ecuador was analyzed; through a holistic study with three diagnostic tools in 
an agro-food chain. The adoption of the best practices to the agro-food sector will be a key factor that will contribute 
to increasing the levels of innovation, information management and design of value-added products. This change 
should present as a basis the training of personnel in basic skills for the execution of this philosophy in business 
practice. In future research, we propose to continue the study of the circular economy and promote the development 
of a tool that evaluates the network of circular value through comprehensive indicators.

Abstract 
 
Women are often under-represented in academic and professional fields of engineering and natural 
sciences. Retaining and strengthening them in these postgraduate programs is one of the most effective 
measures for promoting gender equality in the field. However, there is a lack of studies defining and 
analyzing the profiles and needs of these women. In 2018, we collected data about 916 women at the best 
university of South America, through an official request of information followed by an online survey. The 
results show they are between 21 and 30 years old, single, do not have children, and are strongly dependent 
on their scholarship income. The desire to become a professor/scientist motivated them to enter the 
program. The campus of their postgraduate program is not the same where they did their graduations, and 
their families do not live in the same town of their campus. One-third of them declared they want to have 
children in the medium-term. It is surprising that 65.12% refused to answer questions about their social 
status as postgraduate students, despite being informed that the survey was anonymous. This may indicate 
that being a woman doing a postgraduate program in engineering or sciences is a taboo in Brazil.

1. Introduction 
 
The theme of gender equality and women empowerment grew in popularity after the United Nations Organization 
established it as one of the eight Millennium Development Goals (United Nations, 2020). Despite some governmental 
(Government of Canada, 2020) and organizational (IEEE, 2020) efforts, women are often under-represented in 
academic and professional fields of engineering and natural sciences (MentorNet, 2003). Particularly, women who 
undertake a postgraduate program are expected to become professionals who will mentor future students. Mentoring

neutral in attribution) and CAPES/CNPq was USD 6,082.47 (for 78.56% of them).  
 
They desire to become a professor or a researcher motivated them to start a postgraduate program. The majority of 
them desires to follow the academic career exclusively and one third declared they want to have children in 5-year 
term. The women also do their postgraduate studies in a town different from where they did their graduate studies and 
do not have family in the same town of the campus. It may be assumed that it is essential to have access to daycare 
centers to achieve a full professional performance. This is also supported by the answers of open question, daycare 
center, psychological assistance, and professional coach. 
 
When asked about social status and acceptance of being a woman in a postgraduate program (question 13, 14, 15, 16, 
and 17), 65.12% of the women refused to answer, despite being informed that the survey would be entirely anonymous 
since the first question. This may indicate an error in methodology or that being a woman doing a postgraduate 
program is a taboo in Brazilian society, at least, in Engineering and Natural Sciences.

Abstract 
 
The advent of digital technologies enabled new Product Service Systems (PSSs) grounded by digital 
capabilities, i.e. digital PSS. Although the literature has already begun to explore some cases of PSS 
offerings supported by digital technologies, it remains a considerable gap about the role of digital ca-
pabilities in new PSS solutions provided by product firms. In this context, the purpose of this study is to 
answer the important question: how digital capabilities support different types of PSSs? Following 
Cusumano’s et al. (2014) division of PSS offerings according to the role of service, i.e. smoothing, adapting 
and substituting, we conducted interviews in Brazilian companies representing these types of PSS. These 
cases were selected because the PSS offerings were supported by digital technologies. Our findings show 
that the digital capabilities can have different implications in PSS and that their im-portance variates 
according to the role of services in adding value to the digital PSS offering. Particular-ly, product 
monitoring digital capabilities were highlighted as relevant for all types of PSSs, while optimization and 
autonomy digital capabilities were stated as important only to higher value-added offers.

515",,"user identification and remote connectivity and control were not considered important to the PSS with product 
orientation and with little interaction with the customer. The geolocation capability was important to the substituting 
services offering, where the location also affects how the company bill its customers, according to the product usage 
and its performance. 
According to our findings, companies usually develop the technologies internally or buy from the supplier. However, 
there are factors as the lack of resources to develop specific projects or the need of adaptation to international protocols 
that motivate companies to make new partnerships. Therefore, this study provides empirical data which complements 
the servitization literature, with insights about the engagement of suppliers of digital technologies, as is commonly 
recommended for tradicional PSS (Ayala et al. 2019). Once few studies approach the digital technologies contribution 
to PSS offerings (e.g. Dalenogare et al. 2019; Frank et al. 2019), and all of the existent literature has the focus of 
internal solutions developed by the companies, not considering supplier-customer engagement.  
 
6.2 Limitations and future researches 
The main limitation of this study is the reduced number of case studies and interviewees. Therefore, we recommend 
for future researches to increase the sample in order to make comparisons between the perceived importance of the 
digital capabilities the companies have and the ones they need to obtain, especially with the collaboration of suppliers. 
This is important to understand how the essential digital capabilities could be developed with the engagement of 
partners, likewise the possible arrangements of collaborations, in order to successfully develop a digital PSS. Also, 
relevant aspects of innovation policy criteria (Frank et al. 2018) for the utilization of smart products, such as smart 
meters, for increasing efficiency on energy consumption should have discussion. Lastly, considering that most studies 
has a qualitative approach, it would also be interesting to develop quantitative studies, in order to statistically 
investigate the relationship between digital capabilities and the collaboration in the performances of the companies.

Abstract 
 
Industry 4.0 is already a reality in the industrial environment, even though it is not fully applied. The objective of this 
study is to raise the necessary requirements for the implementation process of Industry 4.0 in the context of heavy 
automotive manufacture. For this, the study was developed through a literature review on the subject Industry 4.0, a 
survey of the requirements of the heavy automotive industry and its prioritization, based on the relationship with 
technologies associated to Industry 4.0, using an approach adapted from the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) 
tool. The manufacturing requirements were validated with specialists from the automotive industry who also 
contributed to their prioritization regarding their degree of importance. The results show that some technologies of 
Industry 4.0 presented a much higher degree of prioritization related to the others, being mandatory for a 
manufacturing project. Thus, the present work can contribute to practitioners unfolding the principles of Industry 4.0 
in manufacturing requirements, which can be used in the design of new heavy automotive assembly lines and, in 
addition, the findings contribute to the literature on Industry 4.0 filling extant theoretical gaps.

Conclusions 
 
The present study contributes to deepening the research in the area of Industry 4.0, applied to the automotive industry, 
since the subject is new and the available literature is still scarce with few cases of practical application of technologies 
in this type of industry. From a practical point of view, it was possible to demonstrate that the adaptation of the QFD 
tool, can be used for strategic prioritization of Industry 4.0 technologies, according to its requirements, in a very easy 
and fast way. The use of this tool can be extended to other industries, as long as the requirements are known and 
classified in order of importance. 
As limitations of this work, the facts of having been carried out within the scope of the automotive industry are 
disregarded, therefore subject to its particularities. Still, a single case study was carried out, in a company whose 
knowledge about the technologies, their difficulties and even the costs of implementation are still little known. As 
opportunities for future studies, the tool can be applied in other case studies to consolidate its use. In addition, it is 
important to deepen studies regarding the costs and difficulties of implementing Industry 4.0, including technology 
and service providers as sources of knowledge (Paslauski et al., 2016, 2017).

Abstract 
 
Retail e-commerce (B2C - business-to-customer) grows more in developing markets than in developed ones, however, 
most studies in the area were aimed at developed markets. This thesis aimed to compare the relative efficiency of 
publicly traded companies that operate in the retail of physical products online in a developed market (Canada) and 
another in development (Brazil), separately, and to discuss the practices of each market. To this end, a new 
instrumental approach was proposed, based on an integrated model of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Optimal 
Control Theory (OCT) to measure the efficiency of total inventory costs, based on the theory lean management, 
integrating the concept of capacity efficiency (i.e., management of physical assets). Also, the model directly 
incorporated inflation and, indirectly, the gross margin. The model was applied to public data from two sets of 
companies classified as Retail (Var) or Non-Durable Clothing and Consumer Goods (VBCnD) - one composed of 12 
Canadian companies (CA) and another by 17 Brazilian companies (BR) -, during the period from 2016 to 2019. Then, 
a qualitative analysis of the B2C of the companies was made. The results showed that, in both countries, Var 
companies were more efficient than VBCnD. There are indications that BR companies were at a more advanced stage 
of the digital transition. In Brazil, Var companies prioritized sales by app and marketplace (own or third parties) and 
VBCnD companies, by app and virtual store. In Canada, Var companies have prioritized virtual stores and apps, while 
VBCnD, marketplaces (third parties), and apps. Although it is a common practice for BR Var companies, no observed 
CA company controls a marketplace. In Brazil, there was a strategy in which two companies operated in parallel, one 
specialized in B2C and the other in physical retail, though they were not more efficient than the market. The results 
pointed to BR companies Magazine Luiza, Arezzo, Estrela, and Via Varejo as market benchmarks, so their best 
practices should be studied.

Abstract 
 
The cutting stock problem is a classic problem of combinatorial optimization. However, the variant of the 
problem with two-dimensional irregular items has been scarcely explored. In this problem, the items have 
a free shape and must be located within a set of identical sheets with fixed dimensions. The main objective 
is to minimize waste, which is the same as reducing the number of bins where a specific demand for objects 
can fit. In this work, the items can be rotated freely and be placed without a fixed orientation; this allows 
the solution of this problem to be more consistent with the different applications in the industry where it 
appears.  
 
The literature proposes classical techniques of column generation and metaheuristics. However, integrate 
column generation procedure and simulation environment using the Unity engine is novel. 
The methodology considers a column generation procedure to select the subset of sheets composing the 
solution.  An auxiliary problem will create each of the proposed bins to be given to the master problem as 
columns. Through a two-phase construction procedure, the slave problem is solved. With the Unity engine, 
a local search with exchange and insertion operators is implemented. 
The proposed technique was validated with instances from the literature of cutting stock problem. New 
best-known solutions were obtained for three different test cases. Compared to previous works, the 
computing time is satisfactory and reasonable. In general terms, the methodology presents successful

Abstract 
Companies still concern about the impacts of the technologies of industry 4.0 in business processes. Hence, researchers 
are trying to develop studies to improve the understanding related to new techniques, frameworks, and concepts in 
order to support the implementation of industry 4.0. The aim of this paper is to perform a science mapping in the area 
of process modelling for industry 4.0 in order to get a holistic observation through the evolution structure of the field 
of study, pointing the main challenges, trends and suggestions for future works. To perform this science mapping, the 
SciMAT was used. Moreover, the VOSviewer was used to analyze co-authorship between authors. The scientific 
evolution presented 17 clusters in which the most representative themes are: 'design', 'framework' and ‘cloud 
computing’. Besides, the intellectual structure of motor themes is presented as well as the main challenges, trends and 
suggestions for future researches.

Abstract 
 
Industry 4.0 is characterized by the use of several technologies used individually or interconnected, this model 
contributes to process optimization and waste reduction. Within the manufacturing industry, the Brazilian textile and 
clothing industry stands out for its high employability rate and for being the largest integrated production chain in the 
West, from the production of fibers, such as cotton plantation, to fashion shows (ABIT, 2018). In Brazil, the textile 
industry is disseminated throughout its territory with a high concentration in the state of Santa Catarina, standing out 
as a textile pole. Based on this, this multi-case study aims to explain and compare the results of applying the 
questionnaire regarding the use of technologies from industry 4.0 in four textile industries in the region of the State of 
Santa Catarina. The most used technologies in companies are cyber security, big data, systems integration and internet 
of things (IoT), the last three being considered more relevant to the industry, in addition to simulation, according to 
the research result. Investment in new technologies, lack of qualified labor, change to a New Business Model and 
standardization, were listed as main barriers for the implementation of industry 4.0.

 1. Introduction  
 
According to the National Confederation of Industry - (CNI, 2016a), in the medium and long term, 
the incorporation of new technologies in a strategy for the development of Brazilian industry will 
be essential for the country's competitiveness and to improve its participation in global value 
chains. Therefore, the applicability of industry 4.0 technologies is increasingly on the rise in Brazil. 
According to a survey conducted by CNI (2018), among the large Brazilian industrial companies, 
73% are in Industry 4.0, although in the initial stage of implementing the technologies, these 
technologies, presented by Rübmann et al. (2015) and illustrated through figure 1.

It is observed that the investment in new technologies is the biggest challenge identified, representing 75% of the total 
of the studied companies, in addition, the lack of qualified labor, change of business model and standardize in the 
industry model 4.0, are considered relevant challenges by 50% of companies. 
 
Seven of the eight challenges were mentioned by the interviewees, with the exception of the regulatory framework. 
Framework translation is structure and is defined by Cotter and Potel (1995) as an extensible set of object-oriented 
classes that are integrated to perform well-defined sets of computational behavior. 
 
5. Final considerations 
 
This article described the result of a multi-case study in textile industries in the Santa Catarina Region, in order to 
identify the technologies of industry 4.0 currently used and the challenges encountered in their implementation. 
 
Based on the results explained, companies A and B are the ones that most use the technologies of industry 4.0, both 
have six of the nine technologies. 
 
The technologies present in all companies are cyber security, systems integration, big data and IoT, cyber security 
being the most used. However, additive manufacturing technology is not used in any of the companies as a result of 
the research. 
 
Investment in new technologies was considered the greatest challenge for the implementation of industry 4.0, CNI 
(2018) states that technical factors, that is, technology, labor and raw materials, also positively affected the decision 
to invest. 
 
In three of the four companies, in addition to applying the questionnaire, it was possible to visit the industrial parks 
and monitor in person the use of the technologies covered in the research. However, it can be concluded that the textile 
companies in the Santa Catarina textile pole are taking use industry 4.0 technologies to remain competitive in the 
market and increase your productivity.

Abstract  
 
The effective selective collection of urban solid waste in a city is fundamentally due to the positive behavior 
of individuals from that society. Therefore, the aims of this study was to propose steps to maximize 
engagement in relation to participation in the system of selective collection by Federal District’s population. 
In order to achieve this goal, it is important to know the variables that lead to this type of behavior, given 
that the human being is subject to several factors that influence him. Thus, a method of structural equations 
was applied, using SmartPLS (Smart Partial Least Square), through a quantitative exploratory research. A 
questionnaire was applied to 120 people from the Federal District. As a result of this research, a validated 
and reliable model, with a composed reliability indicator of 0,895, that explains Behavior by 47,2% was 
obtained. The variable that most contributed to the prediction of waste separation behavior was the 
Perceived Behavioral Control, responsible for 27,8% contribution to the explained variance of the 
endogenous variable. Finally, a Behavioral Mobilization Strategy was proposed, integrating the pillars of 
awareness, strategic facilitation and transparency into an action plan that is the basis for the development 
of pro-environmental behavior.

Abstract  
 
A voltage dip (or sag) is a sudden reduction in the supply voltage on one or more phases to a value between 90% and 
1% of the reference voltage followed by a voltage recovery shortly afterward. In recent years, interruptions, or failures 
in manufacturing processes due to the poor quality of energy supplied have attracted the interest of industrial 
consumers, mainly because these events represent significant financial losses to the industrial sector.  The failure of 
some equipment can lead to a partial or total shutdown of the production chain. In this context, this paper shows a 
study of the case of a supervisory system that can estimate the process immunity time (PIT) of a machine. The 
estimation process considers PIT values of each equipment that participates in the operational control of the machine, 
their supportability curves to voltage sags, and their respective connections (serial, parallel, etc.). The results show 
that the supervisory system is a useful tool to assist planners during decision-making to reduce operating costs.

Voltage sags, Industrial Processes, Industry 4.0.  
 
1. Introduction 
Currently, electric energy brings convenience, comfort, and safety for users (residential, commercial, industrial 
customers). However, interruptions of power supply or when it is supplied with a poor power quality can lead to 
interruption of manufacturing processes (Cunha & Silva 2003; Hu et al. 2020).  
Voltage sag has received more attention at the industrial and commercial facilities because of the malfunctioning 
of various sensitive equipment, which leads to finance-related issues. According to statistical data, the occurrence of 
voltage sag is more frequent than other power quality issues (Arias-Guzman et al. 2015; Behera, Banik, & Goswami 
2020; Polat, Selim, Yumak, Gul, & Unal 2018). This an important aspect that must be considered so that the industrial 
sector feels more confident to invest in Industry 4.0. 
According to Bollen (2000), electric disturbances are characterized according to their intensities and durations. 
For example, short-duration voltage variations are defined as a precarious voltage level (sag or swell) during a short 
period of time (milliseconds). These types of events can cause unintentional failures in electronic devices (also called 
equipment disruptions or equipment trips) that control industrial processes. In this way, voltage sags and power 
interruptions are usually the result of faults in the network and switching actions to isolate the faulted sections. In 
IEEE (1995), voltage sags are defined as a reduction in RMS voltage magnitude between 10% and 90% of nominal 
voltage during 0.5 cycles up to 1 min caused by faults (short circuits) on the power system or starting of large loads 
(e.g., motors). Momentary power interruptions cause a complete loss of voltage for a period less than 1 min. They are 
caused by protective devices (reclosers) in response to faults as attempts to clear non-permanent faults, first opening 
and then reclosing after a short time delay. A permanent power interruption, in turn, is defined as the decrease in the 
voltage supply magnitude to zero for more than 1 min. They are generally caused by trees striking lines or poles, 
storms, or miscoordination of protection devices.

Once the time values of the sensitivity to the sinking voltage of each device in the production process are 
known, we generate a database collected from equipment analysis and data issued by equipment manufacturers. By 
entering the values, it is possible to obtain the PIT values constantly without the need for a measuring device. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The development of a program capable of generating the total time of support to the voltage sags, coming 
from the electricity distribution network, is essential to keep the productive process efficient, without stoppings and, 
consequently, without repeated sets up.  
The immunity of an industrial process allows to analyse its operational continuity during a voltage sag. 
Different processes or similar processes may have different characteristics, thus, to identify the immunity of a process, 
it is necessary to identify the most critical equipment within a process. The process immunity time - PIT defines the 
operational inertia of the production process with respect voltage sags. PIT is quantified after the failure of the 
equipment that controls the process. Process immunity is directly proportional to the PIT value. 
In this way, the development of this programming allows the visualization of the total time of support of the 
process, being able to assist corrective and preventive actions to reduce financial losses with respect to unexpected 
production stoppings caused by voltage sags.

Abstract 
The small scale miners (SSM) sector plays a key role in terms of contribution to the economy in Zimbabwe. As 
a growing sector, the SSM must make sure they have capital for their operations, train their staff and must be 
alive to the changes in government policies so that their business models stay afloat. Continuous budgetary 
control, brand management, customer satisfaction and continues monitoring and evaluation of the strategic plan 
are some of the factors that must be considered for the SSM sector to remain afloat and active. 
Keywords: Business strategies, small scale miners, survival strategies 
1. Introduction 
The mining sector is one of the key drivers for the Zimbabwean economy with the small scale miners and 
medium small scale miners playing a critical role in both employment creation and improvement of livelihoods. 
However, these miners are faced with various challenges which include lack of capital, raw material availability, 
foreign currency availability, policy inconsistences as well as competition from large scale miners. In summary, 
the performance of these miners is dependent on the industry context, the market and the Government policies 
as indicated in Figure 1.

574","Seizing of new opportunities: Bigger companies are too cumbersome to move quickly; this can be a competitive 
advantage for you. As small organizations they must be swift to take advantage of new and existing business 
opportunities. SSM owners must also maximize on the existing market at the maintenance stage of marketing so 
that they do not lose their already existing customers. Technological advancement in e-commerce and financial 
engineering must be looked at and adopted looking at how new products can be developed from the existing 
ones.  
Costs management: The SSM owners. Executives and Management must also learn to live within their current 
expenditure and cost. It is important to learn to live on the edge so that expenditure is minimized. 
Innovation: Innovate consistently on the little things that the big companies ignore. Little things often make big 
differences in business and are creative. The SSM owners Executive and Management must constantly look for 
ways of improving their market base through product and quality improvement.  
Being alive to the customer needs and demands: The SSM Executive and Management must ensure that they 
meet the customer expectation and demands for their mining including addressing complaints and issues raised. 
Listening to the customer’s complaint and acting fast on them will ensure they remain in business.  
Business Threats Assessment: The SSM Executive and Management must periodically do a SWOT analysis to 
identify possible additional threats to the business market and identify how these can be mitigated. Meeting 
regularly with your business team and brainstorming is of utmost importance whereby complicated business 
problems are mostly resolved at brainstorming sessions. 
Budget Management: The SSM Executives and Management must always ensure they stick to their planned 
budget. It is important that they run lean and avoid unnecessary expenses. 
Reduction of Operational Costs: The SSM Executive and Management can also adopt other strategies such 
asking people to distribute their fliers for free so that they have low operating costs and still reach to their target 
market. They must not hesitate to seek external help where need be. Sometimes, it takes an external, emotionally 
unattached individual to detect your business flaws and render unbiased advice. 
Maintenance of Existing Customers: There is also need for the SSM owners Executive and Management to have 
an aggressive attitude in order to maintain the existing customers. Follow your instincts in terms of business 
strategy and live with the consequences. 
Legal Compliance: The SSM Executive and Management must always ensure they are in compliance with the 
legal requirements of the country to avoid litigations. Avoid litigations as they are expensive and consume loads 
of time but if you have got a good case and a better chance of winning; then fight it out. 
Excellent Service Delivery: The SSM Executive and Management must ensure that they offer excellent services 
so that their service will do the marketing for them (Falkner and Hiebl., 2015). Free publicity and word of 
mouth is probably the best and cheapest form of advertising and must be used for the organization’s advantage.  
Debt Minimization: The SSM Executive and Management must minimize getting loans but seek other 
alternatives which do not attract interest so that they maximize on their income. Capital must be raised by any 
means necessary. Learn to raise capital by any means necessary as that is the primary job of the organization. 
You must continually raise capital from family and friends, banks, suppliers, customers and investors 
Winning Partnerships: The SSM Executive and Management must form partnerships with other mining 
manufacturing companies who can help them grow and expand their business. The organization must seek out 
strategic alliances as they are essential to growth and provide resistance to bigger competition. 
Management of Failure: When businesses are still small and growing, the changes of failing are also high and 
this can happen in the SSM sector. However, if after all these initiatives are initiated and they eventually fail; it 
is important not to take it personal. There is need to relook at the strategies and start again.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The SSM sector is key in the growth and development of mining in Zimbabwe. The SSM owners, Executive and 
Management must adopt these strategies in order to stay afloat and in business. A strategy to this effect must be 
formulated and programs on how the activities will be formulated on how the programs can be implemented so 
that they remain in business.

Abstract  
 
The maintenance strategy is becoming increasingly critical with the increasing competition in the oil and gas industrial 
environment due to hundreds pieces of equipment, which operate continuously under rigorous operational conditions 
resulting from over pressures and fluctuated temperatures. Many pieces of equipment usually subject to an inspection 
and maintenance during normal operation of a plant. However, others pieces cannot be inspected and maintained 
during normal operation of plant unless plant facilities are totally subjected to shutdown to avoid huge production 
losses in the company. Therefore, the study proposed in this work was to select appropriate maintenance strategies 
that could be divided into four alternative: Preventive Maintenance (PM), Corrective Maintenance (CM), Predictive 
Maintenance (PdM) and Turnaround Maintenance (TAM) to arrange inspection and maintenance scheduling for all 
pieces of equipment in the oil and gas plant based on four criteria: safety, production, cost and availability associated 
with goal of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. The result is to decrease in the cost of maintenance and 
production losses and maximize availability and efficiency of oil and gas plant facilities.

1. Introduction 
Maintenance is considered the most crucial event in today’s oil and gas industrial environment. It is a broad term that 
comprises a set of activities that aim to improve equipment or component. It is an activity that must be performed 
under normal and complicated situations. Its basic objective is to restore rapidly the equipment to its operational 
conditions using available resources such as manpower, spare parts and tools in order to contribute at the improving 
maintenance activities, reducing frequency of failures and increasing skills (Dhillon, 2006). During and up till 
industrial revolution the cultural within the maintenance function was focus on breakdown maintenance. 
 
Maintenance is an effort required to keep plants to continue in their productivity capacity (Lawrence, 2012). 
Maintenance is an attempt to keep whole equipment and restore faulty equipment to a satisfactorily operational 
condition (Elwerfalli et al., 2018). Duffuaa and Ben Daya (2004) also explain that “the combination of activities by 
which equipment or a system is kept in, or restored to, a state in which it can perform its designed functions"". (ibid.) 
describe maintenance as a set of needed functions to restore the equipment to normal situation. Dhillon (2006) states 
that it is a set of proper actions to keep or recovery an equipment to a given function. According to British Standards 
Institution (2010), maintenance is defined as a set of activities of technical and administrative that contributes in 
retaining or restoring of an equipment functionality to required operational condition.

In this work, appropriate maintenance strategy of heat exchanger is identified according to Safety, Production, Cost 
and availability criteria resulting from AHP approach application. Four maintenance policies are considered; PM, CM, 
PdM and TAM. This work shows that TAM is the most appropriate maintenance strategy for heat exchanger used in 
the oil and gas industries.  
 
In the future, AHP approach can be used for other equipment in the same sectors. Therefore, AHP approach is a tool 
to help management in the decision making. This work can also be added a fuzzy logic and risk-based inspection 
models in the selection of appropriate maintenance strategy for other pieces of equipment of oil and gas plants.

Abstract 
The Brazilian construction industry has been marked by many fluctuations in performance in recent 
years. In 2009, it was directly affected by the economic crisis, and the sector suffered a severe recession, 
followed by a slight recovery. By characterizing this sensitivity to the variations of the economy, the 
sector is closely linked with country's development. This work performs an analysis of the reflection 
of these constant oscillations in the performance of companies that operate in the Brazilian civil 
construction sector in the period 2005-2015. This study is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) 
models, and Malmquist Index of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). The TFP Malmquist index is used to 
calculate the change in total factor productivity over the period breaking it down into variations of 
technical and scale efficiency as well as technological progress. Results show that for the analyzed 
constructors set, regression in the overall and pure technical efficiency could be evaluated. It could also 
be observed that most companies operate outside their optimal market scale and that efficiency scores 
and changes in total factor productivity decreased between 2005 and 2015.

Abstract 
The supply chain encompasses a complex network of relationships and information processes within and outside the 
organization, dedicated to finding, producing and serving products. In addition, they should be arranged, 
synchronized and coordinated so that all links are well integrated. This article is the result of a case study which 
addresses the diagnosis and characterization of the supply chain for a perishable product, where a SCOR model is 
used as an aid for strategic decision making, with the purpose of to examine the stages of the supply chain of a 
Colombian coffee producing and exporting company, that includes processes such as planning, raw material 
collection and production process until reaching the final product, considering  the transport logistics in the stages 
where necessary. The SCOR model focuses on four process phases from a first level to fourth level, in 
which opportunities for strategic improvement can be identified, through an introduction to best operational 
practices and a comparative evaluation of performance that helps control operation of the supply chain in detail 
when it comes to perishable products, in order to achieve operational excellence of the supply chain, generating

1. Introduction 
 
Creative industries have cultural, identity and economic development importance for a country. Through them, a 
society expresses itself to the world and to itself. In addition to the cultural factor, these industries generate jobs, 
income and technologies that are fundamental to their operation and collaborate with other sectors of the economy 
(United Nations Conference on Trade and Development - UNCTAD, 2012). In general, they involve equipment and 
activities, each with its specificities, which are constantly updated and therefore in direct relation with research, 
development and innovation. 
 
Since innovation can occur in any sector of the economy, whether in the manufacturing industry, the primary 
industry, the service sector or the public sector, analyzing innovation in the audiovisual industry is a possibility to 
understand a part of the sector that has been overlooked. The audiovisual industry, among the creative industries, is 
important in cultural, social and economic aspects. In this last aspect, there are several ways to measure the impacts 
of the audiovisual sector within the general economy of a country, or even globally. Among these measures are 
exports of audiovisual products and services, which accounted respectively for US $ 811 million and US $ 26.4 
billion in 2008 (UNCTAD, 2012), being 2008 a year of great international crisis. The high numbers put the sector in 
a significant position with regard to world economic transactions, which unfold on cultural and social issues. These 
transactions occur strongly when dealing with products in the audiovisual distribution and exhibition markets in 
peripheral countries, which are historically occupied by foreign companies and products (Canedo, Loiola & 
Pauwels, 2015). By focusing on the technological part of this industry the intention is to understand if this economic 
operation of occupation and exchange also follows the same logic. 
 
The audiovisual production chain is based on technologies that are constantly changing. For an invention to become 
an innovation and commercially exploitable, it must be registered. These registers are mainly filed by patent 
applications. Therefore, for commercial circulation and use of a new technology, it must have its patent required in 
the country where it is to be exploited. Thus, when analyzing patent applications existing in a territory, is possible to 
map the potential interest of economic exploitation of that location and how it relates to innovations in/from a 
particular sector. When focusing on a region like Latin America, the data reveals which countries are interested in

In contrast to the broader CPI overview, shown in Figure 5, the breakdown of subsections with a large number of 
requests shows us greater consistency with respect to protected technologies and the sector studied. While in the 
overview seemingly unrelated areas or very specific features were present, here can be seen elements of the 
Communication and Information Technology complex. The repeated relationship between the data obtained and this 
industrial complex is due not only to the fact that the audiovisual production chain is inserted in it, but mainly 
because many of its industries act as supply and service industries and, therefore, are the technological base for 
audiovisual production.  
 
Among the categories presented, it is worth highlighting those related to the image, either processing (G06T) or 
communication (H04N), which is the one with the highest absolute number of requests. Regarding the audio area, 
can be found H04R and H04S, and the others that pass between processing and data transmission, and areas across 
them.  
 
Each of these categories highlighted here, as well as those previously discussed, has its place within the audiovisual 
production chain. Many of them are in the production sector, such as lighting, those related to image and sound 
capture, or specific machinery. The distribution and display industries are also widely covered by data storage and 
transmission, sound amplification, image projection, as well as furniture and physical elements of movie theaters. 
Many of them cross more than one sector, as they can be used in other industries and chains, such as those closest to 
telecommunications. It can be seen that they are widely used tools and processes and cover important fields of 
technological development, not just for the creative industries. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
With the obtained data and the proposed discussions a first mapping of the existing and protected technologies in the 
Latin American countries was made. From this study, it was possible to visualize in a specific sector what is widely 
placed by theories about innovation: the importance of encouraging research, the predominance of foreign 
technologies and the low investment in own technologies.  
 
Also, the study helps to identify which areas are most prominent within the audiovisual chain sectors and how patent 
applications have increased in recent years. Creative industries can be understood as sectors commercially strategic 
and also in recognition of identities and social empowerment. Some partnerships in this area exist at an early stage,

aimed at innovation. 
 
The study has restrictions, such as search factors and selection criteria, but with the objective of mapping the 
existing technologies in Latin American audiovisual, it raises questions and opens space for further research. The 
relationship between innovation and creative industries, with a focus on the audiovisual production chain, still needs 
to be deepened, but its existence and importance can be seen. Like other industries and economic activities, creative 
industries need to be looked at as such, as sectors that need investment both for the production of their end product, 
and for the industries and companies that enable their actions. Thinking about the Communication and Information 
Technology complex with a focus on support sectors can be a prolific way to understand how audiovisual works in 
countries where the technology bases are mostly foreign. As discussed, national or regional technologies and the 
strengthening of internal markets contribute to the reduction of external dependence and, therefore, to the autonomy 
of each country and region.

596","Teacher readiness in online learning is very important because apart from the teacher as a very important component 
in carrying out the teaching and learning process and also its role in these activities, students need it. So that all aspects 
of the teacher need to be considered, including readiness. Teachers' readiness in carrying out ongoing learning will 
determine learning outcomes, improvements in this aspect are deemed necessary so that teacher readiness increases 
in implementing online learning. 
 
3.2 Infrastructure Factors in The Implementation of the Online Teaching and Learning Process 
The result of the overall score of the infrastructure factor is 33%, meaning that it is said to be ready but requires a little 
improvement, the three indicators that are considered to provide an ELR score, 3.4 <x <4.2 in the range of values and 
categories used in the study, the score shows that the measured factor is adequate. ready but still needs a little 
improvement in its implementation. In this infrastructure factor, there are 5 indicators of teacher perception that are 
assessed in this aspect, namely; Q1: Can the IT infrastructure in the school support the implementation of E-learning; 
Q2: Can the school laboratory support the implementation of E-learning; Q3: Does the Technician at the school have 
strong enough support for the implementation of Online learning; Q4: Is the school willing to help the cost of 
implementing online learning in carrying out the teaching and learning process; Q5: Does the school add internet 
access to support teachers' facilities in carrying out the teaching and learning process at school   
 
The three indicators, the researcher can describe the five questions that will be used by the researcher in the form of 
an ELR table for infrastructure factors.

School infrastructure that supports E-learning requires a little improvement, such as by increasing the number of 
computer laboratories and increasing the number of computers used by teachers in terms of technical improvements 
that support remote learning made by schools so that online learning can run optimally. 
 
Additional school budget costs for implementing E-learning or the proposed additional budget for the government to 
implement E-learning, especially during the Covid-19 epidemic, schools simply cannot implement face-to-face 
learning systems. So that almost all existing schools implement an online learning system so that students can continue 
to learn as usual, then the school must also increase internet access in schools which is used to support the facilities 
of teachers in carrying out the teaching and learning process in schools amidst limitations. As a result of this pandemic, 
teachers access learning through applications such as Google Classroom and also Google Meet to carry out online 
learning. 
 
4. Conclusion  
The researcher's conclusion reveals that the school is ready for the application of online learning based on 
the score described by the category of assessment. However, it also requires habituation so that learning can be carried 
out optimally, this habituation also supports improvement and improvement-oriented to the quality of online learning. 
In terms of teacher readiness, some teachers at the school have been unable to use computers or Android mobile 
phones in carrying out teaching and learning in the new normal era, so they require special assistance and training for 
some teachers who are still not optimal in using ICT. The readiness of infrastructure in schools is not maximally 
adequate due to limited access to Wi-fi networks, so it is necessary to increase access capacity and balance its capacity. 
So that the implementation of remote learning does not experience network and connection barriers.

Abstract 
 
Innovation nowadays is one of the most important factors for any company's long-term success, economic 
development, or technological and scientific advances. In Brazil, the investments in Research and Development are 
mostly public, counting on government support in incentives and specific legislation to foment innovation. Among 
the many factors that influence innovative projects' development are the triple helix relations, which are established 
among universities, industry, and government. The entrepreneurial university is the main institution of this model as 
it represents the largest source of knowledge needed to stimulate technological advancement and entrepreneurship. In 
this scenario, this study aimed to analyze the triple helix relations into science, technology, and innovation support 
institutions linked to a federal university in Brazil. The project consisted of analyzing each triple-helix actor's impact 
in historical data of innovation projects conducted by the university center. As a result, the government sphere's strong 
presence was identified as the main conductor of the innovation process, followed by a university culture of research 
and entrepreneurship in development and industry not as active as it was expected.

1. Introduction 
Innovation nowadays is one of the most important factors for any company's long-term success or the country's 
economic development. In Brazil, the investments in Research and Development are mostly public, counting on 
government support in incentives and specific legislation to foment innovation. 
 
Among the many factors that influence innovative projects' development are the triple helix relations (Etzkowitz and 
Leydesdorff, 2000), which are established among university, industry, and government. This interaction model's main 
objective is to enable the three spheres to be overlapped, supporting each other to reduce barriers and accomplish 
trilateral relations in favor of innovation. The entrepreneurial university is the main institution of this model 
(Etzkowitz, 2003) as it represents the largest source of knowledge needed to stimulate technological advancement and 
entrepreneurship. 
 
Another framework to help understand innovation nowadays is open innovation (West et al., 2014). Open innovation 
is a form of triple helix relation that runs between companies and universities or government agencies and universities. 
Operationally, these relations can be implemented through technology transfer efforts, based on patents, or bilateral 
contracts for technology development (Dahlander and Gann, 2010). 
 
Our classic literature and researched articles do not correlate technology development contracts to patent deposits and 
technology transfer based on them. What are the relations of technology development contracts, patent deposition,

Qualitative data demonstrates that actors, academic and industrial ones, do not trust patents as a differential for their 
business activities. Only four of them resulted in a technology transfer to any company for commercial purposes from 
patent deposition. 
 
5. Discussion 
Data gathered in this research allow some discussion about Brazilian triple helix relations. First of all, a contradiction 
compared to previous literature: most of the projects are funded by government agencies but have short time horizons. 
The expected result, according to Mazucato (2014) was more long-term planning from government agencies. As the 
researched university is in the Brazilian federal district, it can suggest a lack of planning for research and technology. 
Specific research protocols must be designed for this purpose. 
 
A second issue to discuss in the kind of partnership was more present. Suppose taking into account the three 
possibilities of triple helix relations (Figure 2 - Etzkowitz e Leydesdorff (2000), data suggest that the first or the second 
model was more present depending on the profile industry-university relations. We need more data for this 
categorization because, in model 1, the government drives industry-university relations, which is not real in model 2.  
Our data make it possible to infer that model 3 is not the current practice in the studied university. 
 
But our data also suggest that in some studied innovation ecosystem, all the models co-exist, and taking this into 
account, most model 1 may represent our case studied as a typical innovation practice drive by government efforts but 
without a long-planned horizon. 
 
Patent deposition data allow us to corroborate to Etzkowitz (2003) in terms of the role of triple helix relations and its 
results because the patents were more probably generated if the three actors act concurrently in a project for more than 
two-thirds of patent deposition efforts. 
 
Finally, in terms of outcomes of innovative efforts performed on these projects, we see a small tax of entrepreneurship 
return, i.e., the number of patents and mainly innovative companies by resources invested. We had only 19 patents 
generated and only four licensed to a company. If input data were analyzed, almost a third of a billion BRL were 
requested to develop four business models, a really low conversion rate. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The main scientific contribution of this research is that in an emergent country like Brazil, patents are not a focus of 
innovative efforts. The low rate of patents in industry-university projects suggests that businesses are run away from 
patents, but maybe trusting industrial secrets and intimate relationships among actors. Also, the high presence of short-
term projects among industry and university shows a profile that jeopardizes patent deposition possibilities. Data also 
suggest that triple helix's projects outlined more patents. 
 
Qualitative data suggests that the whole context of the Brazilian market and regulatory issues contribute to academics 
and entrepreneurs' mutual mistrust for investing in patents. The conversion rate can be higher than the uncovered by 
this research once industrial and private partners, in general, can use the knowledge gathered in research projects to 
open new non-patent based business. An issue to investigate more in future works. 
 
This research has a practical implication for public decision making in Brazil and emergent countries. For having more 
technological-based business, maybe it will be better to fund triple helix partnerships. In our sample, university-

610","industry relations tend to be more based on short-time cycles. They also have a lower effort to patent deposition. As 
a consequence, they were characterized by a low generation of technology-driven businesses. Therefore, maybe higher 
project cycle-times, and incentives to co-titular patent deposition, can result in more universities spin-offs. 
 
Our article shows the kind of triple helix relation which produce more in terms of technology-driven business. So, an 
example of how bridging research for the society is analyzed. This paper can contribute to the themes of R&D, 
emerging markets, and innovation ecosystems. Its main limitation is based on only one university, one strongly 
leveraged by its place in the Brazilian federal district. Another limitation is the research protocol that does not gather 
qualitative data from third parties of these projects, but only from the university innovation center. Third parties can 
have information regarding technological deployments from these research projects, enriching the whole analysis.

Statistical analysis of female education in income: study case for Brazilian states 
 
The current research is inserted in the quarrel of gender and income in the Brazilian reality. The main 
objective of this work was to have a previous scenario of how factors such: marital status, age, and education 
affect the income of both genders (masculine and feminine) in each Brazilian State (UF). Expanding the 
comprehension of the gender subject within the context of inequalities among regions can be understood as 
a second goal. In order to achieve the targets proposed, this article used data from the Brazilian Institute of 
Geography and Statistics (IBGE) of 2010 and multiple linear regressions. Followed by its statistical 
validations and discussions about the limitations of the model. For the year studied the gender inequality 
between education, income, and age was verified. The results are in agreement the previous quarrel within 
the same area and highlighted the impact of marital state in inequality.

613",,"variables income and education considered exogenous, or, undefined by the determined model. Thus, future research 
would be the application of another statistical method, comparing with the results of this article. 
Despite some tendencies’ confirmation by the results, there are researches to perform in the area. It is believed that 
the comparative analysis using older statistical data in Brazil, enables a comparison among countries. Besides, a 
comparative between developed and underdeveloped countries should be made to verify the difference among results 
of previous researches related to the influence of age, gender and education. There is still a significant gap in gender 
inequality, it is expected that this article contributes to reducing it.

Abstract  
The indicator of Overall Equipment Effectineness (OEE), was obtained to the performance and quality, in the 
production line of La Industria Licorera del Cauca , for Depaletizadora , Triblock, Labeller and Cartoner for 
presentations of sugar-free and traditional aguardiente, for media (375 cc) and bottle (750 cc).It was obtained a a 
fluctuation for availability between 19% and 76%, for Performance indicator between 30% and 49% and the Quality 
indicator 99.33% and 99.99%.; the variable with the most significant failure in the indicator was the availability, the 
change of presentation with 21%, it was allowed to establish that the Cartoning production unit has the lowest 
percentage of the OEE indicator, corresponding to 8% in the sugar-free liquor presentation for the medium format. 
An experimental design (DOE) was carried out using the Minitab18 software, to design the ideal conditions of the 
process for the OEE of unit of production cartoner. The value of P in the ANOVA identified Availability as the 
statistically most significant and influential factor, with a value of P = 0.097 above the value of established 
significance of 0.05 as alpha, contributing to the amount of variation in the response.

Abstract 
 
This article developed an optimization proposal for the manufacturing process of integral eight-meter linear kitchens in the 
CASA MADEIRA company, using the DMAIC method (Define, measure, analyze, implement and control). The work was 
carried out in order to solve the delay in the manufacturing process of integral kitchens of eight linear meters, since its operation 
was not adequate and presented deficiencies in its production stages. 
During the diagnosis of the situation, it was possible to determine that the whole kitchen manufacturing process had an 
efficiency of 58% with respect to the installed capacity, given errors in the planning and programming of tasks. 
As alternative solutions, the following was carried out instructions and standardization documents of the process, as well as 
training of personnel. Of this way it was possible to achieve 91% in the efficiency of the production process, offering a 
comprehensive solution to the problem presented, thus maximizing the effective production times and covering the demand for 
integral cooking, allowing maximum optimization of the process performance and generating greater Annual income for the 
company.

With the implementation of these actions an improvement of 33% is obtained, going from 2 kitchens per week to 3; having a 
total of 12 kitchens per month obtaining a higher production in less time increasing the sales of the company from $ 24,000,000 
to $ 36,000,000 per month, noting a significant improvement from 58% to 91% in the production of integral kitchens of 8 linear

Conclusions 
 
• 
Through the study carried out at Casa Madeira in the production line of integral kitchens of 8 linear meters, it was 
determined that by means of the proposed plant distribution it was possible to increase productivity from 58% to 91%.  
• 
The causes of the delay in the manufacturing process of integral kitchens of 8 linear meters were found in the cutting and 
edging stage because they do not have the procedures and instructions to operate the machine, likewise they do not have 
knowledge of the correct sequence for the manufacture of them. 
• 
A plant layout proposal and analytical diagram is established, reducing the number of activities from 19 to 15, of which 5 
are for operations, 7 for transportation, 2 for inspection and 1 for storage.. 
• 
A total time of 19.40 h/unit is achieved, resulting in a reduction of 8.70 h/unit and 14 meters in transports.  
• 
It is possible to go from 2 kitchens per week to 3; having a total of 12 kitchens per month, obtaining higher production in 
less time, increasing the company's sales from $ 24,000,000 to $ 36,000,000, which increases the company's sales by 33% 
per month.

Abstract 
 
The University-Industry (U-I) cooperation has been recognized as an essential strategy for innovation between 
scientific and business society. However, this partnership is not easy to manage; different points of view, 
objectives, and motivations can drift them apart from its goal. As a result, understand the Critical Success Factors 
(CSF) involved in cooperation projects might represent a fruitful advantage for both sides. This article proposes 
a holistic model of five dimensions: organizational context, team leadership, execution & control, team structure, 
and team processes. Our research carried through a case of study in the Aerospace and Defense (A&D) industry, 
comparing all of the success factors concerning three variables: cost, schedule, and operability; thus, aim at eight 
underestimated critical success factors.

Critical success factors (CSF), university-industry cooperation (U-I), management of collaborative projects, 
aerospace and defense (A&D). 
 
1. Introduction 
In an environment of globalization, fierce competition drives the modernization of processes, products, services, 
and notably about commissioning technological innovation strategies in their business (Chan, 2004). Therefore, 
successful companies, in the long term, evolve in timekeeping a minimum core on R&D investment, which 
consists of wage payments to highly trained scientists, engineers, and other skilled technology workers who often 
require a great deal of firm-specific training (Brown, Martinsson, & Petersen, 2012). Even though knowing this 
type of structure is suffering from a critical shortage of high-skilled workers, cause the return of investment (ROI) 
is not apparent (Michael Collins, 2018).  
 
To overcome, from this perspective, the collaboration between the universities and industry (U-I) relationship has 
been consolidated as an effective alternative to create and share knowledge; towards sustaining technological and 
innovative growth (Soares, Torkomian, Nagano, & Moreira, 2016). In this sense, the connection between U-I and 
its impacts on innovation processes has been the object of longstanding analysis in various academic communities 
(Gonçalo e Zanluchi, 2011). 
 
Although it is still an approach not widely practiced and escorted by barriers, generally, related to the management 
issue due to the dual nature of project control in this context; mixing different organizational cultures which are 
result in conflicting attitudes imposing a series of barriers to establishing trust between partners (Davenport, 
Davies, & Grimes, 1998). For example, academia has a more long-term view of their work, and the company has 
a shorter-term; they also have different goals, focuses, and ways of working (Wallin, Isaksson, Larsson, & 
Elfström, 2014). Until 2007 (Milosevic and Patanakul, 2005), project management has been present in the 
literature as practitioner-driven and has relied upon war stories, normative approaches, and lists of factors derived 
from surveys of project practitioner opinions. Nevertheless, most research on the management of projects often

645",,"It brings us to the next dimension to be analyzed, the execution and control. Alignment plays an essential role 
with teams and realignment, which should be addressed to all members to minimize the possibility of unforeseen 
events since each team member has unique experiences and unique contributions to the project. In this case, the 
alignment depends on the type of control adopted, which should preferably be proactive, allowing a more intimate 
integration between them. This type of control adopted only makes sense when planning is performed in waves 
(regardless of the type of project chosen). Although planning in waves, the technical work must always be sizing 
and planned by the knowledge holder; although obvious, it is crucial to ensure accurate adherence to partial 
deliveries (documentation) and milestones compliance. To mitigate delivery issues, a web portal is a cheap and 
straightforward way to do it; it will save much time for the teams and avoid problems related to different versions 
of documents, reports, plans, etc.  
 
The team structure is the next dimension to be analyzed, which has six variables. Regarding the most critical team 
experience (the two parts), they must have the technical qualification at the appropriate depth level; knowing what 
to do next increases problem-solving speed. However, this professional demands certain autonomy for decision-
making. In this context, although it seems antagonistic, the same specialist should perform activities in a generalist 
way in other areas; that is, multitasking. For the project, it represents a gain in performance and dynamism for 
action. A key point is “communication”; never leave anything implicit, in doubt, be redundant in the project's key 
issues and critical alignments. The communication also could be affected by the physical allocation of people; 
either the layout or appropriate location creates a kind of team identity which allows narrowing and facilitating 
communication; even in some cases, it avoids postponing crucial decisions. 
 
5. Considerations 
This article presents and discusses a set of critical success factors and, through a case study in the A&D sector, 
analyzes the potential for improvement in the execution of technological innovation projects (NPD) in partnership 
with institutions of research. The application of the suggestions made after the analyses could considerably 
increase the probability of success of this nature's projects. It should be noted that the case study and its results 
are restricted to a single company, based on a small sample within a restricted period six-year time. It suggested 
applying the six-dimensional holistic model in other companies and different sectors to validate their analysis 
potential demonstrated in this article, thus allowing the development of a guide to ""best practices"" for these types 
of projects.

Abstract 
 
The literature indicates that inadequate communication with stakeholders and activities’ inherent uncertainties are 
some of the main causes of project failure. Therefore, two essential areas of project management are risk 
management and stakeholder engagement plan. In this matter, this study aims to evaluate how stakeholders affects 
project risks and how they relate to project success from the understanding of concepts and management tools. 
Four factors related to stakeholder management were defined as guides for the creation of eight scenarios, which 
resulted in different probabilities for three risk variables. Nine interviews with IT projects experts and specialists 
on project management education were conducted to obtain opinions on the proposed scenarios. The consistency 
of responses was verified by the Delphi method and by the coefficient of variation. The statistical method of 
Design of Experiments was applied, using Minitab® software, for the construction of the research instrument and 
for data analysis. Therefore, the effects of the factors ‘stakeholder register’, ‘stakeholder engagement’, 
‘communication with stakeholders’, and ‘number of stakeholder groups’ on response variables ‘negative risk 
incidence’, ‘opportunities incidence’, and ‘development of contingency strategies’ were identified. Results show 
that the engagement and communication with stakeholders have a significant influence in the occurrence of 
negative risks, in the occurrence of opportunities and in the development of contingency strategies for the analyzed 
scenarios.

1. Introduction 
 
The development of Project Management (PM) aims at the reduction of risks and efficient use of 
resources during the project (Kerzner, 2009). The business environment has several challenges such as 
uncertainties, technologies, and partnerships, among others; therefore, companies search for high effectiveness 
solutions and strategies to achieve higher project management performance and to adapt to the new market (Ika 
et al., 2020; Kerzner, 2009). 
 
The inefficient communication between the people involved and the high complexity of tasks are key 
factors for project failure (Gupta et al., 2019). Hence, the stakeholder engagement and the risk analysis are two 
main areas of project management. The cooperation between all the stakeholders improves the project 
development and creates competitive advantages to the company (Luu et al., 2008). Besides that, stakeholders 
have considerable influence in differents aspects and they must be aligned with strategic goals of the project’s 
crew (Cuppen et al., 2016). 
 
Uncertainties are inherent to any undertaking and it could have both positive and negative effects that 
should be monitored through the project’s life cycle (Wied et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2018). The integration of 
stakeholders and risks management reduces the conflict of interest, increases the efficiency of resources allocation, 
improves the management decisions and allows new perspectives for the project. Previous studies demonstrate 
that stakeholder management and risk management also have a positive impact on cost reduction (Civera et al., 
2019; Ika et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2018).  
 
In an Information Technology (IT) environment, projects present high failure rates in consequence of the 
poor risk management and also organization aspects such as the relations between team members (Butler et al.,

Similar to the previous analysis, the factor ‘expert’ was not significant by the estimated model to the 
development of contingency strategies (Y3). The stakeholders engagement and the communication with 
stakeholders are the most relevant to the Y3 (p-value < 0.01), namely, the positive variation of these factors 
improve the contingency strategies possibility. Besides that, F1 is significant in 10% indicating a lower influence 
on Y3, as shown in Figure 6. 
 
 
 
Figure 6 - Factors' effect on the development of contingency strategies. 
 
The number of stakeholders groups presented the lowest impact on Y3. The variable ‘contingency 
strategies’ is not affected by this factor on the scenarios elaborated. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The inefficient risk management and the miscommunication with the people involved in the project are the 
main project failure causes (Gupta et al., 2019). The understanding and the integration of these two areas are 
essential to create innovative solutions and to the IT project effective development (Bernardo et al., 2015; 
Lehtinen and Aaltonen, 2020; Xia et al., 2018). Using the Design of Experiments method, this paper extended 
knowledge in this matter by highlighting the impact of stakeholder engagement and communication with 
stakeholders on negative risk incidence, on opportunities incidence and on development of contingency strategies. 
According to the experts and to the estimated models, these factors related to stakeholder management present the 
greater effects on risk management area and, thus, possibly in project success. 
The research did not include the synergy between stakeholders and risks, but it is also important to 
understand the actions that affect both areas simultaneously to increase the probability of project success. The PM 
also have several branches such as costs, quality, and resources that could be analyzed along with the chosen 
areas.

Abstract 
 
The human activity of walk and run leads to the join femur-hip a cyclic load and a fluctuant stress and strain that is 
able to produce cracks or fracture due to fatigue that is a progressive and permanent change in material endurance. 
Brazilian standards define the position, intensity and number of cycles of the load to simulate the real life of a new 
protheses designed. The aim of this study is to predict the failure progression of ASTM F75 alloy femoral prostheses 
under fatigue analysis whit finite element method for simulation. The alloy F75 shows satisfactory results in static 
analysis, but in the dynamic analysis nether exceeds 5 million cycles and it presents fail in the safety factor to fatigue. 
 
Keywords: Femoral hip protheses, simulation, fatigue, finite element method. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The use of simulations in the factories is becoming increasingly necessary due to the search for productivity and 
competitiveness, allowing the testing and improvement of processes and products still in the design phase, reducing 
costs and design and production time. CAE systems (for computer-aided engineering) are computer systems associated 
with product design and simulations by finite element modeling. Design systems and software include geometric 
modeling, engineering analysis packages such as finite element modeling, design review and evaluation, and 
automated drafting (Groover, 2013). This work is focused on the area of modeling and simulation, a greater emphasis 
is given to femoral prostheses fatigue simulation, as it involves important technological concepts of product 
development. 
Metallic biomaterials are used for load bearing applications and must have sufficient fatigue strength to endure the 
rigors of daily activity. The main property required of a metal as biomaterial is that it does not illicit an adverse reaction 
when placed into services, that means to be a biocompatible material. As well, good mechanical properties,

Abstract 
 
The licensing of technologies of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Institutions (STIs) is recognized as a 
traditional and established vehicle for bringing the knowledge produced in universities and research centres to 
consumers, using companies from the production environment as intermediaries. To better understand the factors 
related to efficiency in the licensing process for STI technologies for companies, a search for studies that addressed 
the subject was carried out, using the method of systematic literature review (SLR). The review presents the aspects 
indicated by the authors as responsible for the efficiency in the process. The results were used to answer descriptive 
questions, such as in which situation and how the licensing occurred and which aspects impacted on the commercial 
success of the product arising from the technology. Also, the results were used to answer prescriptive efficiency 
questions, such as when and how licensing should occur and what should be done to influence the success of 
economic exploration. The structuring of questions and answers, together with the review, contribute to present the 
state of the art of the literature on procedures related to efficiency in technology licensing. 
 
Keywords: Technology transfer; Technology licensing; Universities; Research Centre; Efficiency. 
 
1. Introduction 
Technology licensing activities are understood as the main way of taking what is developed by universities and 
research centres to the production environment (Chapple et al. 2005, Ho et al. 2014). The main responsible for this 
action is the fact that universities and research centres rarely produce and commercialize their technologies directly 
with consumers (Elfenbein 2007, Jensen and Thursby 2001), thus having licensed companies as intermediaries 
between research and the final market. 
The process for technology licensing is complex owing to the interaction between various actors and to the direct 
influence of different contexts, in which are inserted the companies receiving the technologies, as well as 
universities and research centres, called by Brazilian legislation (law 13.243/2016) as Scientific, Technological and 
Innovation Institutions (STIs). To contribute to the technological and economic development strategy of nations, 
STIs have been driven and encouraged by governments to protect their inventions by obtaining intellectual property 
rights and, subsequently, licensing them to companies in the production environment (Sapir and Kameo 2019). This 
licensing generates a new source of funds for institutions, assisting in economic development in their respective 
regions (Becerra et al. 2018, Kim et al. 2014, Lee and Win 2004, Muscio 2010). Considering that the government 
incentive is often financial, it is necessary to carry out evaluations on the efficiency in protecting and licensing 
technologies (Necoechea-Mondragón et al. 2013). 
The systematic evaluation of efficiency in technology licensing processes, however, does not have a unanimous 
method in the academic community. There is a lot of information about which critical factors influence the process 
of transposing from the academic technology stage to the product inserted in the market. One of the parameters to

Abstract 
 
The present work will discuss a case study of the development of the drug VONAU FLASH, focusing on the triple 
helix model, based on the partnership between the University of São Paulo and the laboratory BIOLAB SANUS 
FARMACÊUTICA LTDA. The innovation resulted from an objective initiative formulated by the interested company, 
which allowed the creation of the university's patent and transferred technology to the pharmaceutical company. The 
commercialization of the developed drug represents 90% of the royalties' revenue from the University of São Paulo, 
totaling approximately 3,4 million BRL per year. The laboratory projects annual earnings of nearly 165 million BRL 
per year with the sale of VONAU-FLASH developed with the partnership signed between the University and the 
company.

1. Introduction 
The improvement of the necessary gears for the development of innovation has become a constant and central concern 
of public policies in most western countries arising from Schumpeter's idea from the expression known as creative 
destruction (SCHUMPETER, 1942). 
This expression identifies that the capitalist system evolves continuously through an internal process of constructing 
and deconstructing different productive models, such as a constant self-destructive and regenerative march, evidencing 
the essential character of product and process innovation evolution.

699",,"This reasoning derives from the idea that, among the triple helix's entities, companies can better evaluate the possible 
return on investment or even present indicators that the invention to be developed has an effective and practical impact 
and can effectively enter the market. 
 
The company has better conditions to evaluate the market and specify production costs. It also has an interest in 
verifying the gaps to be filled to obtain a competitive advantage in its competitors' face. In this way, in a Schumpeterian 
view, the company would be the entity ablest to promote ""creative destruction"" or lead the innovation process. In this 
sense, the triple helix model, capable of generating technological development, appears to have a greater chance of 
success when the initiative originally took place through demand from an interested company itself.  
 
The case analyzed innovation had better conditions to enter the market effectively and generate dividends for the 
university that developed the research and the interested company, and the inventor himself. The analysis of similar 
cases in the future may serve as a support for proving the idea presented and reinforcing the need to establish new 
mechanisms or initiatives that encourage companies to propose research projects in partnership with Brazilian 
universities. The presentation of successful cases allows building a wealth of good practices that boost the work 
processes of universities, companies, and government agencies whose purpose is to reinforce the development of 
innovative business models in Brazil. 
 
The research's main limitation is that it is based on a single case, analyzed in detail. Another limitation is that there 
was no possibility of conducting interviews with those responsible for the initiative presented here, which implies no 
triangulation of the research data. Future research could address these limitations.

Abstract 
This work aims to study the relations between Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approaches in engineering education and 
the evaluation methodology in an under graduation and multidisciplinary engineering discipline in the area of new 
product development. Students were divided into two classes: a basic Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach, such 
as teamwork, and a non-structured mission with specific deliverables. The other has the same basis but added 
Integration Scenarios (IS). IS demands students to think about a fictitious company where they could produce and sell 
the new product developed. Both disciplines were based on a Mechatronic Reference Model (MRM) for new product 
development. A new framework of students' grades connecting Knowledge, Abilities, and Attitudes (KAA) was used 
to evaluate their performances. As a result, we analyze students' perception of the learning experience in both classes. 
The most well-developed competencies were teamwork and leadership.

Introduction 
In engineering schools, educators face several challenges, including the difficulties of teaching demanding technical 
content, the constantly evolving technologies, and the industry's demand for highly qualified professionals that can be 
absorbed immediately. For centuries, lecturing (expository explanation) has been the norm in the engineering 
classroom. Nevertheless, several authors advocate that the pedagogy based only on expository explanation leaves 
engineering graduates poorly prepared to understand the profession's complexities (Melsa et al., 2009). 
 
More specifically, teaching approaches based only on expository lectures emphasize procedural knowledge and do 
not keep the students' attention, which leads to low-frequency rates (Mills and Treagust, 2003). In other words, 
students may not feel motivated to go to classes and might have difficulties retaining information passed on lectures, 
which emphasize memorization and recollection. The emphasis on memorization, rather than on practice, does not 
allow students to see the content's application, contributing to the high evasion rates in the engineering courses. Also, 
traditional methodologies do not focus on non-technical skills, such as communication and collaboration, highly 
valued in the job market (Nguyen, 1998; Reis et al., 2017). 
 
According to the Brazilian Association of Engineering Education, evasion rates reach almost 50% in Brazil (Abenge, 
2018). A report by the American Society for Engineering Education (Education, 2012) highlights that it is necessary 
to train engineers that can deal with the multifaceted nature of the 21st century. A recent recommendation for

711",,"In summary, in our research, we have found many interesting engineering education's works, which use the PBL 
methodology. In terms of works that aligned learning and assessment instruments, we found that most of the works 
had issues evaluating purely interactive performance definitions. More specifically, the knowledge, abilities, and 
attitudes that should be explored in active methodologies and the evaluation methodologies that measure their degree 
of achievement in the teaching-learning process are not aligned. Another point worth highlighting in the list of lessons 
learned is that active learning can be combined with several evaluative instruments, giving the teacher an expressive 
number of performance assessment options.

Abstract 
 
Brazil does not present the impulses and motivations that led other countries to establish policies for electromobility, 
as there are other peculiarities in its energy matrix that disperse efforts towards vehicular electrification. This article 
presents a documental analysis of the main policy instruments for mobility, the main stakeholders, and some 
propositions, mainly from the State, in the federal, state and municipal spheres, that can impact the process. This 
analysis allows to build a framework which was taken as basis for a research protocol under a Q-method, which 
combines qualitative and quantitative techniques, to describe and analyze subjectivity among Brazilians key specialists 
regarding their views on opportunities and treats to electromobility in the country. The purpose is to propose a 
Brazilian electromobility policy model. This article presents the first steps into this effort. 
 
Keywords 
Electric vehicles, electromobility, policy, Q-method, model. 
 
1. 
Introduction 
The impulses and motivations that lead the other countries to adopt electric vehicles (EV) do not apply to the Brazilian 
case, since there is no latent social or environmental movement that promotes, by itself, a direction of actions both 
public and private partnerships in the electromobility aspect. The country has other characteristics in its energy matrix 
that are insufficient to boost the motivations of adopting EV. The vision for the adoption of EV should be strategic, 
since the Brazilian situation is contextualized in a potential position, justifying the adoption of EV by its potential to 
open paths and not to correct deficiencies generated using fossil energies or their economic and social unfolding. 
 
Therefore, unlike the experiences of electromobility of other countries, Brazil is not relevant in this segment, on the 
other hand, this is not related to the relative importance of the country in the segment of Internal Combustion Vehicles 
(ICE), since the country is one of the ten largest producers of vehicles and has an outstanding fleet in circulation of 
65.835 million vehicles: automobiles, motorcycles, buses, trucks and vans (Amaral et al. 2018). The rate of 
motorization is still in exponential growth with about 36.3 vehicles per 100 inhabitants. Meanwhile, the country had 
in 2015 a fleet of only 2,5 thousand electric and hybrid cars (Delgado et al. 2017). But it is increasing fast with new

713","declining, but there are technical and economic barriers to be overcome to determine the next generation of batteries. 
This allows non-leading countries to still bet on innovative and disruptive technologies and occupy global niches in 
electromobility. 
 
Finally, electromobility strategies involve several aspects such as the high electricity prices in Brazil, due to the tax 
burden. Researchers as Silva et al. (2018) discusses energy prices and subsidies to facilitate EVs adoption in Brazil. 
 
The proposal of the ongoing research tries to raise these and other aspects of the opportunities and threats of 
electromobility through the opinion of key Brazilian experts. The research seeks to describe and analyze these opinions 
using the Q method combining qualitative and quantitative techniques. 
6. 
Conclusions 
In conclusion, the purchase of BEV in Brazil is difficult given the payback period of purchasing, the electricity price, 
(Silva et  al. 2018), the current number of fuelling stations and infrastruture (Benvenutti et al. 2017) and the lack of 
electromobility policies beyond subisidies (Consoni et al. 2018). 
 
Thus, this article presents a review of the main policy instruments for electromobility and some initiatives, mainly 
from the State, in the federal, state and municipal spheres, that should impact the process. Brazil State eagers develop 
a electromobility business model. It might come from a future research protocol under a Q-method, which combines 
qualitative and quantitative techniques, to describe and analyze subjectivity among Brazilians key specialists regarding 
their views on opportunities and treats to electromobility in Brazil. The purpose is to propose a Brazilian 
electromobility policy model. This article presents the first steps into this effort.

Abstract 
 
The calculation of the life cycle cost is one of the most complete management techniques to predict an entire product 
life cycle, as it addresses all phases of a product from its development, its production, use, support and even its ruin. 
As the cost is a critical factor for the competitiveness and survival of a company in the market, its calculation is one 
of the main factors that subsidize the decision making about the definition of a product and its constituent raw 
materials. However, these options are totally linked to the future sustainability of this product throughout its life cycle. 
Thus, this work sought to identify the state of the art, through a bibliometric analysis, of publications related to the 
calculation of the product's life cycle cost as a line for planning the sustainability of a product throughout its entire 
cycle of life. This research identified that there is an exponential growth of research on this topic, there is a lot of 
potential for further research and that the calculation of the life cycle cost and the sustainability of products are really 
associated, as currents and relevant themes for contemporary society, focused on solutions for environmental 
sustainability and preservation issues.

725","Figure 4. Keyword networks 
 
Analyzing Figure 4, we can identify three large groups of words, which, led by their most cited key words, suggest 
the following main thematic areas: Energy and construction industry (building, energy, residential building, energy 
consumption), Product development (life cycle cost analysis, development, Project, calculation) and environment 
(environmental impact, life cycle assessment, emission, reduction). 
 
4. Discussions 
The analysis of the number of publications per year shows that interest on the subject is increasing with a strong 
growth trend. This trend is consistent with the increase in environmental problems that are plaguing the world as well 
as with global actions aimed at seeking solutions to reduce such problems. Further, the spread of publications 
throughout magazines of different areas of focus showcases the relevance of the topic across different domains of 
interest. 
 
The distribution of publications by countries coincides with the main economic and knowledge generation axes today: 
China, the United States and Western Europe. This fact could point towards the perception by such countries that the 
researched theme is a potential generator of technological advantage for the production of wealth. This is a hypothesis, 
and despite it, some other leads, also point towards the lack of research maturity on the topic, as we could not identify 
any large school of thought or any countries in particular that largely dominate knowledge on the subject.  
 
Finally, the analysis of keywords with its three groups revealed the thematic areas involved. The strong relationship 
between product development, power generation and construction with impacts on the environment was clear. Seeking 
to synthesize the connections of the areas formed by the key words, despite being more used in product development, 
we will identify the calculation of the life cycle cost during development / construction, subsidizing decisions that will 
impact sustainability. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Our Bibliometric analysis regarding relation between the calculation of the cost of the life cycle and the sustainability 
of a product, showed that: there is an exponential growth of interest on the subject, as we can see by the increasing

730","amount of publications over the years; we can also conclude that there is a lot of potential for additional research, 
given the current low overall production of articles.  
 
The analysis of the keywords in these few works shows that the life cycle cost and the sustainability of the products 
are, in fact, associated themes, being also current and relevant for contemporary society, focused on the solution of 
sustainability and environmental preservation issues. It also showed that the calculation of the cost of the life cycle is 
still more common in product development, perhaps because this is the area most linked to the defense industry, which 
due to its great technological complexity gave rise to this technique. What it demonstrates, the great potential of 
application of the calculation of the cost of the cycle of life in the other areas for reduction of the environmental 
problems and of sustainability. 
 
As limitations, this research was carried out on top of a single database, namely Scopus, which limits its scope. Thus, 
it is suggested that future studies adopt more bases and that articles related to the theme receive a more detailed 
analysis. This research will continue in a qualitative phase for in-depth comprehension of the theoretical and empirical 
relation on this theme.

Introduction
It is very acceptable to confirm the necessity to estimate costs and benefit, considering reduced resources, involved 
in complex system development is constant in organizations. To attend international standards, to achieve 
satisfactory levels of reliability, availability, maintainability and safety, these factors must be considered in early 
stage of the conception phase. Despite the evolution of languages for description [1], methods for analysis and 
evaluation [2], [3] and modeling using scenarios [4], [5], to design system architecture, from the knowledge of a 
given domain, including an assessment of non-functional requirements, considering possible conflicts between them, 
there are few systematized procedures that indicate how to resolve them [6], [7], [8], [9], conflict solutions, in 
various situations, run through the expertise of project participants, carried out in an ad hoc manner. Organizations 
are investing heavily in technology in order to stay competitive. For many of those organizations, improving project 
success rates is critical for their survival. The failure projects is of often linked to shortcomings in the conception 
phase, especially in requirements identification dealing with non-functional requirements (NFRs), because NFRs is 
viewed as a particularly difficult part of requirements engineering. 
The industry has to be competitive and efficient in railroad domain developing standard and low-cost solutions. 
In addition to competitiveness some factors that can result in undesirable effects must be considered to ensure the 
safety of the system and to avoid the loss of human lives or major financial and material damage. The high-cost for 
development, implementation, operation and maintenance system, inhibits the growth of the metro-railroad network. 
This paper presents a set of fundamental requirements for critical security systems, seeking to systematize the 
decision-making process, as well as, to relate standards and good practices presented in systems development, 
including the market reality and limitations, both scientific and practical aspects, the definition of an architecture, 
which meets the expectations of interested parties regarding the cost of its development. The objective of this work 
is to present a negotiation approach for conflict resolution, in order to support the documentation of the rationale, 
which can be used in similar projects. For this purpose, the guidelines presented in [7] are used to support decision 
making at the beginning of the system design. Taking into account the international standards [10], [11], [12] 
applicable on the railway domain and a combination of the guidelines presented in [13] for the use of scenarios and 
in [14], [15] for the stakeholder participation in the project and regarding the cost and benefit assessment of an 
architecture. For the development of this work a real case is used, the on-board Automatic Train Control (ATC) 
subsystem included on Railway Signaling System.

in order to give the necessary support to those interested in the project, in relation to decision making.

Conclusion  
In a systematic way of negotiating conflicts, an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative 
architectures in a railway system, for the automatic train control subsystem. In analysis elaboration, adaptations are 
included, in order to propose a systematic, improving the way of driving and avoiding subjectivity in the judgment 
of the interested parties, in relation to the evaluated scenarios. The analysis is guided by RAMS concepts and the 
specific needs of critical security systems, to support both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the 
architecture. This analysis proposal is not intended to be definitive and cover all possible conditions, but rather to 
support system managers and architects, for decision making between alternative architectures. Throughout the 
development of this work, relevant points that make up their contributions are identified. 
Good architecture documentation is crucial for the success of evaluation methods, especially regarding the 
diagrams and descriptors of architecture of a system, in order to organize the rationale adopted in its conduct [29], 
[30]. There is an initial effort in activities to redo the architecture documentation and to elaborate more significant 
scenarios for the operational issues of the system and in order to meet the different requests and changes. The 
possibility of a consensus among those interested in the scenario elicitation phase can result in architectural 
decisions that serve only those stakeholders with greater decision-making power, even when applying a negotiation 
system, this trend exists. The stakeholders involved have different levels of knowledge and before the assessment 
starts, this knowledge must be leveled. In addition, stakeholders are often unaware of the business rules and 
restrictions desired by an organization. A simulation of the projects to be developed would provide indirect gains to 
the system and the organization that carries it out, such as the dissemination of technical knowledge, business rules 
and organization guidelines. 
An organization needs information on how much it will have to invest to increase earnings, and to control and 
mitigate the risks in a project. This systematic way of conducting the definition of an architecture can support the 
identification of risks and quantification of gains. Architectural decisions have an associated cost, the calculation 
presented through ROI, can improve these decisions, clarifying and improving the uncertainty index. The difficulty 
in adopting the methods is the choice between the possible changes that can occur in a system. Selecting a subset of 
strategies is difficult. As the resources for building and maintaining a system are finite, a rational method is needed 
to support the choice of architecture options during the initial design and in the subsequent phases. Getting 
stakeholders to take over this process is essential. 
For future work, it is considered the need to carry out more simulations to refine the systematization of 
negotiation in the decision process and that the cost and benefit analysis can be compared with previous results, in 
order to improve the rationale to be adopted in other projects. In addition, they must be applied to other application 
domains, in critical security systems, in which case, the technical standards and concepts used as a reference, must 
be revised for the domain in question. In addition, it is necessary to develop automated tools, which can be made 
available, at a low cost, to improve the decision-making process.

Abstract 
The path for a management professional to become a successful leader is often long and requires high 
investments in qualification courses. In order to reduce training efforts of professionals with strong 
management skills, management games involving dynamic decision-making practices in a competitive 
environment have been successfully employed. This paper presents a mathematical model of a management 
game that considers a typical manufacture system, which can be inserted in a more general game 
incorporating thus other sectors of a representative goods producer.  The model includes those decisions 
and interrelations considered relevant for the production management at the shop floor level. In order to 
achieve this objective, a mathematical model capable to simulate a factory was developed considering a 
degree of realism consistent with those decision situations that a player undergoing training would face in 
practice: capacity and layout planning, line balancing, master production and scheduling planning, material 
planning, among others. Other competitors, represented by other players with similar products and 
manufacturing systems, compete for the same market, creating a competitive environment that induces 
additional motivation to look for those decisions that promote advantages for the virtual companies they 
are managing. The dynamic decision process generated by the game tends to provide an environment of 
“learning by doing"", without prejudices in operations of a real shop floor. The insertion of the proposed 
model in a general management simulation model which includes supply management, marketing, logistics, 
costs and accounting allows the player to assess the impact of his decisions at the shop floor level over 
other sectors, especially in the accounting results report.

Abstract 
 
The role of micro and small enterprises is very important for the economic development of the regions. 
This research work is an initial path towards a significant improvement in productivity, efficiency, lead 
time and waste in Peruvian enterprises that must to improvement production and efficiency, increase 
productivity and eliminating wastes to reduce total production cost. This paper presents a case study of a 
micro enterprise dedicated to the manufacture and assembly of wooden desks that are distributed to the 
regional and national market. Process times were taken to determine baseline indicators using the O-T 
diagram. The 5S methodology was implemented to reduce search times for materials and tools and 
movements of operators. Activities were grouped that allowed reducing downtime and increasing 
production. In this sense, production flow was optimized thus reducing non value added activities. The 
results showed that reducing waste time, would enable the enterprise to improve production.

Changing the number of operators affects not only the production capacity, but also the manufacturing unit cost. In 
this sense, adding operators to the process increases the production rate, but the marginal rate decreases with each 
additional operator (Figure 4). With each additional operator, the operating cost of the direct labor of the process is 
increased by the operator's salary.

In order to achieve the result of producing 7 units/day, it has implied identifying the processes of the machines and 
those carried out by the workers. In this way, activities of high labor intensity have been determined to assign a greater 
number of workers. 
The total times obtained in table 5 considering four operators is achieved by incorporating two more operators for 
purely manual tasks, especially in the cutting stage: verification of measurements, selection of piece and calibration. 
Adopting takt time as a guide in production system helped to develop a production scenario that allowed to meet 
market demand. The production system still need to improve the variability and dynamics of the system. 
In the mentioned case study, it has been found that the reason for non-value added activities are due to wrong handling 
material, long distance to find a tool, defect product and waiting time. 
The enterprise has a production of 7 unit/day with the participation of 6 workers but process times are very tight and 
it must be readjusted by to meet market demand. Nowadays, the company has invested in training and tools. He has 
not planned to buy another bordering machine in the next two years. 
Micro and small enterprises are very important in the economic and sustainable development at the Lambayeque 
region (Ulloa et al., 2020). The case study in this paper showed that introduction of lean methods brought opportunities 
for improvements production and a best management. It can be concluded that O-T Diagram is an effective tool for 
identifying processing wastes.

Abstract 
Selecting suppliers of goods for procurement becomes very complex because often a large number of criteria need to 
be considered and some of the criteria cannot be properly assessed. Fluctuations in supplier performance and unknown 
information are always in decision making. Choosing the right supplier can reduce operating costs, increase 
profitability and product quality, increase competitiveness in the market, and serve customers quickly. This study aims 
to propose a method that can facilitate practitioners to select suppliers logically and when uncertainty and/or 
unavailability of assessment information arises. We applied the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method to 
determine the best alternative from several alternatives based on certain criteria. The Technique for Order of 
Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is also used in several Multiple Attribute Decision 
Making (MADM) models because this method has several advantages, namely the concept is simple and easy to 
understand. This research was conducted at a raincoat manufacturing company, namely PT. Trijaya Plastik. The main 
ingredient in making raincoats is PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride). Due to the large number of suppliers who can provide 
goods, this study examines the selection of PVC suppliers for the company's main material. The result of normal 
TOPSIS calculations in supplying the main raw material or PVC is the second supplier, namely PT. Royal Lapastek 
by considering 4 criteria, namely price evaluation, condition of ordered goods, delivery time, and administrative 
evaluation.

1. Introduction 
This article discussed a case study at PT. Trijaya Utama, where is a company engaged in manufacturing that uses 
plastic as the main raw material is plastic. This company is starting to pioneer the manufacture of coats or raincoats 
in Surakarta, Indonesia. The coat with the brand ""Elephant Brand"" to be easily known to consumers, as well as to 
distinguish other similar products. These brands are registered brands so that they obtain legal protection and 
guarantees, especially if there is a problem or imitation of the brand. As a manufacturing company, it has been faced

The third step in processing data using the TOPSIS method is to determine the value of positive ideal solutions and 
negative ideal solutions, as follows: 
𝐴𝐴+ = [𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑥𝑥𝑣𝑣𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎, 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑣𝑣𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎, 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑣𝑣𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎, 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑣𝑣𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎] = [0,27

5. Conclusion 
The results of calculations can be known that there is a difference in the results between calculations using TOPSIS 
normalization of distribution and normalization of an ideal. Based on the value of the index is obtained by normalizing 
the PT Royal Lapastek distribution on the first rank with an index value of 0.77, Inti Dragon peaked at second with 
an index value of 0.47, and PT Innan occupies the third position with an index value of 0.23. On the normalization of 
the ideal position of PT Royal Lapastek on the first rank with an index value of 0.80, the core of the second position 
with Inti Dragon index value of 0.48 and PT Innan occupies the third position with an index value of 0.20. From the 
results above, it can be seen that the normalization of both models is not happening between the rankings. This 
indicates that the result of the calculation of the normal TOPSIS so it can be concluded that the right supplier to supply 
the main raw materials or PVC the company is the second supplier is PT Royal Lapastek. This research gives only 
four main criteria to give judgment on the alternative, therefore further research can be done by adding to the number 
of criteria as well as using other methods.

1. Introduction 
 
Tourism had become the largest and fastest-growing economic sector in Indonesia, not only as an income from foreign 
exchange, but also to release income inequality and to reduce unemployment also to reduce poverty. Hotels in selected 
area must survive and adapt to market changes through dynamic marketing capabilities and meet the customer’s need. 
The capacity to provide innovative offerings to guests and feel the situation to the marketplace is an essential factor 
of the resort enterprise in Indonesia. Potential to offering awesome service to purchasers needs non-stop getting to 
know for hotel management and their workforce, enhancing their provider and shipping methods  according to their 
phase, continuous development to the scope of offerings, inviting purchasers to take part more actively, and be 
attentive to the needs and expectancies of their customers. Dynamic marketing capabilities belief originate study is to 
reveal the strategies company adopt the environmental changes to get their competitive advantage (Teece, Pisano, & 
Shuen, 1997) and (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). This study is the preliminary study of dynamic marketing capability 
in hotel industry that elaborate from the previous study to generate indicators from interviewing general managers, 
director level, and owners.

Abstract 
 
The aim of this study is to identify and analyze efficiency drivers in international airports. To this end, a research was 
designed in three parts. The first part is an exploratory study of the literature, which supports a proposal for a 
representative structure of the typical operations of an international airport and allows the identification of 27 
efficiency drivers implemented at airports in order to obtain the study objectives. The second part is a quantitative 
analysis of 33 Brazilian international airports, which allows them to be classified into different levels of efficiency. 
For that, two analysis techniques were used: a Two-Stage Data Envelopment Analysis (Two-Stage DEA), which 
allowed the comparison of efficiency levels between airports; and the Malmquist Index (mi), which allows comparing 
levels of comparison over time. A third part of the research was a multiple case study that investigated the degree of 
implementation of the 27 practices at three airports selected for different levels of efficiency. Evidence was found that 
confirms 16 out of 27 efficiency drivers.

1. Introduction 
Airports are structures for boarding, disembarking and supporting air operations immersed in complex and dynamic 
environments where political, economic and social interests converge (ANAC, 2016). 
 
According to Assaf and Gillen (2012), airports are important strategic assets for a country, airports facilitate the 
approximate territorial integration of distant communities and promote the commercial, business and tourism 
development of the surrounding regions. Perelman and Serebrisky (2012) also highlighted that airports exercise the 
role of distribution platforms and distribution of loads for supply chains of local and multinational companies. 
 
Globally, an aviation industry employs approximately 10 million people, 35% of the total value of imported and 
exported goods is transported by air, and in 2015, more than 3.5 billion passengers were transported by this mode 
(ATAG, 2016). However, airports are considered internal and external factors that influence the scenarios in which 
they operate and are constantly changing, requiring increasingly robust and flexible management models (Fernandes 
et al., 2015). 
 
Despite the recent drop in economic activity in Brazil, the demand for air transport has grown significantly over the 
past decade. In the early 2000s, policies to facilitate access to credit and the entry of low-cost operators opened the 
market for low-income consumers, and the years 2010 were marked by international events (World Youth Day (2013), 
World Cup (2014) and Olympics (2016) - which tested the capacity limits of the national air infrastructure.This 
demand has exerted enormous pressure on the country's air structure, which has not been able to keep up with its 
growth, generating overcrowded terminals and constant flight delays (Wanke, 2012) 
 
The increasing pressure on airport infrastructure has led the market to focus its efforts on the improvement of 
efficiency and in the use of installed capacity. Zhang et al. (2012) warn that the increase in air demand causes two 
immediate effects: pressure on the infrastructure to increase installed capacity and urgency in the efficient use of 
available resources in order to ease the pressure in the short term. However, investing in capacity is not a trivial

Abstract 
Indonesia has a multicultural culture and culture as ancestral heritage that must be preserved. Culture can be used 
as a noble national identity. One of them is the Karo tribe on the island of Sumatra, especially North Sumatra. The 
Karo indigenous people still carry out their noble cultural rituals. Because in the beginning before their religion 
existed, animism and dynamism or what was called parmalim were their beliefs. In this mini-research, the authors 
looked at the stretching culture of communication interactions carried out by the Karo tribe to the creators who 
were able to control the rain by giving requests as outlined in rituals and prayers called Ndilo wari udan. How 
transcendental communication is carried out by them to the creator as a form of interaction that can be seen from 
a communication perspective. This study looks at the perspective of transcendental communication, although 
rituals in communication interactions can also be seen from the cultural communication approach. The 
observations show that the traditional ceremonies performed by the Karo tribe as a form of the Karo community 
have a transcendental communication model towards their God. Observations are made by looking at data taken 
from several sources, including videos and images published in online news, as well as non-commercial videos. 
 
Keywords: Traditional Ceremony, Transedental Communication, Karo Tribe. 
 
 
1. Introduction  
Indonesia has a diverse cultural wealth in the form of customs, traditional arts to regional languages. Every 
community life is inseparable from cultural values that have been adopted from generation to generation. This 
culture comes from thinking about the habits carried out by the ancestors in the environment where the community 
is located. Culture in society is often regarded as something that has noble values that the local community should 
not violate, even if its position is believed to be higher than binding regulations such as law. This means that people 
believe more that customary violations have a more direct impact on their fate so that they are not violated.

786","The means of communication or channel can be referred to as the media used as a message channel in a 
communication process. The choice of means or media in the communication process depends on the nature of the 
message content to be conveyed. Channels in other terms are called channels, channels are needed by 
communicators in the communication process. Without channels, communication is difficult to proceed properly. 
There is no communication process without channels, for example if we look at the communication process that 
is channeled in two ways, firstly verbal and nonverbal, there is no communication that is conveyed from the two 
forms above. On this occasion the community uses dance as a form of puja. 
 
Many communicators are fooled into paying attention to their listeners in communicating. Communicators must 
classify audiences so that communicators can choose strategies in conveying communication messages. The 
communicator can ask the communicant whether the classification is based on material, education and age. The 
recipient or commonly referred to as the recipient is the party that is the target of the message sent by the source. 
The recipient can consist of one or more people, it can be in the form of groups or groups. The recipient is usually 
referred to by various terms, such as audience, target, communicant, or in English, the audience or receiver. In the 
communication process it is known that the recipient's existence is due to the source. There are no recipients if 
there are no sources. 
 
The recipient is an important element in a communication process, because he is the target of communication. If a 
message is not received by the recipient, it will cause various kinds of problems which often require changes, both 
from the source, message, and channel. Aristotle's view, according to most communication experts, is considered 
more appropriate to support the public communication process both in the form of speech and rhetoric.  
 
The communicant is something that is said to be the recipient of a communication message, the communicant and 
the communicator can change their position if the communication creates a dialogue to answer each other, or a 
signal, a signal sent by an opponent in the communication process in the communication process , the 
communicator must first pay attention to the condition of the communicant. Because if not, then the 
communication process will be useless and will get worse. On this occasion the communicant is something unseen 
who is considered to have great power as a rain regulator. Or in other words, the initial communicant is a place 
where people ask for rain. 
 
Effect / Response / response  
Effects can be interpreted as the communicant's answer to the message the communicator conveys to him. In 
dynamic communication, communicators and communicants will continuously exchange roles. Impact is the effect 
of differences experienced by the communicant before and after receiving the message. If the attitude and behavior 
of the communicant changes according to the content of the message, then the communicator has succeeded well. 
The real effect can be seen from personal opinion, public opinion, or majority opinion. But all of that leads to 
changes that occur in the communicant after receiving the message conveyed by the communicator. 
 
After communication, it is important to pay attention to the effect. Both the communicant and the communicator 
have their respective influences, for example the communicator gives a message to the communicant, the first 
effect felt by the communicator is personal satisfaction because the message content has been confirmed to be 
conveyed to the communicant, but is different. If we turn to the communicant, the effect caused by the 
communicant can be in the form of a change of mind, agreement and others, depending on how the message content 
is received by the communicant. At this ceremony the effect that can be seen is the first message giver, namely the 
community after carrying out the ndilo wari udan ritual will feel satisfied because they think the ritual has been 
carried out and the results are submitted to the congregation ... if it turns out that it will rain after the ritual is 
carried out, the community will judge that the effect of carrying out the ritual is the response of the owner of the 
rain who listens to his prayers, but if it turns out that after the ritual it does not rain, the community will sincerely 
accept it, meaning that there is an error in carrying out the ritual. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Transcendental communication is a form of vertical communication, carried out to God and supernatural beings. 
This transcendental practice is carried out by humans using media which is often referred to as religious rituals, 
such as prayer, dhikr which has spiritual value when doing it. Transcendence can be translated into two meanings 
of understanding in communication, the first is ritual which is considered as a transcendental communication 
medium that is concretely visible to the physical eye, such as dance, offerings, and prayer. We can see directly, 
then the two transcendent meanings felt by humans who interact with their God or supernatural beings. The 
sensations that are felt are difficult to translate into physical language. Because nature and spiritual experiences 
make interactions with different impressions. What we can see is the expression displayed by someone who is in

792","and after transcendent interactions such as happiness, anxiety, anxiety and others, which is called the effect of 
transcendental communication. 
 
In general, transcendental communication is carried out by trying to realize the desires expected by humans, both 
humans as communicators and when God becomes a communicator, a change in the position of the communicator 
occurs when the conditions of the ritual are seen from a different point of view, and communicating is not just 
conveying messages and information. It's just that communication must also form meaning and bring every hope 
that is in it. 
 
Therefore, communication has many essential roles in determining each person's effectiveness and coordinating 
their efforts in achieving their mission. The purpose of communication itself can be seen from two points of view: 
the interests of the communicator or the sender of the message and the interests of the communicant or the recipient 
of the message. The success of communication can be influenced by choice. Communication techniques that we 
do.

Abstract 
 
The emergence of new disruptive technologies, allied to the combination of different scientific and technological 
bases, brings significant productivity and quality gains in industrial processes. This is the fourth industrial revolution 
or Industry 4.0, which affects virtually all segments of human activity, with social and economic consequences. In 
this situation, education is faced with new challenges to train citizens who are ready for this new scenario. Education 
4.0 is a model of education proposed to face these new challenges. In this model, the educator becomes the 
orchestrator of multiple information available in global networks along with the students, seeking to organize and 
synthesize the information and transforming it into knowledge. On the other hand, students become the protagonists 
in this teaching-learning process, where, through multidisciplinary projects, they face challenges and look for 
solutions that allow the construction of knowledge about different disciplines, making possible the development of 
their skills and abilities aligned with the new reality. Given this new model of education, new approaches are being 
developed so that the teaching-learning process is aligned with this new reality, such as the STEAM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) approach, which integrates different areas of knowledge and is 
based on multidisciplinary projects. . This approach provokes students’ interest in scientific research for problem 
solving, and knowledge is constructed in a collaborative and harmonious way among them The purpose of this work 
is to investigate the use of the STEAM approach by educators in Humberto de Campos and Fernanda Pires public 
high schools, located in the city of Sorocaba - SP — based on the proposal to develop a high altitude balloon (HAB) 
project, from its design to its launch — is aligned with the Education 4.0 model. In the first phase of the project, its 
objective was to collect from the atmosphere the following information: cosmic radiation, altitude, velocity and 
temperature for further study on the behavior of cosmic radiation with variations in temperature and pressure. 
During the development of the project, the students experienced the following stages of an engineering project: (a) 
the technical specification of the HAB; (b) the use of different technologies to build a mechatronic system based on 
a small and low-cost single-board computer, but with the functionalities of a large computer; (c) the process of 
integrating the computer with sensors, cameras and GPS; (d) the programming of the computer; (e) the test of 
computer integration with the other components; (f) the development of all project documentation and (g) the launch 
and actual operation of the equipment. An initial qualitative assessment showed that using the STEAM approach 
caused a significant improvement in students’ behavioral attitudes regarding cooperative work, scientific research,

Abstract 
This work shows the development of a platform for STEM experiments in high altitude using a stratospheric 
balloon, how it was developed, the challenges encountered in the whole process and the results of the first 
experiment carried out in this platform: cosmic radiation measurements from ground up to twenty kilometers in 
altitude. This platform features Globalsat GPS tracking, three cameras for recording video and still images and 
sensors for data collection. The onboard computer consists of Arduino and Labrador which are open source 
development boards with a BMP280 sensor for measuring temperature, pressure and altitude data that are stored in a 
mass memory card (microSD). The radiation is measured by a Geiger tube that captures alpha, beta and gamma 
radiation. The knowledge gathered in this experience including planning, launch, rescue and data analysis which are 
important to determine the onboard experiments constraints are shown and discussed. Finally, improvements 
concerning the payload space design and operational processes and important additional features such as telemetry 
and search-and-rescue aid electronics are proposed for the next launch that is scheduled for June 7, 2020.

Answer: Option 4 
 
According to the Max-min method, option 4 is considered the most advantageous from an organizational point of 
view for those responsible for coordinating hydro generating plants. Hence, in addition to using local manpower, 
maintenance managers must choose to request labor from the partner plant, and sign a labor outsourcing contract, 
i.e., carry out a hybrid system of human resources and execute the entire overhaul schedule with a delay of only 4 
days.  
Therefore, the following conditions were met in this case study: maximin columns = minimax rows.  When this occurs 
in a combination of strategies, it can be said that the balance of the game has been achieved. Given the combination

An application of game theory in the area of asset maintenance was presented in this paper. The theory was 
concerned with a delay problem in the overhaul schedule of the assets of a power generating plant. Then, under four 
types of possible strategies, a process of interaction between two power plants, which simulated two associate 
managers or players belonging to a business group, was modeled in order to verify the lowest possible financial loss 
to members among the options available for the solution of the overhaul schedule execution problem. The 
interaction between the players concerned the sharing of labor as a way to reduce the delay time of the overhaul. The 
game was then set up in a table containing the respective losses for each option presented. The viability of the 
players' strategies was assessed using the Max-min method in order to maximize the results of the columns where 
the overhaul plant was located and to minimize the results of the lines where the plant providing human resources 
was located. The result of the simulation of the game helped managers in decision making, showing that the best 
option is to share labor with the partner plant and also establish an outsourcing contract complementing the staff. 
The decision indicated by the method pointed to the lowest financial loss for the group of associate managers and a 
delay of only 4 days in the renovation schedule.

Abstract 
 
This paper aims to present the process of designing and fabricating an automated paper cutting machine. The work 
presented is the result of the graduation project in mechanical engineering program that follows design process 
sequence including benchmarking, conceptual design, product development and fabrication of the prototype.

1. Introduction 
Having an electric paper cutting machines in the market today have made the process of paper cutting easier and 
faster. These machines resulted in a efficiency improvement compared to the manual ones, since manual paper 
cutters lack safety for the user and automation. Users of an automated paper cutting machines usually are companies 
that cut big amounts of papers in the same size, such as printing shops, newspaper printing factories or 
photographers. The companies who produce automated paper cutting machines are concerned about the customers’ 
needs and satisfaction, because it has a direct influence on the increment of market share and sales volume (Slocum, 
2007).   
The motivation behind this research project was the need for designing and manufacturing a paper cutting machine 
that will address certain needs, like safety, cutting speed, cutting accuracy, size of paper, noise level of the machine 
etc. Hence, this project can be considered as redesign project that expected to minimize efforts required for paper 
cutting process (Budynas and Nisbett, 2014). 
Generally, the cutting process aims to apply enough shear force to achieve separation of the paper. Separation will 
occur when shearing stress, caused by applied shearing force, will exceed the ultimate shearing strength of the 
material. According to Gray’s historical account, the first guillotine type paper cutter, shown in Figure 1a, was 
produced in 1855 in Germany. It was patented earlier by Guillaume Massasoit in 1844, and it is a one-armed paper 
cutter (Etherington and Roberts, 1981). Later, different types of cutting machines where developed including rotary 
cutter, shown in Figure 1b, which contains a round cutting blade that slides on a rail and cuts from both directions 
(Liu et al., 2018).

5. Conclusion 
This paper highlights the idea that engineers are capable of modifying existed ideas into more advanced ones. It also 
contains mechanical design used to perform a successful design, that’s why can be beneficial for those who are 
interested in mechanical design projects. As a result, it presents an application of the design process on the example 
of automated paper cutting machine. The a real prototype that addressed all customer requirements was 
manufactured and further modifications were proposed based on test results in order to enhance performance of the 
design and increase safety of the operator.

Abstract 
 
The academic spin-off has an important role in regional, social, and economic development. Therefore, it is relevant 
that this process has its flow of activities delimited from its peculiarities. However, little has been documented on the 
support networks for innovation structured by universities, companies, and government (triple helix) when a spin-off 
effort runs on universities. This study aimed to draw an international panorama on the relationship between academic 
spin-offs and universities through a systematic literature review of existing scientific publications. In the study, the 
importance of the triple helix and support policies for partnerships for academic spin-offs was identified. Literature 
also points to a demand for a deep understanding of resource allocations' best time by business incubators and 
technology transfer offices. There is a research gap concerning the operational mechanisms that connect universities 
and spin-offs to potentialize their relations under a win-win perspective.

1. 
Introduction 
The spin-off is a new organizational form (Dentoni et al., 2019) and one of the most common ways of promoting 
innovation and entrepreneurship due to its high efficiency, according to Luc et al. (2002). Spin-offs promote the 
transfer of technology, that is, the transfer of knowledge to the market, according to Mustar et al. (2006). This 
knowledge can originate in an institution of science, technology, and innovation when it is called an academic spin-
off; or a company established in the market, receiving the corporate spin-off name (Luc et al., 2002). 
 
The academic spin-off occurrence is related to the triple helix model proposed by Etzkowitz (2003), which discusses 
the relationship between the company, government, and university to promote innovation. Academic spin-offs are the 
results of these relationships, constituting the economic exploitation of knowledge acquired, developed, or elaborated 
in an academic environment, according to Karnani (2012). 
 
The academic spin-off assumes an important role in the economic and social development of a region, according to 
Asterbo and Bazzazian (2011) and Montiel-Campos (2018). However, even with universities' importance for academic 
spin-offs, little has been documented on how this relationship is or should be (Bezerra et al., 2017). Recent studies 
suggest that ""different attitudes and support-practices of universities not only affect the propensity to spin-off or the 
rate of new business creation, but they play an important role in shaping the spin-off behavior and consequently in

Abstract 
 
The car industry in the Philippines has been booming for the last five years. The country ranked ninth in the largest 
number of registered passenger cars across the Asia-Pacific region, and in 2019 sold around 273.4 thousand vehicles. 
Relative to this, local customers pay an average of 1.0 to 1.3 million Philippine pesos for a motor car.  The company 
in the study is an automobile assembly plant, responsible for sales and distribution of automobiles and parts locally, 
and in other ASEAN countries. This research was conducted to find out, what affects the cycle time of returnable 
packaging logistics materials. The study employed primary and secondary data. Primary data were obtained through 
the deployment of the survey questionnaire, which was based on the Cycle-Time Improvement Guidebook – 
Partnering for Total Quality by Kanagal (1992); secondary data were provided by the company information 
system.  Respondents of the survey were one hundred and sixty-one (161) team members, from manager to interns, 
who were actively working at the time of the study at the Returnable Packaging Logistics Operation. Percentage and 
weighted mean were used to compute data.  Findings showed that the team members need periodic education through 
training and skills upgrade to align to Industry 4.0 concepts while providing process improvement activities to improve 
the operation’s cycle time. Furthermore, the current information system of the organization needs to be upgraded with 
technology that can provide a proactive approach to the operation.

1. Introduction  
 
1.1 Background of the Study 
 
Progress in communication and transport, combined with the ideology of free markets has given unprecedented 
mobility to goods, services, and capital.  With growing economic integration and economic interdependence among 
nations, a global marketplace emerged, fostering new competition requiring greater efficiency and genuine expertise 
in optimizing supply chains across all sectors. All business organizations are into cost efficiency and sustainable 
practices to remain competitive. Returnable packaging is a sustainable form of container that is both cost-effective 
and sustainable. It offers a lot of advantages in organizing an assembly plant’s complexity. The standardization that it 
offers, provides quick and easy performance of tasks, such as safe shipping of supplies and the ability to stack or 
gather packaging for safety and housekeeping. Various parts are prepared and used to assemble a car. And optimizing 
the reverse logistics techniques especially the deployment of returnable packaging in the parts delivery will 
significantly contribute not just to the financial improvement but also for the sustainable environment efforts by 
eliminating the waste on using single-use packaging. Just recently, the headquarters released the company goal in 
2020; two leading duties were to reduce cost and be an environment-friendly company together with its worldwide 
affiliates. The company implements the Just-in-Time (JIT) techniques in its operations. However, the organization 
still encounter problems in some Key Performance Indicators (KPI) such as 1) Return Punctuality referring to the gap 
in quantities on reverse logistics of returnable module and boxes, between the monthly plan and in actual return

830","that the speed of connection of the system is not sufficient to prevent workers from incurring unnecessary delay in 
their task, thereby, negatively affecting work efficiency.  
 
In terms of Accessibility, the team members’ assessment was 3.15 or Somehow Agree.  Many members replied that a 
good system can advise the user regarding complex problem.  However, members also indicated that current the 
information system was not readily accessible in the desired form when it was needed most of the time and there 
should be no connection breakdown.  
 
In terms of Accuracy, team members’ assessment was 3.15 or Somehow Agree. Members indicated that the current 
information system could not produce user-friendly summary, forecast data and they thought that insufficient or 
inaccurate knowledge usually led to low-quality decisions. Moreover, they assessed that the existing 
information/logistics monitoring system does not deliver information at the right destination and to the right person.  
 
In terms of Relevance, team members’ assessment was 3.04 or Somehow Agree.  According to the members, most of 
the time, the system could not produce feasible decision choices, could not decode abbreviations, short-hand, or 
acronyms contained in the information. Moreover, majority of the members somehow agreed that current information 
system could hardly provide applicable solutions that could contribute to the elimination of the problem; again, this 
supports the earlier findings that the available system could hardly support in providing solutions to problems, 
encountered by the operating unit.  
 
It can be concluded from the result of the study that team members of the Returnable Packaging Logistics Operation 
encounter problems with the current information system.  They found that information is not supplied real-time which 
is crucial in forecasting and planning. Information delay provided unreliable figures that were inconsistent with 
physical availability. Furthermore, members could not obtain the data needed to identify and solve problems.  It can 
be further analyzed that the system lagged in terms of features needed by a complex supply chain organization.  
 
6. Recommendations, Conclusion and the Way Forward  
 
In view of the discovery in the study, it is recommended that a re-orientation on all the procedures pertaining to 
returnable packaging be done. This will raise awareness on the part of all team members, after which, strict compliance 
may be enforced. It is also being recommended that the current information system be upgraded to a more responsive 
system; one that can provide real-time information, in harmony with physical inventory and one which is reliable for 
planning and forecasting. The Predictive Data Analytics Technology is one information system which may be 
considered to support the heavy requirements of the Returnable Packaging Logistics Operation. In order to prevent 
damages in the returnable packaging and sustain good performance, the following were recommended and currently 
installed; cushion on holding brackets to avoid module side panel damage and additional base support to avoid module 
bending damages as shown on figure 5 and a prevention holder to avoid swapping of Left-hand and Right-hand panel 
on figure 7. To prevent misplaced and loss of components, a component holder/hanger was designed as shown on 
figure 6 and sample photo on figure 7. Updating the labels of module types and maintaining the poka-yoke will 
improve the FIFO system.

This article attempts to describe challenges and opportunities for teaching work measurement in developing 
countries using the Japanese art of origami (paper folding). I initially present background information about 
the challenges of teaching work measurement to students from developing countries. Next, I suggest that 
origami-based instruction is related to Problem Based Learning (PBL) and can be used to teach work 
measurement, or other industrial engineering concepts, without depending on laboratories. Specifically, I 
present an origami-based project and its implementation by students from a Bolivian university. The basic 
strategy of the project is for students to put their hands to work to shape origami figures, and thus develop 
intuitions about work measurement for the calculation of average, normal, and standard times. Moreover, 
this strategy can also be used to teach students other industrial engineering concepts, such as learning 
curves, work standards, workplace cleanliness, poka-yokes, etc. As a consequence, origami-based 
instruction offers new opportunities for the development of practical, cheap, and environmentally friendly 
learning experiences. Therefore, industrial engineering students will discover the joy of product creation 
by their own hands, where the possibility of creation from a paper is infinite.

production times, etc. Moreover, the instructor can relate those results with a manufacturing operator’s performance 
due to idleness, boredom, trouble, difficulty, etc. 
  
Next, the students used the Westinghouse Performance Rating System to calculate the normal time per work element 
and standard times. The results are summarized in the next table (Table 4):

In the physical or virtual project presentation class, the instructor should discuss the meaning of students’ results. For 
example, in this particular student report, the algebraic sum showed that the operator was above the average 
(performance rating higher than 1). Moreover, the results showed that time allowances of the standard time are on 
average 6 seconds higher than the average time per working element. Moreover, the instructor should discuss the 
implications of these results in a manufacturing environment. For example, the inexistence of time allowances causes 
the dehumanization of the work environment and its negative effects on the operator’s wellbeing. Additionally, the 
instructor can discuss the effects of having badly calculated standard times and their relationship on workers' morale, 
productivity, and the country’s labor laws.   
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Generally, using origami in universities is far from a regular phenomenon, particularly because this art is not 
adequately marketed and many instructors are not aware of its implications for the development of learning 
experiences. Moreover, they tend to regard origami as child’s play. However, as this article showed, it helps to convey 
industrial engineering concepts without mentioning the joy of creating something yourself. Moreover, allow students 
to learn critical thinking, problem-solving and collaborative skills (PBL). Furthermore, solves a common problem in 
developing countries: lack of laboratories. Also, origami can be used to teach industrial engineering concepts in virtual 
education settings (e.g. during the COVID-19 lockdowns). Therefore, due to its visual and practical nature, origami-
based instruction helps students from developing countries to see more easily the connections between origami 
projects and industrial engineering concepts.  
 
Although origami-based instruction has many benefits, it can also be challenging for industrial engineering instructors. 
First, origami-based instruction requires a lot of time from instructors for decisions regarding the generalization of 
concepts from an origami project. Second, the instructor should ensure that the student does not walk away with an 
incorrect understanding of the concept under analysis. Third, the learning curve for origami-based learning depends 
on the instructor, until he gets used to origami-based instruction. Thus, instructors would dismiss origami-based 
instruction because is easier to teach from textbooks that do not use PBL. Therefore, preparing origami-based 
instruction will increase the time needed to prepare the class, and needs extra effort by the instructor.  
 
Despite the limitations mentioned above, in developing countries, origami-based instruction offers new opportunities 
for the development of practical, cheap, and environmentally friendly learning experiences. Specifically, from an 
attitudinal perspective, it is clear that the students change when working on origami-based projects. Over the last five 
years, I have been using origami-based instruction to teach work measurement (and other industrial engineering 
concepts). As a consequence, I found that student analytical capabilities have increased as a result of working with

methods development). Besides, certain industrial engineering concepts (e.g. learning curves, work standards, 
workplace cleanliness, poka-yokes, etc.) are best learned by students because they can use them in a new context, 
which is both meaningful and pleasurable. Moreover, as already mentioned above, in developing countries due to the 
lack of laboratories and resources, this practical learning context generally is absent in actual industrial engineering 
courses. Also, concerning the creative aspect of origami, the mixture of forms and colors seems to have enabled 
students to grow their esthetic sense, creativity, and artistic sensibilities, which is necessary for industrial design. 
Furthermore, the recycling of paper increases students' awareness of our climate and the environmental harm created 
by throwing to garbage used paper that can still be used to create origamis. Therefore, industrial engineering students 
will discover the joy of product creation by their own hands, where the possibility of creation from a paper is infinite.

Abstract 
 
The risks within school area deserve attention because it is an important place for the formation of citizenship and the 
intellectual development. One must be concerned about the way in which school spaces are used by the Educational 
Institution community. For instance, verifying whether the environment is well-ventilated and provides adequate 
furniture in the workspaces. Does an educational institution that is concerned with disseminating sustainability, also 
investing in the health and safety of its environments in order to be more secure? This article seeks to identify potential 
risks (environmental, behavioral and accidents), by elaborating Occupational Risks Map. Methodologically, this 
research is classified as qualitative, exploratory, by documentary research. This case study identifies risks in Brazilian","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 6-8, 2021 
© IEOM Society International 
Another important measure is Signaling, which fits the risks of accidents due to the lack of voltage indications in 
sockets and signs in the general light and power table and on the floors, next to the stairs. 
The least effective measure, according to HRC, and by no means the least, is the use of PPE, which are used when 
there is no way to eliminate or control the risk. The use of PPE is necessary in the presence of chemical and physical 
risks, as lab coats, masks, glasses, noise mufflers and safety shoes must be used to handle chemical reagents. 
As an academic research, this work made it possible to recognize and guide the factors, whether environmental, 
ergonomic and accidental, that generate risks and to characterize, even if superficial, the risks in a given work 
environment, through the structuring of the Risk Map in a study environment of an Educational Institution. It was 
important to understand how people, who answered the checklist, see the risks to which they are exposed. 
The mapping will enable the development of more prudent attitudes, based on the control measures identified, some 
still to be adopted and others already adopted, by the people who are most exposed, in the chemistry laboratory, to the 
graphically signaled risks. In professional terms, a more in-depth environmental assessment should be carried out in 
the future through the Environmental Risk Prevention Program (PPRA). 
6. Conclusion  
It is a fact that there are potential risks present in study environments. Throughout the professional life of the 
occupational safety technician, he must be prepared to manage risks in order to guarantee his safety and that of his co-
workers, as well as the environment in which he finds himself. Work safety applies to all segments / processes / 
environments. Evidently, each segment has its specific characteristics and risks, and exactly for that reason, each 
environment needs to be “taken care of”, like the study environments within a Teaching Institution. 
In this sense, the project was able to identify the different risks (environmental, behavioral and accidents), based on 
the elaboration of the Occupational Risks Map of the Chemistry Laboratory of Cefet/RJ. Bearing in mind that, the 
main function of the Risk Map is to signal the places where greater security is needed, alerting students and servants 
about the points where they should be more careful or even avoid. 
Another objective foreseen and achieved with the development of the project was to raise the necessary control and 
prevention measures for the selected environment, which in this case, stood out those of Replacement, Engineering 
Control, Signaling and the use of PPE. It should be considered that, currently, the risk control hierarchy, mentioned 
in this study, is addressed in the “new” NR-01 that deals with General Provisions and Risk Management, item 1.4.1, 
letter g, when it comes implementation of preventive measures, in order of priority. 
Some Regulatory Norms related to the elaboration of the Risk Map were also addressed, such as NR-05, which says 
that it is up to CIPA to do it and NR-09, which talks about the Environmental Risk Prevention Program (PPRA) and 
its objective of preserving the health and integrity of workers. NRs establish minimum protection requirements in the 
workplace, in order to prevent occupational accidents and diseases, preserving the health and safety of the community 
of the educational institution in question. 
Therefore, considering the importance that Cefet/RJ has been giving, through the development of extension and 
scientific initiation projects, in the dissemination of sustainability, especially when incorporating social, 
environmental and economic values and guiding principles of environmental strategies, both in disciplines taught as 
well as in the management of their physical structures; it is believed that the educational institution can invest in the 
health and safety of its environments so that they become more harmonious and safe, thus preventing potential risks. 
Considering the contributions of this research, how much: (i) the employee / administrative technician will feel more 
valued and tends to be more motivated at work, and yields more in the performance of the function; (ii) to the teacher, 
it will lead to a better quality of life, as well as a better condition for transmitting the content to students; (iii) students, 
more efficient learning and with lower risks; (iv) for the school, better results in school evaluations and reduction in 
the number of licenses of its professionals.

Abstract 
Oil & gas production is intensive cost activity due to the high cutting-edge technologies and energy requirements. In 
addition to the global continuous increase in power demands and due to the correlation of oil prices with global events 
which makes the price vulnerable to rapid fluctuation; most oil and gas companies tend to increase the production for 
the same oil field above the initial forecasting limit to increase the total profit in terms of monetary value during the 
oil wells’ life. Nevertheless, the oil overproduction has negative impacts on the company main assets such as wells 
equipment damage, high wells depletion rate, high power consumption, high wastewater, low product quality and 
adverse environmental impact; which will make the operation and maintenance cost to be much higher than the 
production increasing revenues. As the Lean management system concepts and tools are well known in the oil and gas 
industry and already in use in several operations improvement projects. So, in this research, a new model is suggested 
to be readily used by any oil and gas company to solve the problem by using Lean concepts and tools such as Value 
stream mapping “VSM”, Value Analysis, Method Study and Analytic Hierarchy Process “AHP” to eliminate wastes 
and concentrate the main values of the operations that lead ultimately to an acceptable increase in profits while not 
causing the mentioned overproduction problems. 
 
Keywords 
Lean, Overproduction, Production Scenario, Value Stream Mapping. 
 
1. Introduction. 
Most oil & gas production companies tended to increase their oil and gas production much higher than the initial 
forecasting limits, this case had been known as oil overproduction (Maugeri 2012) the reasons behind this 
overproduction are. 
1- Exploration Success Levels in Searching for and producing oil is Less Than 30% (Prince and de la Harpe 
2015) which makes the oil joint ventures always a Risky business due to uncertainty, oil and gas companies 
are one of the big 5 industries with the most bankruptcy filling in the last year 2020 (SHEN 2020). 
2- The sudden changing world oil price has a tremendous effect on the oil and gas companies economy. In 
April 2020, the price of the main U.S. oil benchmark fell to about $30 below zero (Reed and Krauss 2020), 
which underscores the oil and gas industry’s economic risk as the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic 
decimates the world economy. 
3- Oil production expense recovery or the Break-Even point is a long-term process that can be reached 10 
years in some mega projects and the total production period can reach 50 years or more (D. Babusiaux 
(IFP) 2007). The oil and gas companies tend to increase investments gradually as the price of crude oil 
increases, but once the new investments are started, they are very difficult to stop, even when consumption 
and crude oil prices suddenly collapse. especially when hundreds of millions of dollars have already been 
spent (Maugeri 2012). 
4- Contractual commitments are made by the oil companies with the countries owning the deposits, which 
often make it difficult to block or reduce the spending. Indeed, these commitments demand heavy 
economic penalties or even revocation of the concessions granted by the host government if, by pre-
established dates, the agreed number of wells and the needed infrastructure are not realized, and initial 
production is not achieved (Hutabarat 2015).

Abstract 
The analysis and identification of the best choices based on different criteria and alternatives is a difficult task, the 
results affect directly the achievement of the organization’s objectives. In this sense, rigorous approaches of Multi-
Criteria Decision Methods (MCDM) assist decision makers in sorting and selecting the best alternatives. Widely used 
on the solution of complex problems, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) is a decision-making tool that enables 
networking and calculates relationships between different network elements. This paper aims to present the ANSPI 
software developed in JavaScript language with the purpose of assisting in the use of ANP for complex decisions. 
Related work and tools are presented in order to identify advantages and difficulties. The tool has intuitive features 
and an easy-to-use interface, allowing multiple criteria and alternatives, and creating the representation of a networked 
system that considers interdependencies, feedbacks and complex relationships between different network elements. 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
Crucial to organizational competitiveness, decision-making must consider different criteria and alternatives to select 
the option that provides the best benefits to the organization (Czekster et al. 2019a). Multi-Criteria Decision Methods 
(MCDM) (Zavadskas et al. 2014) or Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) (Norheim 2018) are techniques that 
help managers to structure and choose the best solutions for problems involving different criteria and alternatives 
(Wang and Le 2019). It is noteworthy that the rigorous structuring of MCDM provides a complex approach to 
decision-making management, providing greater clarity about the problem studied, and is very indicated to treat 
problems with a high degree of complexity (Cohen et al. 2019). Given its advantages, the application of multi-criteria 
decision-making techniques has a growing and significant interest from researchers and scientists from different fields 
of study (Behzadian et al. 2010) with the purpose of assisting in decision making through classification, ranking and 
selection of the best alternatives (Kheybari 2020). 
Over the years, different multi-criteria methods to support decision making have been developed, such as AHP 
(Analytic Hierarchy Process) (Saaty 1991; Ishizaka and Labib 2011; Ho and Ma 2018), ANP (Analytic Network 
Process) (Saaty, 1996; Sipahi and Timor 2010; Chen et al. 2019), TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by 
Similarity to Ideal Solution) (Yoon and Hwang 1995; Behzadian et al. 2012; Salih et al. 2018), PROMETHEE 
(Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations) (Brans et al. 1986; Behzadian et al. 2010; 
Peterková and Franek 2018), MAUT/MAVT (Multi-Attribute Utility/Value Theory) (Dyer 2005; Allah 2019), 
MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) (Costa and Vansnick 1999; 
Marcelino 2019), ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) and variants (Current 2013; Govindan and 
Jepsen 2016), and VIKOR (Multi-criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution) (Opricovic 1998; Mardani et al. 
2016; Gul et al. 2016), among others. 
Multi-criteria decision-making methods are being used in several organizations, industries and universities worldwide 
as a decision-making support tool, helping managers in choosing alternatives that increase productivity and reduce 
costs and raw materials (Czekster et al. 2019b). Considering the importance and impact of decision making in

Abstract 
The release of toxic effluents into water bodies over the past few decades have upsurged, making access to 
drinkable water difficult. Water is the most sought-after resource for sustaining not only humans but wildlife and 
aquatic life and is imperial for economic growth and development. Rapid industrialisation, agricultural expansion 
as well as inconsiderate human activities are some of the factors liable for the present increase in water pollution 
and water insecurity plaguing the 21st century. In a bid to address this challenge, conventional water treatment 
methods like membrane filtration, chemical coagulation, activated carbon adsorption, etc., have been 
implemented. Consequently, the limitations resulting from these conventional methods in terms of their limited 
active sites, low sorption capacity, lack of selectivity, and short adsorption to regeneration cycle, has led to the 
unfolding of innovative, cost-effective, ecologically sustainable and efficient wastewater treatment technologies. 
Among these technologies, nanotechnology and biotechnology have separately played significant roles. This 
review is centred on nano-based absorbents materials used in wastewater and effluent treatment.

1. Introduction  
Water is a valuable and finite earth resource which occupies roughly 71% of the Earth's surface (An & Springer, 
2020). It is one of the most important resources for preserving and sustaining human, animal and aquatic life. The 
global need for fresh and affordable water is on the increase because of the increase in population growth, 
urbanisation, climate change, water quality deterioration and rapid advancements in the industrial and agricultural 
sectors (Ali & Aboul-Enein, 2004). The provision of potable water to match human needs is a huge challenge of 
the 21st century. Reports show that roughly ten to twenty million people die yearly due to waterborne diseases 
(Malik et al., 2012). The World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF in 2017 recorded that over 785 million 
people still lack basic access to reliable water services (World Health Organization & UNICEF, 2017). Access to 
safe, clean water is extremely vital for economic growth and development, as water is a lifeline for all forms of 
life on earth and is gotten from two predominant sources namely groundwater like water from wells and borehole 
water and natural surface water such as rivers, streams, oceans, freshwater lakes,  etc., (Bej et al., 2020).  
Generally, wastewater is a by-product generated from activities performed domestically, commercially, 
industrially or agriculturally, and from sewer infiltration or storm water/surface runoff (Tilley et al., 2008). The 
characteristics of wastewater are dependent on its source. As a result, wastewater can be grouped as domestic, 
industrial and municipal wastewater, which are respectively generated from households, industries and 
communities (Maity et al., 2020). Wastewater can also be categorised as black water, greywater and yellow water

Abstract 
The current outbreak of the Coronavirus diseases that have constituted a global issue with its adverse effects upon 
the world economy, healthcare systems, human lifestyle, and educational system. Several thousands of lives have 
was; numerous business establishments have folded up. This disease outbreak has been accompanied by a high 
mortality rate and loss of employment across the nations of the world. Several challenges have arisen from the 
recent epidemic of coronavirus pandemic. Over the years, nanomaterial has been used considerably in address the 
numerous clinical and health system challenges. This paper aims to carry out a comprehensive and systematic 
review of existing literature, investigates how nanomaterial and nanotechnology can aid in addressing the 
challenges of this outbreak and the current mitigation approaches. In this study, we explore the role of 
nanomaterial in addressing the challenges: supply of personal protective equipment, reliable clinical diagnostic, 
vaccine development, and therapeutic drugs. Covid-19 trial affords nanomaterial with the vast opportunity to

1. Introduction 
The current outbreak of the Coronavirus disease has constituted a global issue with its adverse effect upon the 
world economy, healthcare systems, human lifestyle, and educational system. Several thousands of lives have 
been lost; numerous business establishments have folded up. This disease outbreak has been accompanied by a 
high mortality rate and loss of employment across the nations of the world (Tsatsakis et al., 2020). As established 
via various researches, the transmission of this virus is through airborne droplets and from surface and skin 
contamination of airborne droplets. Besides, it's essential to note that it can as well be transmitted through direct 
inhalation, from hand to the nasal area and surface- to-hand to nasal area and other visual exposure channels 
(Semple & Cherrie, 2020). 
 
The Covid-19 disease infection often attacks the immune system and affect the aged and persons suffering from 
life-threatening diseases such as hypertension, kidney-failure cancer, heart failure. Hence, a daily increase in the 
number of people that are infected and died by Covid-19. This has necessitated the need not only for prevention 
but also for the control of the spread of this disease and, above all, to save human lives (Aydemir & Ulusu, 2020). 
Several years of research have shown that nanomaterials have been applied in the detection, prevention, and

thermodynamic instability, though it is a slow process and complicated to an extent. Dynamic light scattering is 
employed in estimating the sample size of the distribution through the drug delivery system (Khan et al., 2012). 
 
4. Justification 
Nanomaterials have found applications in various disciplines such as healthcare, biomedical, physics, electronics, 
and energy. Several diseases (such for instance Cancer, Tuberculosis, Parkinson and Alzheimer's diseases) and 
neuro disorders have been treated through the application of nanomaterial and nanotechnology, for instance. The 
unique properties of nanomaterial have led to the fast growth of nanotechnology in developing Nano based 
products and devices. The current pandemic of Covid-19 presents numerous challenges to humanity. In addressing 
these challenges, some preventive measures have been recommended. Yet to be explored is the role of 
nanomaterial and its applications in mitigating the spread of Covid-19. These materials offer numerous 
advantages, owing to its exceptional properties (surface-volume ratio, effective virus inhibition, molecular 
interaction, and particle size). The future of medicine lies in the multi-functionality and dimensionality of 
nanomaterials. There are several ongoing Nano based research geared towards addressing the challenges of Covid-
19. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The synergy between nanomaterial and Covid-19 has revealed prospective results for an improved healthcare 
system. Nanomaterial applications in health care delivery seem to be drawing the attention of several researchers 
and forming changes in approach in addressing the current pandemic challenges. Remarkably, some of these 
materials are utilized for clinical, prevention, therapeutic interventions in the treatment of viral infections. 
Nanomaterials have considerably enhanced the fabrication of personal protective equipment such as face shield 
and mask respirators, gloves, surgical gowns, and test kits. Furthermore, due to their physicochemical properties, 
these materials are used for clinical diagnostics, therapeutic purposes, and vaccine development. However, 
significant progress has been achieved in furthering the prospect of nanomaterials in healthcare delivery. This 
recent pandemic affords nanomaterials vast opportunities in addressing its challenges. Nevertheless, the issue of 
toxicity remains a significant concern over the years, thus impeding the approval of relevant regulatory agencies. 
Additional studies are required to understand fully the toxicity impact and likely biomedical complications of 
these materials with a notion to address this issue.

Abstract 
 
The construction projects are carried out to develop the infrastructure, building and services as part of the development 
of any country. The construction projects which were carried out in UAE before faced several problems and most 
notably cost and time overruns. This sometimes leads to the disputes and dissatisfaction among stockholders. Hence, 
there is a need for a study to investigate the same and try to apply the concept of ‘best value’ in order to improve the 
success of public construction projects. This will be achieved by the concept of ‘best value’ in order to facilitate a 
clear appreciation and understanding of the concept, articulate the scope of the concept of ‘best value’ as 
conceptualized within construction project management and articulate, identify and categorize the concept of ‘best 
value’ within the United Arab Emirates complex public sector. Therefore, this research propose research methodology 
for developing an assessment model for outcomes based best value using Multi Criteria Decision Making tool to 
prioritize the most important criteria. Further studies will follow this research to entirely develop a model according 
to proposed research methodology.

1. Introduction  
 
The use of different definitions for projects also extends to the academic and professional literature. From an academic 
standpoint, Turner and Müller (2003 p.7) introduced a definition of project which is : “project is a temporary 
organization to which resources are assigned to undertake a unique, novel and transient endeavour managing the 
inherent uncertainty and need for integration in order to deliver beneficial objectives of change”. Without doubt, 
projects are particularly important form of temporary organization. The seminal papers by Lundin and Söderholm 
(1995) as well as by Turner and Müller (2003) have tied research on project management more closely to organization 
theory (Sankaran et al. 2017). Since, project research has not only become more theoretically sophisticated and 
methodologically pluralistic, but has raised hopes that it will eventually have an impact on organization and 
management research more broadly, not least because of its focus on issues of time and temporality (Bakker et al. 
2016). In addition, projects are mentioned as a set of tasks that are interconnected that essential to be implemented 
over a definite period and within assured cost (Andler 2016). It is seen that the shared themes of project’s definitions 
are that the project is agreed to be unique in its results, temporary in nature, has a definite starting and ending point, 
carried out to achieve a goal that is aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives and commitment to create 
value. From a professional perspective, according to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) (PMI

Abstract 
 
The Modernization of Undergraduate Education Program (PMG) in Brazil started in 2019 and it has 8-years 
long. This modernization program is supported by the Fulbright Commission in Brazil, the U.S. Embassy 
in Brasilia, and the Ministry of Education, through Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation 
of Graduate Education (CAPES) and National Council of Education (CNE). Eight different engineering 
undergraduate programs were selected in this first edition aiming the modernization of the engineering 
education in Brazil. One of the program objectives is making a strong collaboration network between USA 
and Brazil looking for improvements in undergraduate programs in engineering education and the 
international tendencies in engineering areas. In order to succeed and to strengthen the internationalization 
of Brazilian universities, the PMG will provide the resources to the mobility of Brazilian and U.S. faculty 
and Brazilian Ph.D students. Other objectives aim to promote the entrepreneurship, creativity, and 
innovation skills among engineering students. We understand these are competencies required by the 
companies to sustain competitiveness and to innovate in the market in a constant transformation. By this 
way, engineering schools need to generate new syllabus aligned to competencies of the present and the 
future and to put the engineering student in a leading role in the learning process, applying active learning 
methodologies as project-based learning, gamification, flipped learning and so on. These methodologies 
with the support of modern and digital educational technologies will bring the smart education to our 
context. Then new facilities as smart classrooms and smart environments are needed to promote the active 
learning methodologies and to deliver to the Smart Society better engineers with the properly competencies. 
Although, the competencies and skills assessments are not easy tasks. Faculty members are encouraged and 
trained to apply innovative assessment methods and tools to evaluate competencies and skills instead only 
a set of contents. Nevertheless, it is necessary to work in partnership with different levels of higher 
education, with the Society, and with the productive sector to understand and update the engineering 
syllabus to fulfill the professional requirements. Much of this may conflict with the federal educational 
rules, but innovative actions are outcoming from de PMG, so the national regulations around the Brazilian 
engineering education must be updated if the Brazilian engineering wants to have a leading position. Each 
of eight of the undergraduate programs has initial results about their Institutional Modernization Projects 
(IMP) that are outcomes from the first two years of the PMG. Some IMPs are running new curricula in their 
universities and launching online and hybrid programs whereas other are implementing active learning 
methodologies in the new smart classrooms. The partnerships between U.S. and Brazilian universities are 
becoming stronger and many initiatives with the Society and the companies have been increased also. Many

Abstract 
 
In recent years, voice analysis has been studied for the non-invasive evaluation of Parkinson 
patients. In this context, a Parkinson´s voice database has been built by an interdisciplinary team 
made up of neurologists, otorhinolaryngologists and speech therapists from Hospital Posadas and 
Hospital Rivadavia and coordinated by researchers from Universidad Nacional de La Matanza 
(UNLaM). Voice samples were recorded during 2019 at a sound laboratory in Hospital Rivadavia 
which had been equipped by UNLaM and conditioned by a sound technician and a speech 
therapist. Parkinson patients were selected and scheduled to participate in a circuit that included a 
neurological assessment with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), voice 
recordings and a vocal cord endoscopy. Such investigation was approved and supervised by 
Hospital Rivadavia Ethics´ Committee Ethics. The voice database includes voice simples of 55 
(24 female and 31 male) Parkinson patients. In addition, voice samples from 64 non- Parkinson 
participants were obtained under the same conditions and protocol. Preliminary results from the 
database show differentiation between Parkinson and non- Parkinson participants, though 
parameters and methods to synthetize differences are still pending.  Parkinson patients´ age range 
between 38 and 79 years (mean age: 64), and disease duration varies from 1 to 16 years (mean: 6 
years). General results in terms of vocal cords condition and hoarseness are remarkable when 
compared with healthy participants. The collaborative work from this interdisciplinary group will 
provide a useful, easy to use, low-cost tool for Parkinson patients´ follow-up.

Abstract 
 
With their flexible structures that can easily adapt to change, start-up companies have become the cornerstone of the 
entrepreneurial ecosystem in today's economy. In the economic competition between countries, start-up companies in 
the country are of great importance. When the related literature’s examined, it’s seen that Turkey has not been 
investigated in a satisfactory form in terms of the condition on start-up firms. Given the worldwide prevalence and 
importance of these firms, such research is considered essential for Turkey. The aim of this study is to present 
exploratory knowledge on start-up firms which has been established and operating in Turkey. Hence, 5504 start-up 
companies in Turkey are examined in terms of variables such as the sector in which they operate, investment types,  
and the demographics of investors. As a result of the study, As a result of the research, it was found that startup 
investors are mostly graduated from foreign universities, the number of male investors is higher than female investors, 
the number of startups has increased in the 2000s, there is a concentration of startups in the e-commerce and 
manufacturing sector, most of the startups continue to operate and majority of investment types are seed. The study is 
thought to be beneficial for all stakeholders from researchers to practitioners.

1. Introduction 
Startup concept is defined as a structure created to find a scalable and repeatable business model. In another definition, 
a startup is defined as a new formation with rapid growth capability, a new business model that can be preferred by 
the masses for investment purposes (Ries 2011). Merriam Webster Dictionary expresses the term startup as “a new 
business venture”, while the Oxford Dictionary expresses it as “a startup company”. In the Longman Dictionary, this

4. Discussion and Conclusion  
This study is intended to provide information on Turkey's startup ecosystem. In this context, the dataset consisting of 
5,504 startups established from 1984 to 2019 is examined. The purpose of the study is to obtain information that will 
provide a descriptive point of view on Turkey’s startup ecosystem. In this regard, the questions guiding the research 
are designed to clarify the nature and properties of startups and their investors who make up the ecosystem of Turkey.  
 
When the universities which startup investors graduated from are examined within the scope of the research, it is seen 
that most of the investors received education abroad. It is possible to think about the adequacy of higher education in 
Turkey on promoting and encouraging startup investment according to this result. On the other hand, the majority of 
startup investors who had higher education in Turkey got their degrees from public universities. It’s seen that the 
administrations of private universities need to think about their curriculum on catching the economic trends of era. 
Considering the compatibility of this new business model with the economic requirements of the age, it can be said 
that the Turkish higher education system should work harder to compete with its rivals.  
 
When examining participation in economic life in Turkey, it is a known fact that no inequality between the genders. 
It is seen that men are more involved in economic life than women. When the distribution of startup investors by 
gender is examined within the scope of the research, a suitable result is found for this situation. According to the 
results, the number of male investors is more than twice the number of female investors. Nowadays, it is very important 
for women to take part in working life as much as men. It would be useful for economic systems that encourage startup 
investments to consider creating conditions in favor of women. Having more women investors in the startup world 
will create an advantage for the economy and provide different perspectives in the sectors.  
 
Considering the number of startups established by years, it is striking that there has been a remarkable increase since 
the end of the ‘90s. Since 2005, there has been a steady increase in the number of startup companies established. As 
of 2010, it is seen that there has been a significant increase in the number of startups established. The stability in the 
number of startups established is promising considering the global and national economic crises experienced. As a 
matter of fact, these flexible and agile structures, which can adapt to variable conditions, make economies more 
resistant to crises. In the new economic order of the world, it is thought that countries with more startups will be more 
advantageous in competition.  
 
Considering the distribution of startup companies by sectors, the distribution is not very homogeneous. It is observed 
that there is a concentration in manufacturing, technology, trade and e-commerce sectors. This is not surprising, mainly 
given the nature of economy and human needs. However, it would be advantageous to become widespread with this 
innovative business model in different sectors. Businesses that adapt their organizational structures to the nature of

different sectors will have an important effect on the economic success and sustainability of these sectors. It may be 
beneficial to take this into account when designing investment incentive programs. 
  
The life course of established startup companies will be a very important indicator of the success of investment. 
Therefore, within the scope of the research, how many of the startups are dead and how many are alive is examined. 
It is quite remarkable and promising that the vast majority of startups that have been established are alive. However, 
it is noteworthy that the rate of startups acquired is very low. Considering the high rate of startups that continue to 
live, this situation can be considered as an indicator that companies exhibit performances satisfying investors. Of 
course it would be useful to take into account how many new investors existing startups can find.  
 
Finally, the distribution of startups by investment types is examined within the scope of the study. As a result of the 
examination, it has been observed that there is a great accumulation in the seed investment type. It is noteworthy that 
the pre seed investment type follows the seed investment type. The number of startups in the growth equity investment 
type is remarkably low.  
 
In this study, it is attempted to present descriptive information on the startup ecosystem of Turkey by examining 
startup companies established in the country. In this respect, it is thought that the research findings can be the basis 
for future studies. This study which designed to provide a better understanding of Turkey's startup ecosystem is a 
descriptive research. In future studies, it is thought that comparisons with other countries' ecosystems will be useful. 
Studies like this will shed light on countries understanding what they can do to improve their startup ecosystems.

Abstract 
 
The Circular Economy is an important alternative to capture environmental profit from polluters and increase the 
competitiveness of productive sectors. This study aims to analyse how the Circular Economy (CE) indicators can 
contribute to improving the sustainability of recycling aluminium beverage packages in the Brazilian scenario. A 
literature review was conducted about CE indicators in aluminium-recycling context and a set of CE indicators were 
found and criticized in the context of sustainability. According to results, beverage packages have alternatives to be 
more circular, with correct ways to measure improvements and develop the sector, decreasing environmental threats 
and increasing recycling content. This study provided information to the metal industry, metal users, and the 
recycling industry of aluminium beverage packaging in Brazil.

1. Introduction 
 
Metals are infinitely recyclable in principle, but in practice, recycling is often inefficient or essentially non-existent 
because of limits imposed by social behaviour, product design, recycling technologies, and the thermodynamics of 
separation (Reck and Graedel 2012). 
The aluminium is used in a variety of products due to its characteristics such as good formability and high corrosion 
resistance. In this context, the aluminium recycling industry has been expanded through the decades requiring 
management tools adaptations to this market segment. Therefore, the sustainable management of aluminium has 
become crucial to the exponential growth in global demand (Soo et al. 2018).

to be the fabric of the organization, not part of the fabric.” This quote suggests that quality must find new 
approaches for their study that go beyond traditional conceptualizations, such as the study of the culture of 
quality. Worldwide, there are a series of studies about the culture of quality. However, in Bolivia and South 
America, no studies have analyzed their determinants. Thus, our research surveyed 185 Bolivian managers and 
through the use of statistical modeling, we found that customer focus, quality vision, and quality values 
positively influence the culture of quality. Additionally, we developed a culture of quality index to rank the 
surveyed firms according to their score. We found that: (a) large firms; (b) firms that implemented quality 
standards; and (c) product manufacturing firms have the highest culture of quality scores. In contrast, (i) SME’s; 
(ii) firms that did not implement quality standards; and (iii) service firms showed the lowest culture of quality 
scores. Finally, we discuss the implications and strategies for Bolivian firms.

960",,"Every research has limitations, and our research is no different. One of the limitations of our research is related 
to the model itself. Specifically, our model has a low variance explained. Future studies can use structural 
equation modeling or other methodologies to confirm the relationships we found. Moreover, other researchers 
can use different scales for leadership and incentives to test whether their relationship with the culture of quality 
is statistically non-significant. Additionally, researchers from other South American countries can use our 
framework to test the culture of quality of the firms operating within their borders. 
 
Finally, our research shows that Bolivian and South American firms can evaluate their culture of quality to 
improve their global competitiveness. Firms should always remember that as Philip Crosby once said “Quality 
is the result of a carefully constructed cultural environment. It has to be the fabric of the organization, not part 
of the fabric.”

weakening with limited access. This paper aims to examine the Italian fusion food business's product 
development strategy during the pandemic to provide a descriptive overview of business opportunities for 
new business development. This study examines the product development strategy of Le Misure as a new 
business venture to analyze performance and business projections. A qualitative descriptive approach is 
used in this study with a case study on the Italian fusion food business in Indonesia. This study indicates 
that product development for new businesses can be developed according to consumers' needs during a 
pandemic. There is an opportunity to develop new businesses during this pandemic. This study focuses on 
analyzing cases of business performance and growth as a new business during a pandemic. This research 
has a significant contribution to business and entrepreneurship, where the results of this study are something 
new and have never been done before in similar businesses. This study's results can be used as 
recommendations for entrepreneurs and small businesses to stay positive in developing their business in a

The table shows details of products sold during the six-month period le Misure's business operates. This product is 
calculated based on the number of orders received when Le Misure sells with an open pre-order system. Based on the 
table, Lasagna is the product most in demand by buyers in the Le Misure business. Our seasonal product category in 
the form of hampers placed second with eleven products sold and followed by tiramisu cup, which became more 
popular by consumers than in box packaging. The next order occupied in sequence with the same number of sales are 
macaroni schootel and bolu potong delivered at Christmas 2020 with nine products sold. Other products that are still 
sold are some products made by Le Misure, such as Lapis Surabaya. Looking at the consumer response, the products 
that are often purchased already have good value in the market, and it will be better in the future if it can be 
appropriately re-developed. 
 
Based on the data above, Le Misure answers all the problems with a good score of measuring performance and relation 
to the product development. Even though this pandemic hit all businesses hardly, but Le Misure keeps sustain and 
exist in the market during the COVID-19. Le Misure can be one example that businesses can sustain during the 
pandemic and prove that product development and business creation have a good relation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Le Misure's marketing performance must be improved again the marketing activities that will be carried out in the 
future but see the customer retention figures are still quite good. Le Misure's sales volume performance is still good; 
the products that sell are still varied and have Italian characteristics. Based on the results of the analysis that has been 
done, Le Misure needs product development to survive in business competition. Le Misure's business can still develop 
well and maximally by developing its product line. Le Misure can grow as seen from a good increase in sales every 
month. This can prove that product, and business development can go hand in hand. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
challenges can be quickly passed by Le Misure. in conclusion, Le Misure's business can survive business competition 
in this COVID-19 era.  
 
Le Misure eventually changed the concept of Italian food to the concept of Italian fusion kitchen where Le Misure will 
sell products that can be done by the owner and the product is in demand by consumers, specifically those who still 
have elements of typical Italian cuisine. In the end, Le Misure developed by selling marble cake followed by sales, 
lapis Surabaya, butter cake, brownies, spaghetti brulee and naporitan. Le Misure currently has two product lines, sweet 
and savory, with ten product variants. Nevertheless, the addition of products in Le Misure business will continue to 
grow as the business grows and is accompanied by the development of packaging and product photos that are already 
more well conceptualized.

Abstract  
 
 
Business strategy is an essential factor in running a business and responding to challenges to survive and develop. A 
strategy's reliability will be tested when it is required to respond to an unexpected and rapid change such as the Covid 
19 pandemic. Many businesses have collapsed and cannot survive. This paper aims to analyze innovation value 
capability in investment company business strategies to achieve business performance. This study uses a case study 
approach to an application-based forex investment company that provides learning and investment services. The 
qualitative descriptive method is used to analyze the high performance and performance achieved by this company 
during the pandemic. This research's main finding is that high business performance can be achieved in extreme 
situations with value innovation capabilities implemented in a responsive business strategy. This high-performance 
achievement is a paradox in business conditions that are globally in a declining business condition. Research efforts 
point to business strategy and value innovation capabilities during the pandemic. This research is significant and has 
important values where this research proves that an entrepreneur's ability to be able to change and survive in difficult 
conditions becomes a turning point for achieving the best performance.

customer pain of frozen food during the covid-19 quarantine and make product design and packaging innovations 
following consumer expectations. Innovation Product Design is one strategy that allows companies to develop and 
survive during the Covid. This research uses an action research method with a qualitative descriptive approach to seek, 
find and create appropriate product design and packaging to solve customer pains. This study's results resulted in 
product design innovation and packaging for frozen food following consumers' expectations. This research's 
significance is the analysis of target customers pains during the quarantine period, which can be an opportunity for 
the frozen food business. This research's recommendation is product development for frozen food by exploring the 
culinary treasures of the archipelago to add product value through packaging and product design innovation.

Abstract 
 
Since 1971, the impact of population growth on the environment has been a topic of interest. This growth has been a 
degrading factor of environmental quality: as the pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment increases, 
air and water pollution, along with the amount of solid waste generated also increases. The circular economy is 
considered as a potential solution, oriented to protect the environment without becoming an obstacle to economic 
growth.  
 
To make an effective transition towards a circular economy, we must have the responsibility and active participation 
of all the stakeholders involved, including customers. In this work, we seek to develop an agent-based model to 
describe and analyze an environmental awareness system in a population, whose behavior is based on an indicator 
that can change by agent’s interaction and modify its consumption habits.  
 
After the model validation process, its results are analyzed to understand how the environmental awareness level, 
consumption habits, and social skills of each individual, can influence the average environmental awareness level of 
a heterogeneous population, which makes simple the identification of emerging behaviors and the forecasting of the 
potentially recyclable waste according to the quality in the separation at source.

Abstract  
 
This study examines the level of utilization of information technology in the education industry through perceived 
complexity. The study was conducted on 75 human resources who have IT backgrounds in higher education. Data 
from respondents were obtained through quantitative questionnaires and processed through SPSS to assess the 
perceived value. The research findings conveyed that the level of indicators in the perceived complexity that needs 
attention is difficult to understand from a business perspective and difficult to apply from a technical perspective. The 
study results provide an overview of the education industry in Indonesia in early learning the utility level of HR 
technology so that the implementation of technology will be able to support organizational performance. 
 
Keywords 
Technology, Perceived Complexity, Organizational Performance.  
 
1. Introduction 
Information technology is believed to be an important support for organizational growth so that investment is made 
by organizations to support organizational performance (Chouinard, Wandschneider, and Paterson 2016). All parts of 
the organization use information technology to accelerate performance and provide the best performance in operations 
(Cai, Chen, and Bose 2013). In the highest position, information technology is used as a tool to support decisions for 
entrepreneurs (Freihat 2012; Setiadi et al. 2018). The use of information technology is tailored to the needs of the 
company, from the operational level to the decision-holder level. This adjustment is considered important so that the 
implementation of information technology is by company goals and supports organizational performance (Hikmawati, 
Alamsyah, and Setiadi 2020; Zhao et al. 2014). The development of the company provides new opportunities for the 
use of more complex information technology. This is associated with the many functions of technology to support 
organizational performance (Alamsyah et al. 2019). However, some obstacles coexist with the implementation of

1004","Through understanding the acceptance of human resources in information technology, management, in this case, 
universities, can prioritize evaluation priorities. So that the implementation of information technology is in line with 
the vision and mission of higher education and provides innovation value for the organization. This research provides 
value for management in Indonesia's education industry in the implementation of information technology as part of 
innovation and support for organizational performance. Through the findings in this study, it is hoped that information 
related to perceived complexity faced by HR in organizations can be input before implementing technology. In the 
future, there will be many challenges faced by organizations related to information technology, so that internal and 
external support from the company is needed. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This research aims to examine perceived complexity in the education industry for evaluating the utilization of 
information technology. The main goals of the organization can be achieved in improving organizational performance 
because of information technology support. The study results found that there are five indicators studied in perceived 
complexity, namely difficulty to understand and implement technology with a business and technical perspective, also 
difficulty to adopt the technology. The research findings conveyed that perceived complexity is dominated by two 
sides, namely, difficulty understanding from a business perspective and difficulty implementing from a technical 
perspective. Meanwhile, the thing that is not the main issue in perceived complexity is difficult to adopt. The research 
findings can be used as input for the education industry's most common organizations in evaluating the implementation 
of information technology. This research does not discuss the impact of perceived complexity technology on 
organizational performance so that the next research position becomes a recommendation to be continued.

Abstract  
Massive and global changes related to the Covid 19 pandemic have forced the industry to divert some of its activities 
through online media. The conventional activities of the business must be transferred online, including branding and 
marketing. Digital branding and online marketing must be optimized to make a business survive and grow. This 
research aims to be able to answer this online revolution phenomenon by implementing the right business strategy for 
small businesses. This research focuses on case study analysis on online marketing strategies and digital branding 
applied by the contemporary beverage business with the Qju brand. This study concludes that the communication 
strategy on online media carried out by Qju includes four things: product information, services, purchases, and 
advertising. The communication strategy has been proven to be effective with increased sales and favorable customer 
growth rates. The redundancy, informative, persuasive, and educational communication methods implemented have 
proven to invite positive responses from target consumers. Digital branding carried out by Qju through online media 
can be successful with increased customer growth rate, customer satisfaction index, and customer retention rate.  This 
study's results are significant and can be used as recommendations for other small businesses to maximize their 
marketing strategy through online media and use the right communication methods to increase the digital branding of 
their business products.

1011","5.4 Validation 
 
In conducting the research validity test, according to qualitative research, the authors use triangulation techniques. 
According to Sutopo, 2006, triangulation is the most common way to increase data validity in qualitative research 
(Sutopo, 2006). Norman K. Denkin, quoted by Mudjia Rahardjo (2010), defines triangulation as a combination of 
methods used to study interrelated phenomena and different points of view. Researchers use this type of triangulation 
of data sources. Researchers have to dig up the truth of information through methods and sources of data collection 
through questionnaires and other data such as sales data. In this way, it will produce data that will provide different 
insights regarding the phenomenon under study. 
 
According to the analysis of business performance dashboard data and questionnaire results, on average, the use of 
communication strategies and communication methods in online marketing by Qju has been effective. Sales from July 
to December 2020, the graph goes up and down. The highest sales chart was in July with 86 small and 55 medium-
sized products sold. This increase was due to customer reviews on their social media accounts regarding new products 
with strawberry and blueberry variants that were launched in June 2020. The results of reviews or consumer 
satisfaction with Qju products were included in the highlight feature on Instagram so that other consumers who visited 
Qju accounts could see, and that is what influences the perception and desire of other customers to buy Qju products. 
Besides, communication strategies such as the active founders upload Instagram feed content with attractive captions 
also encourage consumer interest to make product purchases. The uploaded content is knowledge about the benefits 
of strawberries and blueberries. Other content is in the form of product photos with product specifications captions. 
Also, in July, the founder regularly uploads Instagram stories about pre-orders by including contact information. 
Instagram Stories trigger consumers to purchase products. In July, Qju also conducted an endorsement to one of the 
influencers who proved to be effective in increasing the number of followers of more than 200 accounts and 
influencing the percentage of the outer circle who made product purchases. 
 
6. Conclusions And Suggestions 
6.1 Conclusions 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has had many impacts, including the culinary business. Business actors must start adopting 
new habits. In particular, Qju needs to adapt to the circumstances in which people start buying food and drinks online 
and have public awareness in choosing healthy and hygienic food and drinks. Qju is also required to pay more attention 
to technology and online digital marketing to reach consumers online. At the beginning of the pandemic, Qju began 
to activate social media for social interaction, such as promoting and delivering information through Instagram stories 
and feeds. Which was before the Covid-19 pandemic, all of this was mostly done by mouth to mouth. Various kinds 
of promotions and online marketing programs have also become more realized since this pandemic. Moreover, the 
results proved to be sufficient to increase the number of followers, the number of outer circle buyers, and profile visits. 
 
Because at this time, business actors focus on online sales, Qju is researching how marketing communication strategies 
are carried out to attract consumer buying interest, and it can be concluded that: 
1. The strategy for using online media by Qju includes information on products, services, purchases, and 
advertising in a digital format. The four strategies have been analyzed proven to be effective in influencing 
consumer buying interest. So far, product information is the most effective strategy for using online media 
of the three other strategies. 
2. The communication methods used by Qju in attracting consumer buying interest are redundancy, informative, 
persuasive, and educational methods.The four methods used are proven to be successful in inviting positive 
responses from potential customers. 
 
6.2 Suggestions 
 
Suggestions that can be given from the results of this study are to maximize online media with strategies and 
communication methods that are appropriate and effective in the target market. Seeing the results of product 
information getting the highest percentage in helping to influence consumer buying interest, companies can focus 
more on including information about products in this marketing communication. This can be in the form of photo 
uploads with description specifications such as price, product characteristics, product variant availability, pre-order 
date, and so on.

1018","Companies can also focus more on service. This service is divided into two, the first is service during sales or during-
sales service. Friendly, nimble service and helping consumers while making purchases is one of the things that 
influences the desire to buy from consumers. The second service is a technical post-sales service or after-sales service. 
 
For buying decision , it is important for companies to also cooperate with certain e-commerce or platforms. In addition 
to making it easier for customers, making it easier for sellers to obtain consumer data, expanding the target market. 
 
For the advertising or advertising section, companies must be able to determine the proportion of ad content that 
matches the target market. This program can be in the form of giveaway, discount, collaboration, and others. These 
programs will increase consumer loyalty and influence consumer buying interest. 
 
In addition, here are some communication methods that are effective and applicable for Qju business. Use redundancy 
methods or repeat messages to consumers so that consumers can remember the information, especially promotional-
related content. Informative methods such as contact information, pre-order dates, product specifications, and clear 
promo terms help consumers get information for purchasing decisions. Persuasive methods can be applied to writing 
interesting captions or uploading eye-catching posts. Educational methods that can be applied to attract buying interest, 
for example, the founder gives an opinion on the right time to eat dessert to prevent the body from fattening, and so 
on.

Abstract 
 
Optimizing a shaft machining process is critical to reaching the quality requirements specified by the customer. Thus, 
the study's objective is to define the appropriate parameters to optimize the axle machining process used in a didactic 
experiment in a laboratory of manufacturing processes in a public university. For this, an Experimental Project was 
carried out to reach the best fit to minimize the shaft shape error and improve the process quality. To develop this 
study, the experiment design is based on the 2K factorial design methodology and ANOVA analysis. The findings 
show that the shape error is related to the interaction between feed rate, depth of cut and tool tip radius.

1. Introduction 
 
Due to the complexity, high level of abstraction, and different mathematical techniques to be explained, teaching 
and learning in engineering courses are challenging tasks (Chowdhury et al., 2019). Given this context, it is important 
to integrate theory into practice through laboratory manufacturing experiments (Zhu, 2020). Didactic training using 
the machining process needs optimization because the resources are increasingly decreasing in education, making it 
difficult to teach engineering courses effectively (Chowdhury et al., 2019). Also, companies' resources are restricted, 
so students are prepared to optimize resources for the job market. 
Following Ribeiro and Caten (2014), Experimental Project methodology is strongly supported by statistical 
concepts. It seeks to optimize the planning, execution, and analysis of an experiment that improves systems 
performance. Within this theme, a method to plan these experiments aiming at optimization are the 2K factorial design, 
whose objective is to perform tests with each of the possible combinations. Based on this, we could establish and 
analyze the main interaction effects of the parameters, so that we may point out the best experimental conditions of 
the manufacturing process (Galdámez, 2002). 
Therefore, Experimental Project was carried out with the objective of defining the appropriate parameters of the axle 
machining process used in a didactic way by a laboratory of manufacturing processes. With this, we could plan our 
experimental project and conclude about the best process fit, so that the shaft shape error is minimized and, thus, the 
process quality is improved (Ribeiro and Caten, 2014).  
Thus, the study was carried out at a Public University in southern Brazil, more specifically in Manufacturing 
Processes laboratory, which offers services that comprise the machining area, such as milling, turning, drilling, among 
others. We collected the sample according to the distribution of the Minitab Software. Considering the measurements 
of each combination of parameters, we could observe that this type of method was effective to determine the optimal 
adjustment to minimize the shaft shape error machined in the laboratory, which generated a rational use of the 
university resources and improved the teaching and learning process of engineering courses. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
 
The main objective of this study is to improve the quality of the machining process performed by the laboratory of 
manufacturing processes with the minimization of the shaft shape error. For this, some specific objectives were 
followed as shown in Figure 1.

3776","Figure 5. Optimization graph 
 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
 
According to the graph presented in Figure 5, we verified that the optimal fit for the studied process is feed rate at 
the low level (10 mm/min), depth of cut at the low level (30 μm), and tooltip radius at the high level (3 mm). With 
this combination, the machined shaft shape error can be adjusted to 16 μm, thus minimizing the machining process’s 
quality problem. 
We suggest that other tests be performed with different values of parameters to establish a cycle of continuous 
improvement and to optimize the use of resources for this type of production. It is important to highlight that the 
analyzed context requires maximum resources optimization since it has little investment to produce the shafts, and the 
available resources are scarce. Therefore, this experiment can be considered quite relevant since it identified the best 
way to produce shafts aimed at teaching engineering undergraduates. Our study brought novelty regarding 
optimization parameters because other studies about didactic machining focus on developing a friendly framework 
and creating a module to facilitate the teaching and learning process (Bustamente et al., 2014).  Also, other authors 
explored the importance of didactic puzzle games in the learning process of machining, and they have already patented 
this idea (Serrano, 1994).  Thus, considering this context, if we join our findings with the previous literature about the 
theme, we observe that if we integrate optimal fit, simulation, new teaching frameworks, and puzzle games, for 
instance, the students could be beneficiated with a strong and wide learning experience.  Furthermore, even though 
our study has been applied in a public university, our findings could also be used in industry because the industry is 
also seeking to reduce their costs and to improve the use of resources. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
We sought to define the levels of shaft machining parameters that minimize the problem of shaft shape error. For 
this, we used a methodology of design of experiments, called factorial project 2k, specifically a factorial project 2³,  
and the ANOVA analysis. For this, we investigated three factors at two levels: feed rate (10 and 30 mm/min), depth 
of cut (30 and 50 μm), and tooltip radius (1 and 3 mm). We performed 16 trials (eight on each day), and we analyzed 
the combinations identified in the experimental matrix. 
Based on our data collection and analysis, we could identify the optimal fit of each factor level to minimize the shaft 
shape error. The finding showed that feed rate [mm/min]: 10 mm/min; depth of cut [µm]: 30 µm; tooltip radius [mm]: 
3 mm. 
Therefore, by adopting the indicated levels, we could minimize the effect of the shaft shape error, ensuring better 
quality to the machining process performed by the manufacturing process laboratory of a public university. Also, it is 
interesting to emphasize that the use of Experimental projects facilitates the analysis process since the way information 
is collected mitigates possible bias that may arise in the practical day-to-day. Another relevant point is that through 
this optimization, the resources used for the teaching and learning process in engineering courses are improved, 
increasing the effectiveness of teaching.

and rational use of resources. Also, it is interesting that the engineering students themselves replicate these 
experiments to propose better ways of using resources or even the study of other process parameters.

Abstract 
Detection tests for COVID-19 are important to mitigate its spread. However, it is not yet clear what are the best 
practices for its realization. This paper aims to propose best practices to avoid possible failures in the points of contact 
of the samples collection for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) process in an emergency 
department of a hospital for the care of patients who are suspected or diagnosed with the new coronavirus. For this 
purpose, we performed a process mapping of the RT-PCR collection process using the Service Blueprint tool to 
identify the points of contact between the patients and the hospital staff. Thus, we identified the possible failures in 
these points, with the process actors, and we prioritized them according to their perception about Gravity, Urgency, 
and Tendency matrix. Our results show that the most critical failures are related to the information and communication 
between the process actors and the patients. In this way, improvements were proposed related to the standardization, 
information material, continued training, development of specialized teams, creation of protocols, and use of 
information technology.

1. Introduction  
The second decade of the new millennium ends with a pandemic – declared by the World Health Organization – 
apparently begun in China, which transformed the facets of society (Qian and Fan, 2020). The new coronavirus 
COVID-19 affected life in general, imposing sanitary barriers and modifying many human habits in a short period. 
The pandemic unfolded into economic problems, but it also brought much more impact to health systems. For 
example, in Brazil, there is the Unified Health System (SUS) (Paiva and Teixeira, 2014), whose advent “increased 
access to health care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming 
increasingly privatized (Paim et al., 2011, p.1778)”. With the pandemic, the reasonably organized health system 
suffers from an abrupt increase in demand, especially in hospitals. One of the tests used for the detection of the active 
virus is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Particularly, in a study on the diagnosis of 
Influenza by RT-PCR in emergencies, Hansen et al. (2018) state that optimal patient management depends on the 
recognition of appropriate clinical symptoms by an experienced health professional and the availability of reliable 
diagnoses, with strong predictive values, capable of allowing management decisions to be made. The main figure of 
the pandemic is the patient who, as a client of the public health service, will be impacted by the new protocols of 
medical care for diagnosis. The improvements in the current care processes, or the inclusion of new and best practices, 
become fundamental approaches in crises, as they can bring numerous benefits, especially for patients and for public 
health. 
In health service processes, the patient's point of contact with the care environment seems to be essential elements 
of analysis to allow better management of services in crises scenarios. For this, the Service Blueprint presents as a 
good analytical tool to understand the participation of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection throughout the 
healthcare process. The Service Blueprint is one of the most used tools to manage service operations, being also used 
in the health area to clarify the functions and responsibilities of each team member, reveal problem areas, seek 
improvements, compare observed processes, as well as analyze interactions in processes (Chen and Cheng, 2012).

Abstract 
 
Innovation is the engine for economic development. The need for new products represents opportunities for countries 
with unique characteristics, such as Bolivia. The country's location in South America combined with dramatic 
variations in topography and climate result in a range of ecosystems. As a consequence, there is a rich variety of 
underexplored resources, such as native plants. No studies have considered their use for the innovation of new 
products. Therefore, we developed the formulation of a new liquor based on native plants from Bolivia. For the 
development: (a) we made a literature review of Bolivian native plants; (b) we optimized the liquor’s attributes through 
mixture design; (c) we used design thinking to understand consumers taste. The results suggest: (a) the combination 
of design thinking and mixture design allowed the successful development of a new liquor from 27 native plants; (b) 
the iterative nature of design thinking allowed the adaptation of liquor prototypes to consumer preferences; (c) market 
research found the prototype satisfied consumers. The development of this new liquor suggests that countries with 
rich and varied ecosystems offer new opportunities for innovative products. Combination of mixture design and design 
thinking offers new opportunities for new product development in combinatorial complexity.

1. Introduction 
 
Bolivia is a landlocked country with a colorful history, interesting customs, abundant biodiversity, and a diverse 
landscape. Its ecosystems and habitats vary from high plateaus and snow-capped mountains as high as 6,500 meters 
(21,500 feet) to forests and low-lying wetlands. Such various ecosystems help make Bolivia one of the world's most 
biologically rich nations. Particularly, this biological richness has given Bolivia a wide variety of native plants with 
unique properties and potential. For example, known vegetal species in Bolivia represent around 19% of the total 
worldwide diversity (surrounding 40,000 higher-level plants). Many of these plants have been used by generations of 
native Bolivians for subsistence and are part of their culture.  
 
To the best of our knowledge, there is still little scientific research about the use and applications of Bolivian native 
plants. For example, in the region, most of the available knowledge about native plants is attributed to 
the Kallawaya culture (Vidaurre 2006). Furthermore, few studies have gathered information about medicinal plants 
from the Andes and tropical regions from Bolivia (see Vidaurre 2006; Thomas and Vandebroek 2006). Available 
authors only make broad descriptions and applications of native plants. Moreover, their findings are limited to 
medicinal descriptions and anecdotal virtues without objectively analyzing their chemical properties or benefits. 
Further, their views and findings are limited only to ethnocultural use. Therefore, Bolivian native plants offer new 
academic and market opportunities for new product developments, that go beyond just its ethnocultural use.   
 
Our study's main contribution is that we propose the combination of two widely used methodologies for new product 
development: design thinking and mixture design. Our methodology combines the main strengths of both 
methodologies to develop new products with market-accepted features with high complexity. Specifically, design 
thinking allows to know and iteratively improve a product with market-oriented features, but without considering its

1034","5. Limitations and recommendations 
 
Every study has weaknesses, and ours is no exception. Among the limitations, is the limited sample size. Subsequent 
studies should consider larger sizes to obtain more accurate conclusions and inferences about consumer behavior. 
However, the minimum sample size used for the survey suggests that the results are generalizable to a larger 
population. We neglected a sizeable sample approach due to the prioritization of formulation under combinatorial 
complexity. Although DT does not require expensive testing, the container's shape and material labels were 
underexplored characteristics. Future studies could seek to reproduce our study with better equipment and more 
controlled conditions. Moreover, future research should try more precise colorimetric measurements.  In our study, 
due to economic constraints, we adopted a cheaper measurement technique. However, according to the literature, our 
method should not greatly differ from more complex measurement methodologies. Finally, future studies should 
investigate the chemical characterization of the final product bioactive profile. They should consider stability features, 
storage conditions, and preservation. Changes in physical properties are related to the secondary metabolites’ 
decomposition by enzymes and parameter changes should be controlled. Future studies should assess color, taste, 
odor, specific gravity, solid residue, viscosity, microbial content, chromatographic, and spectral characteristics of our 
final product. 
 
As our combined methodology and successful new product development have shown: “Innovation is taking two things 
that exist and putting them together in a new way” (Tom Freston, Co-founder of MTV).

Abstract 
 
Flexibility and Sustainability are two philosophies that the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) invested 
heavily in since the 21st century. This study identified the lack of empirical research investigating the relationship 
between flexibility and sustainability and their combined interactions with operational performance metrics. Very 
few studies investigated this relationship in limited depth and breadth. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the 
interaction between flexibility, sustainability, and their impact on operational performance in the United States (US) 
and European (EU) OEMs. Based on the contingency theory and resource-based view theory, a conceptual model 
linking flexibility, sustainability, and operational performance was developed and empirically tested. After 
reviewing previous literature and consulting academicians and practitioners experienced in the topic, a survey was 
developed. The survey was conducted with a total of 140 respondents. The respondents are managers at OEMs 
facilities in Europe and the US. The results indicated a significant and positive relationship between flexibility and 
operational performance, flexibility and sustainability, and sustainability and operational performance. The results 
also revealed that sustainability mediates the relationship between flexibility and operational performance. This 
study can help managers know what flexibility and sustainability practices optimize operational performance.

Abstract 
This paper aims to demonstrate an effective approach for improving process reliability within a flexible packaging 
manufacturing organization. As the need for efficient industrial processes grows globally, industries tend to seek 
robust methodologies to chart their path to business excellence in terms of quality products and services. This 
research is focused on DMAIC methodology for investigating the root causes of slitting machines, and to proffer the 
best solution to improve the process. A data collection plan which is based on the lowest-performing machines was 
obtained, followed by qualitative and quantitative process analysis to identify the potential cause(s) for the 
machines' low process reliability. Statistical tools were used to validate the potential factors that are most probably 
critical for the machine's performance. The analysis indicates that actual operating slitting speed was below standard 
speed due to the possibility of defective slit rolls, and the presence of flags on jumbo rolls that accounted for 20% – 
40% of the gross downtime. Employee’s inability to capture downtime was also identified as one of the critical 
factors affecting the performance of slitting machines. After implementing solutions, a 25% improvement in the 
process reliability was achieved without compromising the quality of the products.

1. Introduction  
Top-notch organizations worldwide have been pushing the boundaries of their processes to either set the pace or 
meet the benchmark in the industrial space. The globalization of markets, growth of customers' expectations, and 
widening competition in all spheres necessitate fulfilling customer's requirements who occupy the leading position 
on the market (Kostina et al. 2012). More recently, SMEs and local businesses have become more open to ensuring 
their processes achieve international standards while employing best practices in their businesses. Process efficiency 
can be increased by adopting the Six Sigma (SS) methodology. Defects can equally be reduced using the same 
approach and this will in no doubt improve the quality of products made to satisfy customers (Sudari et al. 2019).  
According to Raisinghani et al. (2005), this technique has become a prevailing method implemented by top 
companies during the third industrial revolution and capable of achieving a 99.9% quality level. The SS data-driven 
improvement cycle for stabilizing business process in manufacturing or industrial settings is the DMAIC, where the 
D represent-define, M represent-measure, A represent-analyze, I represent- improvement in operation and C the 
control process. This improvement strategy is applicable in virtually all sectors be it a product or service-based 
(Chakrabarty and Chuan 2007).

5. Conclusion 
This research presented a successful case study of PR improvements of slitting process in flexible packaging 
manufacturing by using the SS-DMAIC problem-solving methodologies.  After the investigation carried out in the 
analysis and improvement phases, the improvement project presented in this paper found that the machine speed, 
inaccurate downtime capturing, wastage regenerated, and interaction between the films and machine had a 
statistically significant impact on the PR of the slitting process. By considering these factors for improvement, the 
PR increased by 25%from a baseline of 28% to 35%, which exceeds the best historical performance of the 
machines. This project demonstrates the successful application of SS-DMAIC to industrial challenges, therefore, 
organizations that continue to embrace Six Sigma's continuous improvement culture increase their product quality, 
achieve customer satisfaction and reduce waste. Therefore, the paper can be used as a reference for managers to 
guide specific process improvement projects, in their organizations, similar to the one presented in this paper.

Abstract 
Quality improvement methodologies are important for efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity in diverse sectors. 
Six Sigma being a management technique has been widely utilized to improve quality in manufacturing and service 
systems. This research is focused at the systematic identification of opportunities for possible implementation in the 
manufacturing and service sector. Firstly, a deep appraisal was conducted with a focus on the introduction to six sigma 
and previous research on related philosophy. Secondly, the application of six sigma in service and product based 
system was investigated. Finally, Six Sigma was applied to solve real life problem, using data obtained from a food 
processing industry while recommendation was made using six sigma from the perspective of industry 4.0. This 
globally recognized technique requires strategic implementation for an operational and optimal outcome to achieve a 
reduction of cost, errors, time and quality improvement for customers’ satisfaction. The systematic study serves as a 
bird's-eye view for strategists and professionals in the manufacturing and service industries to help boost quality, 
productivity, and performance in manufacturing and service based systems. Also, it is recommended that product and 
service-based sectors adopt the Six Sigma technique for optimal outcome in organizations with the excellent process 
and quality product using modern manufacturing technologies of Industry 4.0. 
Keywords: Quality management, Lean Six Sigma, product sector, service-based sector, Industry 4.0. 
1. Introduction  
The Six Sigma philosophy was first introduced in the early 1980s as a scientific methodology in the third industrial 
revolution by Motorola, a study was carried out on Deming’s research on quality control centred on process variation 
by one of the strategic managers of the company. The whole idea behind the philosophy of the six-sigma implemented 
by Motorola was to reduce costs of products in a system at the same time improve system performance and product 
quality. According to Kumi and Morrow (2006), the six-sigma method was modified to a more interesting philosophy 
focused on the “Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control (DMAIC)” method, by an organization called General 
Electric, and also “Define, Measure, Analyse, Design, Verify (DMADV) or Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)”,  since the 
introduction, the methods have become very popular and applied in different systems globally, a good number of 
researchers have also focused on a hybrid system of lean and six-sigma. Six Sigma is of great benefit to manufacturing 
systems (product and service-based), especially in terms of quality improvement in systems, increasing the satisfaction 
of customers and reducing or eradicating defects in products (Kanigolla et al. 2013; Kwak and Anbari 2006). 
According to Parast (2011), six sigma has a huge transformation in terms of solution power when compared with other 
process improvement philosophies, the major difference is that Six Sigma offers system framework which is able to 
explore and facilitate solution procedure to problems all over the organisation. Day by day the philosophy continues 
to get popular in academics and industries. As scholars keep experimenting and observing how best to improve on

Abstract 
Processes in manufacturing and service organizations are regularly improved upon for better operational 
performance. Six Sigma is one of the management philosophies required to achieve improved quality and process 
performance in systems. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the existing literature that focused on Six 
Sigma philosophies in process industries and exposition on the future of Six Sigma approach in manufacturing. For 
the first time, this research focused on the recommendation of the fourth industrial revolution for process 
improvement and offer foreseeable decisions in every phase of the Six Sigma technique. Other aspects covered in 
this review include Six Sigma developments, metrics and capabilities, Six Sigma and quality management 
approaches; Six Sigma integration and innovation; Six Sigma and organizational sustenance and benefits of Six 
Sigma philosophies; confrontational concerns on Six Sigma Improvement Strategies and the future of Six Sigma. 
Future research directions focused on the Six Sigma philosophy and innovative technologies to support philosophy 
have been highlighted with effective recommendations.

1. Introduction 
Six Sigma is one of the most useful management philosophies that is capable of reducing defects while improving 
the efficiency of processes in systems (Kwak and Anbari 2006). It is a business strategy that seeks to identify and 
eliminate causes of defects or failures in processes by focusing on factors critical to the customer (Snee 2010).  This 
management philosophy has gradually stretched effectively to other sectors, product and service-based (Chakrabarty 
and Chuan 2007). In recent times, the management philosophy is noticed to gain more improvement from state-of-
the-art digital technologies thereby maintaining the quality of the product in industries.  Six Sigma tread the path of 
the rigorous project approach and extensive use of analytic and quality tools. Its structured team approach to solving 
problems has introduced in its formation a platform that breeds and diffuses knowledge.  
However, the research on Six Sigma philosophy irrespective of its impressive track records in practices is still at the 
low level (Zhang et al. 2009). This is because of divergent views and set perceptions on the Six Sigma subject. The 
concern of Six Sigma being perceived as a management fad, according to Zhang et al. (2009), has prevented many 
scholars from conducting rigorous research on Six Sigma. The research territory to date on Six Sigma subject has 
been found only within the North American region with only a few studies in Europe and Asia (Wang et al. 2004). 
Therefore, this paper seeks to systematically review Six Sigma and its methodologies, explore integration 
possibilities of Six sigma with other techniques, and discuss future possibilities of six sigma.

Abstract 
This research is focused on the application of Six Sigma-DMAIC (SS-DMAIC) technique to monitor the 
changing distribution of process capabilities in a cable manufacturing company for better operational 
performance. Most cable manufacturing organizations (CMOs) focus on classical methods and often pay less 
attention to inventive techniques for system improvement. Hence, the method adopted in this research is focused 
on comparing the initial and final process capability of executed projects, using the initial and final Sigma level 
and comparing initial and final economic impact assessment of the implemented project. The root causes of 
variation in cable manufacturing were identified as designs, parameter settings, materials, operation techniques, 
and measurement system errors. Improvement in materials and operations of a cable manufacturing company 
was attained by implementing SS-DMAIC technique in terms of the increased Sigma level. The organizational 
measurement system was assessed as well as the baseline performance of the system. In conclusion, the 
integration of SS-DMAIC with other business management initiatives in a dynamic cable manufacturing 
environment eliminated non-value-added activities from the process and the expected productivity rate for the 
extrusion start-up operation was achieved.

1. Introduction 
The Speedy growth in economic activities across the globe in recent time has resulted in progressively close 
competition in product and service-based systems. At present, organizations are determined and continuously 
striving to meet up customers’ expectations by focusing on product quality at every level. The spontaneity of 
markets evolutions and processes has propelled the product and service-based organizations around the world 
into developing new concepts of business management strategies to sustain their operational efficiency. Many 
companies have witnessed a paradigm shift from classical techniques to high-level methodologies/initiatives 
designed to help organizations tackle process improvement problems towards the rapid dynamic business 
challenges. Each of these business improvement initiatives is aimed to help business processes identify process 
issues, fix them and analyze the success or failure of those changes. Quality plays an important role in the 
success and failure of an organization.

6. Conclusion 
This research explored the innate potentials within Six Sigma approach, to monitor the changing distribution of 
process capabilities in a cable manufacturing organization. The SS-DMAIC approach has been validated in a 
cable manufacturing company in order to enhance organizational performance. The improvements of project 
performance and application impacts of the methodology have been investigated by comparing the initial and 
final capability of the process of the executed projects, by comparing the initial and final Sigma level of the 
executed projects, by comparing initial and final economic impact assessment of the executed project. The root 
causes of variation in cable manufacturing were identified, mainly as designs, parameter settings, materials, 
operation techniques, and measurement system errors. A tremendous improvement was achieved at the end of 
the projects in terms of the increased Sigma level. The organizational measurement system was assessed as well 
as the baseline performance of the system with the solution. Non-value-added activities were eliminated from 
the process and a Standard Time (ST), which is a common denominator for measuring productivity, was derived 
and implied in the study to ascertain the expected productivity rate for the extrusion start-up operation.

Abstract  
 
The global production of textile fibers, the consumption of textiles, and the amount of textile waste are generating 
problems at ever-higher levels. A way to reverse this situation is the reinsertion of clothing items already used in the 
production chain. Thus, in the light of the circular economy, this research aims to identify and characterize practices 
for the management of post-consumer textile waste involving the process of collection, sorting, and reinsertion of 
garment items in the production chain. The methodology applied to this study involved an in-depth semi-structured 
interview with 11 industry experts from micro and small-sized companies (SMEs) located in the Florianopolis city 
(Brazil). Our intention was to analyze their current textile waste management, considering the resources and the 
responsibilities necessary to carry out the circular textile waste management practices. It was concluded that 
although the business models may have emerged with sustainable principles in their foundation, waste management 
textiles are also strongly affected by the external environment, mainly by consumers.

1. Introduction 
 
The waste management literature has, accordingly, attached particular importance to disposal of clothing 
items in post-consumption due to the growth in the disposal of large quantities of textile waste to landfills and 
unsold stock through incineration (Hu et al., 2014, Hvass, 2014, Burton, 2018). In addition, although much of the 
textiles used in the manufactured items can be reused or recycled, it is estimated that 85% of global production has 
its final destination in landfills (Mckinsey Global Fashion Index, 2019; Burton, 2018).  
This issue can be changed if the flow of garment materials throughout the production chain and 
consumption becomes circular using reuse and recycling practices (Pal, Gander, 2018). In addition to environmental 
advantages that can be caused by the reuse and recycling of textiles, there are benefits from a socioeconomic

Abstract  
 
The acceleration of technology has changed the conventional banking service model to be electronic/digital based in 
the form of internet banking and mobile banking. The use of mobile banking applications in Indonesia experiences 
rapid growth. Throughout 2018, Bank Negara Indonesia recorded a significant transaction growth of 200%, Bank 
Central Asia at 66%, Bank Tabungan Indonesia 45%, and Bank CIMB Niaga 45%. This growth can not be separated 
from the development of smartphone technology, the Industrial Revolution 4.0 based on the Internet of Things 
(IoT), the need for easy and flexible banking services, as well as the vision and mission of digitization launched by 
the Financial Services Authority (OJK). This makes mobile banking as one of the banking resources in building                 
a competitive advantage in its business. 
Service quality is an important key in maintaining customer loyalty. Therefore, measuring the quality of mobile 
banking services is the first step to create a competitive advantage for banks. Through a literature study conducted in 
this study, a list of dimensions and indicators that can be used to measure the quality of mobile banking services will 
be generated, including: application aspect, complaint handling aspect, and economic benefit aspect.

1. Introduction 
 
Technological developments have changed the conventional banking service model to electronic/digital 
based in the form of internet banking and mobile banking. Electronic based banking services is known as e-banking. 
This change in service model provides various facilities for customers, including customers can access services from 
various locations so they do not have to visit bank branch offices (Driga and Isac 2014; Poon 2007). Other 
advantages are personal services, transaction security, transaction processing speed, and better service quality than 
conventional banking (Emad and Asem 2020). On the other hand, banks can increase competitiveness and expand 
market potential, which in turn can increase banking efficiency and productivity in the financial industry (Wirdiyanti 
2018). 
Banking services through electronic media (e-banking) include the banking transactions via ATM, Phone 
Banking, Electronic Fund Transfer, Internet Banking, and Mobile Phone (Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI) Number: 
9/15/PBI/2007). Digital banking services which are also defined as electronic banking services developed by 
optimizing the use of customer data in order to serve customers quicker and easier (customer experience), and can 
be operated independently by customers, with due regard to aspects of security (Financial Services Authority 
Regulation (POJK) Number 12/POJK.03/2018). Electronic/digital banking services are one of the keys for 
maintaining company excellence. Good electronic/digital servicesis an alternative to maintain good relationships 
with customers (Archan et al. 2015). This shows that electronic/digital services play an important role in 
maintaining the company's business sustainability. 
Mobile banking is one of the solutions applied by banks to increase competitiveness in order to meet 
customer needs, as a new distribution channel, improve business image, and reduce costs (Aladwani 2001). The 
important role of mobile banking in meeting customer needs can be seen from the data on the number of large bank 
transactions in Indonesia such as Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Tabungan Negara 
(BTN), and Bank CIMB Niaga. Throughout 2018 Bank Negara Indonesia recorded mobile banking transaction

(Archan et al. 2015). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on a literature study that has been conducted, the quality of mobile banking services was measured 
using 3 aspects, 14 dimensions and 41 indicators. The three aspects were application aspect, complaint handling 
aspect, and economical benefit aspect. The dimensions used to measure the quality of mobile banking services are: 
security, service features, content, process accuracy, ease of use, efficiency, aesthetics, continuous improvement, 
competence, courtesy/communication, understanding the customer, accessibility, responsiveness, and discount 
/compensation. 
 This research can be continue by conducting a process of validity and reliability using dimensions and 
indicators that have been formulated through literature studies and then measuring using a survey of respondents 
using dimensions and indicators that have been tested for validity and reliability.

Abstract 
Currently Project Based learning (PBL) is widely applied in higher education institutions. However, little is known 
about its critical influence as per postgraduate students’ engagement, employability, tasks building and responses 
within the courses. This paper presents a case study which is built based on a qualitative mechanism to explore these 
focused issues gained by respondents in Master of Engineering Management course at Queensland university of 
Technology (QUT).To accomplish this, a questionnaire was prepared and designed comprising of two sections; the 
first part is about the demographical information of the respondents, while the second part includes five relevant 
questions about improvement of the master course and Enterprise resource planning unit administrated to 113 
respondents. The qualitative analysis show that the dominant skills are management skills, communication skills, 
Software knowledge and related subject knowledge. Respondents show that the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
unit is organized well, lectures and tutorials are useful. Additionally, the BN87 course has an integrated comprehensive 
structure with all units implied. This paper may help lecturers and decision makers in their potential to redesign the 
relevant courses considering the views of the respondents and aligned with QUT long learning vision. 
  
Keywords: Employability, skills, questionnaire, Project based learning, ERP 
 
 
1. Introduction  
This paper presents the results of a questionnaire carried out to evaluate engineering postgraduate students' viewpoints 
regarding enterprise resource planning and project-based learning. Their perspective on the unit and the master 
program in addition to the potential acquired skills and competences also implied. Nowadays, numerous studies and 
methods are presented in order to be apply in engineering education, such as practicing project-based-learning and 
learning-by-doing, to achieve success in engineering courses and assimilate the engineer applicants into real life (Can, 
and Tora 2012), 
The relevant skills found to be further enhanced are written/oral communication and teamwork skills. This 
is generally requested as it is important to communicate together, supposed to have significant effect and to build the 
theme of team work and encourage its adoption amongst students and learners. Enterprise resource planning unit is 
administrated by many engineering schools and faculties. This system comprises different applications and 
components which address that its implementation is not still easy and it requires an attention and follow up. This is 
the case similar to the engineering economy course which is delivered by many universities (Kapusuz and Can, 2014). 
Lehmann et al. (2008) introduced both problem and project-based learning as an innovative learning strategy for 
sustainable development in the engineering education. Jewpanich & Piriyasurawong (2015) conducted a research aims 
to develop the project-based learning using discussion and lesson-learned methods via social media model (PBL-DLL 
SoMe Model) which is used for enhancing problem solving skills of undergraduate in education student. Woods (2013) 
described the learning environment while practicing the technologies of process oriented guided inquiry learning, 
model-eliciting activities, project-based synthesis. Karim(2010b) argued that the skills requested shall be focused and 
integrated with the industry needs and requirements. Chandrasekaran et al. (2012) explained that the benefits of

5. Discussion, conclusion and implications  
This paper is a case study about project-based learning implementation in a specialized enterprise resource planning 
unit (ENN570) conducted with the postgraduate students of master of engineering management (BN87) course. It 
contributes to the project-based leaning area as it reflected in the postgraduate students’ enrollment and participation 
in the unit project concerned with ENN570 ERP. Here, this study explores the followings (1) what are the relevant 
skills for engineering students that can be enhanced to further pursue the career path? (2) What are the 
improvements/suggestions can be done on BN87 and the relevant positive experiences. To answer these questions, 
authors developed the questionnaire including two sections. It is recognized that redevelopment of the course can 
foster and enhance teaching and learning as it adopts the interactive and deep learning by students which can affect 
their academic achievements and performance. The qualitative analysis based on the introduced themes show that the 
master course is well prepared and organized in better manner, however, still some suggestion and recommendations 
are raised by the respondents towards improving the unit and the course at all. Focusing on the real learning is among 
the priorities in QUT. This encourages staff members and students together to be engaged in the learning and teaching 
process and focusing on the new techniques for curriculum redesign that matches with the international standards and 
intended learning outcomes. The implications of this paper come as a result of introducing the research project to the 
students and trying to upgrade their practical skills and knowledge in relevant field. These projects are based on real 
life problems and adopting the technologies to find an appropriate technique for solving the potential problems. A real 
implication here is considering this case study conducted in the developed nation of Australia and within one of the 
top ranked university, QUT. The designed questionnaire has a clear impact as it is directed to postgraduate engineering 
students from different countries and this could be treated as one of the advantages for this study. This means that 
views, criticism and suggestions for improvement are treated from several key persons specialized in the different 
engineering sciences and practices.  
 
5.1 Limitations and future research  
Similar to other studies in the field, this paper has limitations such that this study is qualitative designed. Further, it is 
conducted focusing on only one university and one unit and course designed. Other researchers can utilize the 
developed questionnaire and adopt to other units/courses so that improvement and redevelopment can be established. 
Future research can be established while doing empirical investigation on the assessment processes aligned for the 
unit introduced.

Abstract 
 
The swiftly metamorphosing networks of the Philippine transportation system greatly encourage movement all around 
the country. The capacity of the country’s major roads in comparison with the opportunities and exigencies that 
demand the people to travel is frequently misaligned— metropolises are now enabled to cater more road networks and 
the main road segments have become more congested. This impacts neighboring developing cities like Meycauayan. 
This study aimed to conceive a CTSA (Comprehensive Traffic State Assessment) model by using the road segment 
of Iba-Malhacan as a case study. The study employed confirmatory factor analysis for the testing of hypotheses and 
verification of the model’s integrity involving a sample size of 204 Meycauayan residents; all the established 
hypotheses were sufficiently proven and the model also indicated an overall good fit. The study also employed a 
simplified road and traffic analysis for the delineation of the road segment’s general traffic state.  The study determined 
that the gradual worsening of the traffic state was mainly because of the immense aggregate average daily volumes of 
standard passenger cars, four-wheeled PUVs (public utility vehicles), as well as large trucks and other heavy vehicles 
both capital-bound and homeward— a CTSA-based objectives tree was engendered as a recommendation.

Introduction 
 
It is quite fair to state that the capacity of the country’s major roads in comparison with the opportunities and exigencies 
that demand the people to travel are frequently misaligned— the impacts of the rapid industrialization, urbanization, 
and the infrastructure boom crawl with haste to neighboring cities within the close vicinity of Mega Manila, and a 
particular one is the City of Meycauayan. Meycauayan is a rapidly developing city which acts as a gateway for the 
National Capital Region into the rural parts of Central Luzon. In recent years, Meycauayan has been highly 
industrialized due to it being once abundant in land and vicinity to the nation’s capital—  industrial parks were 
gradually erected in the city; a consequence of that is the emergence of small to heavy industry trucks and their 
subsequent contribution to the traffic composition. Currently, Meycauayan suffers from daily traffic congestion 
covering most of the main roads; the jams would put the cars into a standstill especially at peak hours. The road 
segments that frequently suffer from this plight are the ones that are connected to major intersections of the city, a 
particular road segment that bears the greatest brunt is the span of Iba-Malhacan— which covers the great majority of 
travels both in the secondary and tertiary roads. In relation to all these, constructing a model for transport planning 
and traffic management that shall take into consideration the expeditious growth of locales, together with the rate of 
urbanization and industrialization, as well as taking into account the various elements that bring about significant 
impacts is highly imperative as also once emphasized by Lidasan, Espada, & De Leon (2010).  
The overture of this case study encompassed the necessity of formulating a comprehensive model for the integrated 
LGU (local government unit) transportation planning and traffic management model, as well as the supposed benefits 
of conducting research pertaining to the said subject. The main component of the research was the formulation of the 
comprehensive LGU transportation planning and traffic management model by utilizing the road segment of Iba-

1140",,"acknowledges an extensive array of variables in order to aid not only fellow researchers with kindred spirits but also 
public servants wearing their hearts on their sleeves. All in all, the outcomes of this case study of the Iba-Malhacan 
road segment of the City of Meycauayan contribute significantly not only to the furtherance of the CTSA model to its 
possible actualization— but also to the discipline of transportation planning and traffic management in the Philippine 
context.

Abstract 
This article presents innovative practices for remote teaching with the use of Information and 
Communication Technologies - ICTs, based on reports of experiences of teachers and students 
of technological high school in virtual laboratory classes on Arduino. What are the teaching 
strategies to transmit practical aspects of Arduino, in this teaching modality. The research was 
carried out with students and teachers participating in the discipline of Physics with the 
application of Arduino, with students of 2nd and 3rd years of technological high school. We 
present the approaches and strategies used by the teacher, in this teaching modality in the 
Federal Institutions of Technological High School, State Technical School - Etec and Senais. 
It was possible to highlight that the element of teaching practice in the remote modality, as a 
new paradigm in the teaching process in new learning environments. As for the student's 
perception of learning, 82% of teachers considered it productive and 18% insufficient in the 
practical part due to the lack of training and availability of virtual laboratories, for this type of 
teaching and learning. As an improvement of this teaching process, the following data were 
indicated by the teachers: 18% infrastructure for the student, 36% activating teacher training

possible to reduce the time that the student was without class, as well as the continuity of his 
studies, in order to avoid the prejudice with the paralysis of teaching in Brazil.

Abstract 
 
Typical manufacturing companies have been adding services to products to create new offers to strengthen the 
relationship with clients. This is a process named ‘servitization’. In this context, the present study aims at 
investigating the literature on servitization in typical manufacturing companies in recent years. Articles published in 
the past 10 years, retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases resulted in 50 
publications for further analysis. A bibliometric analysis identified that the articles were authored by 145 authors 
and co-authors from 14 countries, published in 27 journals, and present a set of 414 keywords. A preliminary 
content analysis shows that the transition to servitization needs attention as the challenges and barriers for 
organizations to overcome. The literature also points out a growth of digital servitization, which is a subject for 
further exploration, since the use of technology for the development of new solutions may strengthen service 
offerings.

1. Introduction 
Companies often find themselves situated within highly competitive environments (Markides 2015), and are 
constantly challenged to rethink how they offer services (Rymaszewska et al. 2017). Service providers typically 
offer one or more services that are projected to meet the needs of a group of targeted clients (Kowalkowski et al. 
2017). Many companies in the manufacturing sector offer services in conjunction with product portfolios, because 
this union provides a more holistic experience to the consumers (Gurtu 2019). Over the last few years products have 
become less profitable (Marilungo et al. 2017). This has led to an increased discussion on how to integrate products 
and services (Gurtu, 2019). One profitable opportunity may be to invest in offering services within this scenario 
(Baines et al. 2017). Companies that traditionally offer products have expanded quickly to offer services to clients, 
especially in developing countries (Baines et al. 2017; Valtakoski, 2017). 
 
Providing services allows companies to increase their profit margins, aggregate value to the products and goods they 
manufacture, and allow companies to differentiate them from their competitors, without needing to reduce 
operational costs to remain competitive (Baines et al. 2017). This movement towards offering services and solutions 
in conjunction with products is called ‘servitization’ (Vandermerwe and Rada 1988). Baines et al. (2017) define 
‘servitization’ as an innovation of capabilities, and organizational processes that move away from a model based on 
negotiating “the sale of products” towards “the sale of products and services together that aggregates value in an 
integrated way”. A business model translates strategies, like position and strategic objectives, explicitly stating how 
the business is planned and operated (Osterwalder et al. 2005). 
 
1.1 Objectives 
There are many challenges surrounding transitions to servitization that traditional manufacturing companies face. In 
this sense, this study seeks to investigate the topic of servitization through a literature review by using bibliometric 
analysis and content analysis. This paper is then divided into four sections, in addition to the introduction. Section 2 
addresses the theoretical basis for the study, seeking to provide a conceptual base for the themes addressed here.

1153",,"topic for future research, given advances in technology that can create new opportunities for developing new 
solutions directed towards ensuring that transition processes are successful. Finally, this study may serve as a base 
for other studies that seek to expand upon the topic of transitions towards servitization for traditional manufacturing 
companies. Next phase is to perform a contents analysis in order to achieve more robust literature outcomes.

Abstract  
 
The world's consumption of milk has been growing since the '80s. The Food and Agriculture Organization of United 
Nations (FAO) Predicts a growth rate of milk production of 2.5% per year for 2020-2030. Furthermore, it estimates 
that per capita consumption in developing countries (such as Colombia) will increase at twice the rate of production 
in this period. In the dairy sector of Atlántico (a Northern State of Colombia), inefficiency in the logistics process in 
milk collection was identified due to the lack of efficient operating models and the atomization of producers (long 
distances), among other causes. Moreover, in Colombia, the milk collection costs represent 33% of the logistics costs, 
being above the average in the dairy sector worldwide, that reduces productivity and competitiveness to the sector. 
The milk collection process, at strategic-tactical level can be tackled as a districting problem with a two-phase 
approach ""group first - route later"" as an alternative to the classic vehicle routing problem. This has motivated the 
current work to solve the milk collection at strategic-tactical level in Atlántico, through a districting design strategy 
to minimize the distances to be covered in a subsequent routing while consolidating the farms into districts and 
optimizing the composition of the fleet. A districting strategy prior to the routing process improves efficiency in 
collection and distribution processes.  
 
In the present work, we propose a multi-objective optimization model with the location-allocation approach, in which 
once the collection centers are located, the allocation of farms to them is balanced, within a logistic districting context. 
We combine the milk collection and districting context, to address two objectives that impact the efficiency of the 
milk collection process, namely: (i) minimize the dispersion measured as the sum of the distances to travel between 
farms and their assigned collection center, (ii) minimize the cost of the facilities and the vehicle fleet. In addition, we 
consider some districting and milk collection criteria, constraints, and characteristics to get compact districts 
considering a limit of distance between the farms and their collection center (center of the district), get balanced 
districts in relation to the daily milk supply considering capacity constraints of collection centers and vehicles fleet, 
no load division and heterogeneous fleet. We expect an improvement in terms of costs due to shorter travel distances 
and better use of the fleet.

Abstract  
 
In Colombia, the annual production of milk was 7,301 million liters in 2019. The dairy sector accounts for 1.6 percent 
of national GDP (gross domestic product) and 21.8 percent of agricultural GDP. However, the results for this sector 
have not been satisfactory as expected in the last decades as compared to the rest of Latin America. As we were able 
to identify, many problems have been reported in the primary productive sector such as: lack of policies to improve 
productivity, inefficiency in production, inadequate technical production processes, huge variability in production 
prices, competitive disadvantages generated by the massive inflow of imported goods, among others, which 
contributes greatly to the reductions on dairy farms profitability. The latter implies the need for research on decision-
making tools that reduce uncertainty in the dairy industry. The use of technical indexes aimed to control in evaluate 
dairy farms in terms of productivity and profitability, which can be useful to monitor and track changes and 
requirements for the Colombian dairy industry. In Colombia, there are no studies addressed at the determinants of 
profitability of the dairy sector. This has motivated the current work to study profitability using predictive analytics, 
through an integrated approach considering costs, productivity, economic and technical indexes. This project proposes 
a management model that supports decision-making on dairy farms by calculating profitability and generating alerts 
based on the sensibility of selected input variables. The model focuses on the determination of the cause-effect 
relationships between the input and output variables (net annual income, profit margin, and return rates on the invested 
capital) to explain the determinant of profitability in the farm. First, we described the generalities of the primary link 
in the dairy sector in Colombia. Second, using a panel of experts we selected a set of variables related to feed, animals, 
human resources, fertilization, among others. We used principal component analysis (PCA) as a tool to reduce 
preselected inputs to those that explain better the variance and have the greatest impact on output variables. The results 
of this PCA worked as an initial model for multiple linear regression models as the primary methodology for 
establishing cause-effect relationships between input and output variables (a model for each output variable) that can 
explain the profitability of the production in the farm. We used R Studio to operate both methodologies. Our final goal 
is to calculate the profitability considering our output variables. Furthermore, generate alerts on input variables based 
on scenario analysis to support decision-making in dairy farms. Our work team had access to an experimental farm of 
the Center of Agricultural Practices and Development of the Universidad de Antioquia located in the municipality of 
San Pedro de los Milagros, Antioquia, where we used productive records of this farm, developing indexes and 
generating new determinants of profitability if these were not available. We propose to validate this model on farms 
in other regions in Colombia in order to verify the capacity to calculate profitability in real management situations in 
the Colombian dairy productive sector.

Abstract 
 
Circular Economy (CE) is a fundamental instrument for public institutions, organizations, the population, among 
others, to take safe steps towards sustainability. Integrated Management Systems (IMS) is defined as a set of 
interconnected processes that share information regarding human, financial, material and infrastructure resources, 
among others, in order to successfully achieve organizational goals that satisfy their stakeholders. The objective 
of this article is to cross analyze the main topics between the CE and IMS and develop a discussion that allows 
exploring the synergies between both. The methods chosen were bibliographic review and content analysis. Most 
of the analyses between the clusters of the CE and IMS present a significant synergy. The contribution applied 
was the availability of strategies that can be incorporated into the management of organizations with socio-
environmental and profitability goals or that seek to improve their relationships with their stakeholders.

1. Introduction  
Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, new manufacturing methods have allowed large-scale 
production, enabling the great availability of products at low cost (Lieder and Rashid 2016). With this productivity 
growth, there have been impacts such as loss of biodiversity, water, soil, and air pollution; depletion of resources, 
and the possibility of compromising the systems that support life on the planet (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017). Based 
on this scenario, international organizations such as the United Nations sought to promote models that take into 
account environmental limitations and that prioritize the use of renewable energy (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 
2017). This change in mentality can help solve an ""equation"" that presents population growth and the need for 
economic development as variables, while at the same time having in this formula the limitation of resources 
(Lieder and Rashid 2016). The Circular Economy (CE) emerged as an alternative to transform both the elements 
for maintaining nature and meeting the material needs of the population into a common denominator, with a 
proposition to reconcile these two aspects and not leave them in a dichotomous condition or even competitors 
(Ghisellini, Cialani, and Ulgiati 2016). With the insertion of the CE in the economic activities, the productive 
systems are built and rebuilt, integrating the totality of this same system. Like cotton or wood, which when no 
longer used can be destined to processes like composting and aerobic digestion, regenerating living systems that 
will return to economic activity as renewable resources (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017). The CE is a 
fundamental tool for public institutions, organizations, population, among others, to take safe steps towards 
sustainability (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017). Sustainability is a principle supported by the environment, society, and 
the economy, which values the balance of these three pillars with a view to sustainable development (Elkington 
1997). Although there are many studies on the subject, with over a thousand articles cataloged in Scopus' database, 
the CE presents itself in the eyes of the business community and public management as an incipient and 
disorganized concept, which needs to be better improved to be implemented and contribute to the emerging 
demands (Korhonen, Honkasalo, and Seppälä 2018). 
Starting from the integrating vocation of the Circular Economy and the current applied and conceptual 
misunderstanding of the CE, research gaps were identified that indicate a possibility that the Integrated 
Management System (IMS) could complement and improve the CE about the modus operandi in the corporate 
scenario, directing organizations to reconcile economic competitiveness without running into environmental 
depredation (Lieder and Rashid 2016; Witjes and Lozano 2016). IMS not only can contribute to the improvement

Abstract 
 
This paper presents the integration of a wireless long-range sensor network (LoRa), using the LoRaWAN protocol, to 
an OPC TCP network with OPC UA standard. This proposal allows the creation of cyber-physical spaces where all 
the elements can communicate in a safe, adaptable, and scalable way offering an IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) 
solution - useful for Industry 4.0. Due to the specificities of each protocol (LoRa, LoRaWAN and OPC UA), 
developments in hardware, firmware, and software are presented for the purpose to obtain an integrated solution 
capable of providing data from a LoRaWAN network directly to an HMI, using the OPC UA standard. The work also 
presents details of the embedded electronic system, developed for the LoRa sensor nodes, including the specification 
of the components used and signal conditioning circuits required. Furthermore, this work also presents the 
implementation stages of the LoRaWAN - OPC UA Gateway, based on the open-source operational system, OpenWrt, 
one of the main components necessary for the proposed integration working. Suggestions for programming the OPC 
UA server, embedded in the OpenWrt OS, are detailed. Tests of the developed LoRa sensor nodes, as well as the 
integration with a SCADA operator interface are presented, demonstrating that the proposal integration is feasible and 
can be applied to increase I/O points monitored by an operator, without the need for intervention in the installed 
automation system.

IoT, OPC UA, LoRaWAN, OpenWrt and Industry 4.0. 
 
1. Introduction 
The use of technologies that aim at the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) is a vast field to be explored, bringing 
viability to Industry 4.0. The concept of IoT was originally employed by Kevin Ashton in 1999, when he proposed 
the idea of different objects feeling the world around them through networks (Rangel 2014). At the present time, the 
IoT can be better interpreted as digital interconnections between objects, assets and systems that were previously 
isolated, but that are now able to connect and exchange information with each other. In the industrial context, a new 
term derived from IoT emerges: the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which takes into account the specific needs 
of the industrial environment in the use of solutions based on the concept of IoT, such as security, availability, non-
intrusive data collection in the industrial process and compatibility of communication protocols. 
 
There are several protocols and communication technologies based on the Internet of Things, including the 
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol and the LoRa (Long Range) radio transmission technology. 
LoRa technology has gained prominence among developers for bringing together in a single, small and inexpensive 
hardware, interesting features for sensor networks applied to IoT and IIoT, such as long range, low power consumption 
and high noise immunity (Compology 2017), (Purche 2016). The LoRaWAN protocol is maintained by the LoRa 
Alliance and defines in its network structure an architecture in star topology protected by 128-bit encryption, allowing 
the communication of end devices with a network central concentrator point, the gateway (LoRa Alliance 2015).

1177","In the LoRaWAN network, packets can be lost due to collisions, this possibility is less likely to occur, since one 
or more packets must be on the same frequency (Coding Rate and Band Width) at the same time. Losses are more 
likely to occur due to failures in the execution of the LoRaWAN and OPC UA integration software, embedded in the 
gateway. A problem that is still under investigation. 
 
 
Figure 8. (a) Hardware and SCADA interface test bench. 
6. Conclusion 
This work sought to address all the necessary steps to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the LoRaWAN and 
OPC UA protocols embedded in a network device to then be used as another communication option for industrial 
environments, within the context of Industry 4.0 and IIoT technologies. 
 
The results obtained in the tests of the LoRaWAN network demonstrate the promising characteristics of the 
protocol in terms of range, cost and ease of implementation. The results obtained in the range test show that the 
technology can be used in large industrial parks where the diversified structure of tanks, pipes and concrete buildings 
do not represent major impediments to signal collection. By using appropriate antennas, in addition to ensuring the 
correct location of the gateway nodes and sensors, it is possible to eliminate several obstacles to the signal, thus 
contributing to the creation of a cyber-physical space. 
 
With regard to OPC UA, the present work demonstrated one of its main characteristics, i.e. the independence of 
platforms, through the compilation and execution of an OPC UA server embedded on the same hardware of the 
LoRAWAN gateway, contributing to the reduction of costs in infrastructure. Software licensing is free due to the 
choice of Open62541 open source libraries and the OpenWRT system, also open source and present in several network 
infrastructure devices, constantly being developed by the developer community. 
 
The LoRaWAN and OPC UA protocols worked properly and efficiently, implemented separately. The integration 
between both also took place successfully and, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the integration, temperature 
measurements were carried out, which is a quantity common to the industrial environment, focusing on the 
representation of these data in a SCADA interface that includes the software for supervision and operation in use for 
decades across the industry. Presenting this data at the SCADA level reliably validates the proposed integration.

Abstract 
 
Scheduling radiotherapy treatments for cancer patients is a major concern for hospitals and patients. The delay in 
radiotherapy has a negative effect on the patient and flow of patients in hospitals. This research proposes a 
mathematical model for multi-period radiotherapy planning and scheduling problems with capacity constraints over a 
particular time horizon. The goal is to schedule a list of 3D curative patients who must undergo radiotherapy. The 
problem is formulated with a multi-objective model with two objectives and two stages: minimize the makespan and 
priority score in the first stage and minimize and the sum of the finish time and the sum of different balance workloads 
in the second stage. Computational experiments are executed using the simulated data according to real treatments of 
3D curative patients. The results show that the model satisfies all constraints with the right assignment and operation 
sequence. Thus, the proposed mathematical model can assist in the decision-making process for cancer patient 
scheduling for radiotherapy treatment. This helps reduce the time for planning and scheduling in the radiotherapy 
department.

The multi-period radiotherapy planning and scheduling problem with capacity constraint over a particular time 
horizon. increase scheduling performance such as patient waiting time, scheduling time during the procedures. The 
problem is formulated with a multi-objective model with two objectives, and two stages are considered in the proposed 
model: minimization of makespan and priority score in first and minimize the sum of the finish time and sum of 
difference balance workload. Then, an instance inspired by the real process of 3D curative patients planning. The 
results show that the model satisfies all constraints with the right assignment and operation sequence. The proposed 
mathematical model is able to assist in the decision-making process for cancer patient scheduling for radiotherapy 
treatment. This helps reduce the time for planning and scheduling in the radiotherapy department. Thus, the average 
patient waiting time is decreased. 
Nevertheless, the radiotherapy planning and scheduling problem is usually discussed under the assumption that the 
parameter and capacity are deterministic variables. In practice, some of these assumptions are unrealistic. In the future, 
research should focus on a dynamic model for handling uncertainty in real-world practice.

Abstract 
 
Effective inventory management influences every aspect of a firm’s operations. Inventory management in developing 
countries is a difficult business process because firms do not use basic inventory control concepts and techniques. 
Moreover, developing countries are characterized by trade imbalances with developed countries due to process 
inefficiencies, bureaucracy, and communication problems. This leads to longer lead times and supply uncertainty. 
Consequently, firms attempt to overcome the supply uncertainty by carrying unnecessary amounts of buffer stocks. 
We analyzed the inventory management system of an international lifestyle product retailer in Bolivia and found that, 
as the literature predicted, the firm showed no use of basic inventory control techniques. Particularly, it did not make 
data-driven decisions, lacked an effective inventory management system, or knew which products had higher 
consumer demand, and thus worked under a high level of supply uncertainty and inventory management illiteracy. 
Therefore, to reduce supply uncertainty, we developed a new inventory management system based on two strategies: 
(a) strategies to reduce demand uncertainty; and (b) strategies to reduce process uncertainty. Specifically, we 
implemented triple exponential smoothing for product demand forecasting, ABC segmentation to identify the most 
important products in the firm’s portfolio, the newsvendor model to determine optimal inventory levels, powers-of-
two policies, to optimize reorder times, and Turnover Based Metrics to arrange SKUs in the warehouse. Overall, our 
results suggest the significance of taking into account the country in which any firm operates. Hence, it should not be 
a surprise that in developing countries firms show high buffer stocks and generally adopt reactive flexibility practices.

1198",,"C-type products. These differences are due to ABC analysis assumes the absence of demand volatility in the products 
under study (Hopp and Spearman 2011). Thus, the introduction of demand volatility in our analyses improves the 
reliability of our product categorization. Next, to estimate optimal order quantities we used the newsvendor model 
(Hopp and Spearman 2011) because the firm sells innovative low-cost products and needs high inventory turnover. 
Using the forecasted demand for each product group into the newsvendor model, we calculated the optimal order 
quantities for each product group and the optimal reorder times for three consumer demand scenarios (scenario 1, no 
change in demand; scenario 2, 13% demand reduction; scenario 3, 32% demand reduction). The results from Tables 
2, 3, and 4 show the existence of different optimal reorder times for each product group. These results were impractical 
because for each order the firm should only use a single container with multiple products. Moreover, it cannot place 
different orders with different lead times for different product groups. Hence, we used PO2 policies (Muckstadt and 
Sapra 2010) to combine orders from many products, in a cost-effective way, in a single container, and thus estimating 
practical reorder times (see Tables 2, 3, and 4). Consequently, the three scenarios suggest that A and B-type products 
should be reordered every 32 weeks.  However, C-type products, except stationery and gifts and toy series, should be 
reordered every 64 weeks. Subsequently, we developed strategies to reduce process uncertainty. Specifically, we 
aimed to reduce high processing times through warehouse slotting. Specifically, using the results presented above and 
Turnover Based Metrics (Kofler et al. 2014), within each product group the SKUs were arranged via a simple policy 
of highest product demand and its proximity to the warehouse entrance (see Figure 3). 
 
Our findings generally indicate the significance of taking account of the context in which any firm operates. 
Particularly, Bolivia is a developing country and historically has been characterized as a politically unstable country 
(Herbas-Torrico et al. 2021). Political instability causes constant material supply problems due to protest marches and 
road blockades (Arce and Rice 2009; Los Tiempos 2020). For example, the political crisis of 2019 caused 150 firms 
to declare bankruptcy and close down (Pagina Siete 2019). Therefore, as Goonatilake (1984) suggests, Bolivian firms 
should rely on abnormally high buffer stocks, do not use conventional inventory management practices, and thus have 
higher production costs. Our case study showed no different behavior to firms from other developing countries. These 
conditions suggest that firms from developing countries should aim to work on reactive flexibility practices. Moreover, 
firms should lobby their governments to improve business infrastructure and reduce excessive bureaucratic 
procedures.  In the first case, firms should aim to increase safety stocks, capacity buffers, supplier backups, and safety 
lead times. For the second case, firms should jointly work with local and federal governments to develop a better 
business infrastructure.  
 
Finally, our study shows that the implementation of reactive flexibility practices can greatly improve inventory 
practices. Yet, the limited sample size of our study limits the generalizability of our results. Thus, more studies are 
needed to confirm our findings. Moreover, the particular business characteristics of our case study limit the capacity 
to extend forecasting results to other products and industries. However, the framework of strategies used to reduce 
supply uncertainty can be used in other industries. Furthermore, our article suggests that inventory management 
practices from developed countries can also be used in developing countries to reduce supply uncertainty. However, 
as our study found, firms in developing countries do not even use basic inventory management practices. Hence, most 
management decisions still are subjective in nature, instead of data-driven. Therefore, the intelligent use of demand 
and inventory information in developing countries has considerable potential for a firm’s growth. This information 
should uncover patterns, unexpected relationships, and market trends, making it possible to reduce buffer stocks, 
accurately forecast demand, and reduce inventory processing time.

Abstract  
 
Consumer loyalty is a determinant of the company's progress. Meanwhile, the number of consumers who come needs 
to be balanced with full-service provision to increase consumer loyalty. In 2017-2019 Toyota servicing decreased 
quite drastically. The strategy to maintain loyal customers starts from fulfilling expectations and providing a good 
value perception to create consumer loyalty to the company. The research technique used in this research is descriptive 
verification. The sampling technique used is non-probability with the incidental sampling method; the number of 
samples used is 150 respondents who have used service services at Toyota, Bandung - Indonesia. The descriptive 
research results show that the respondents' responses to the variable expectations, perceived consumer value, and 
customer loyalty services in Toyota are included in the Good category. Perception of consumer value. The study's 
findings show that, through the dimensions used, the reliability, responsiveness, assurance, facilities, and employees 
influence consumer loyalty. Furthermore, it is found that there is an indirect influence between the perceived value of 
increasing the relationship between customer expectations and customer loyalty. Examining the problem's 
phenomenon, the researchers focused on studying the impact of customer expectation, perceived value, and customer 
loyalty.

1. Introduction 
Customer expectations are essential to enable their impact on loyalty (Martínez and Rodríguez del Bosque 2013). 
Consumer loyalty will be boosted when the actual service level is better than expected, whereas when the service level 
is lower than expected, the satisfaction will decrease (Saleem et al., 2014). Satisfaction is said to be someone's feeling 
of pleasure or disappointment resulting from comparing the perceived performance of a product or service concerning 
consumer expectations (Almsalam 2014; Hikmawati, Alamsyah, and Setiadi 2020). Generally, customer expectations 
are estimates or customer beliefs about what they will receive (Ratna 2011). Every customer must have expectations 
in making a purchase decision, be it a product or service; this expectation has an essential role as a standard of 
comparison in evaluating the quality of services provided. Companies can provide more perceived value than the 
quality of services or products provided to customers. The higher the consumers' positive perception, the higher the

1210","reach a value of 100%. Next is the research hypothesis test of the effect of perceived value on loyalty, where the test 
results can be seen in Table 2. In the table, it is clear that the tcount value of the research results for the relationship of 
customer perceived value is 2.003. while the t table for the number of respondents 150 is 1.65 (5% error rate) So it 
can be analyzed that tcount> ttable, which is 2.003> 1.65, this indicates that Ha is accepted and H0 is rejected. So it is 
emphasized that the influence of the perceived value of the customer on customer loyalty has a significant effect.  
 
4.5. Relationship of Customer Expectation to Variabel Perceived Value 
Based on the data from the statistical analysis in the Figure above, the correlation between the variable expectations 
and the perceived value variable has a relationship of 0.981, so that the increase in both has a positive impact. The 
magnitude of the correlation between expectations and the customer value perception variable is 96.2%, the percentage 
value is very good, therefore in an effort to increase loyalty, it takes the expectations desired by consumers and can 
provide a good view or perception of consumers and be able to provide a relationship. Positive with the loyalty variable 
to be able to reach a value of 100%. Next is the research hypothesis test of the effect of expectations on loyalty, where 
the test results can be seen in Table 2. It is clear that the tcount value of the research results for the relationship of the 
perceived value is 3.507. while the ttable for the number of respondents 150 is 1.65 (5% error rate) So it can be analyzed 
that tcount> ttable, namely 3.507> 1.65, this indicates that Ha is accepted and H0 is rejected. So it is emphasized that the 
influence of customer expectation on perceived value has a significant effect.  
 
6. Conclusions 
Based on the research and discussion results, the conclusion of this study is that customer expectations affect customer 
loyalty. The higher the level of expectations met by the service management, the higher the customer loyalty. Based 
on research conducted that Toyota services meet expectations, which can affect customer loyalty for the better. The 
perceived value affects customer loyalty in service consumers. This means that the perceived value received by 
consumers can increase consumer loyalty for the better. Customer Expectation on Perceived Value has a fairly large 
and significant value. The higher the consumer's expectations, the higher the consumer's perceived value. This study 
has limitations, which do not discuss the consumer's character, which has an impact on consumer loyalty behavior. So 
that it becomes a suggestion for further research to discuss the character of consumers.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to examine seasonal products through customer satisfaction so that the stages of product creation can 
be found following market desires. The research was conducted using the action research method, considering that 
the researcher is also an entrepreneur who runs a business with Doodle Noodle's name. The study was carried out by 
creating a business canvas model through the value proposition canvas, followed by the creation of product 
prototyping, and evaluating customer satisfaction through a quantitative questionnaire. The research results found that 
the value proposition canvas is a tool capable of supporting entrepreneurs before creating products. Where the value 
proposition canvas allows entrepreneurs to know the weaknesses and strengths of their resources, furthermore, it is 
known that the value proposition canvas provides important information for the creation of new products following 
market desires. So that the products created can be accepted by the market well. The results of distributing 
questionnaires show that the products created by Doodle Noodle can be well received by consumers, based on the 
value of customer satisfaction and consumer acceptance of Doodle Noodle products. This research is particularly 
beneficial for entrepreneurs who are starting or updating innovative products. It also provides new views on the 
importance of product prototyping to support the process of receiving products to target markets.

1. Introduction 
The food business in Bandung is one of the fastest-growing businesses and can support the regional economy (Utama 
and Ratnapuri 2018). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the increase in the culinary business in Bandung 
is motivated by the rapid progress in science and information technology, which has a positive influence on the tourism 
sector in the city of Bandung. The ease of accessing tourism destination data makes tourists interested in visiting and 
requires availability to support their trip, one of which is food and drinks (Hikmawati and Alamsyah 2018). The 
culinary business in Bandung is considered very promising given the growth in demand for culinary products reaching 
ten percent per year. This invites the presence of many new players in the culinary business (Utama and Ratnapuri 
2018). The growth in demand for culinary products in Bandung is influenced by several things, such as the breadth of 
the culinary product market that always makes people curious (Alamsyah et al. 2018; Limakrisna, Sudarso, and Daryus 
2015). Coupled with the geographical structure at an altitude with cold weather, culinary products are always the 
choice for consumers to choose (Nurani, Subekti, and Ana 2016). This opprtunities certainly provides new 
opportunities covering a company's efforts to innovate and introduce products or services. The demand is for a 
business to be one step ahead of its competitors (Alamsyah and Febriani 2020; Novari 2020). However, without 
research and product development, a business will find it difficult to compete with its competitors (Bello et al. 2016). 
Therefore, the role of research and development in new business is very decisive and needs to be done by culinary 
business people. Considering the number of business people who enter the culinary sector is quite high, it requires 
continuous innovation to continue to compete in the market.  
In Indonesia, noodle products are one of the public's staple foods, especially instant noodles (Herryani, Sinaga, and 
Brahmantyo 2016). Based on the National Socio-Economic Survey data in 2018, it is said that the national average 
consumption of instant noodles reaches 15 packs per month per household. WorldPanel Indonesia launched the 
ranking of brands in the fast-moving consumer goods industry through the Brand Footprint in 2015 (Herryani et al. 
2016). In this research, the Indomie brand was ranked first as the brand most frequently purchased by households, 
followed by Mie Sedaap in second place (Tian and Slocum 2016). These findings certainly explain the large market

initial capital before prototyping products are created. Based on the value proposition canvas created based on input 
from consumers and research results from research and development, followed by the creation of products that match 
the criteria. In this case, Noodle Noodles creates two products, namely Healthy Noodle and Healthy Mentai. Then the 
product is sent to consumers to be tested and assessed for customer satisfaction.  
 
4.2. Consumer Satisfaction of Products  
In the next stage of the research, questionnaires were distributed to new consumers; 20 consumers were targeted to 
evaluate the product's level of satisfaction. After distributing the questionnaires to respondents, the data from the 
questionnaires were tabulated, and a frequency was made to assess the result in the form of an average value. There 
are six measurement indicators with tabulated results attached to Table 1.

Based on the results in Table 1, six assessment survey results focus on assessing satisfaction with the prototyping 
product from Doodle Noodle. Assessed from the survey score that most consumers like the product, they are interested 
in buying the product, consuming the product, and attraction to the product. This is based on the average values 
obtained above 3.00, which explains the acceptance of the Doodle Noodle products created, namely Healthy Noodle 
and Healthy Mentai. Another interesting finding is the level of satisfaction with the product, where it is known that 
the average value is 4.03, which explains that all consumers are satisfied with the product they receive. Especially for 
revenue as a seasonal product, considering the average value is above 4, namely 4.68. These findings can affect the 
implementation of the creation of new products carried out by Doodle Noodle based on market desires and continued 
to be marketed. These findings explain the importance of the value proposition canvas and product validation to 
prepare new products or seasonal products following market desires.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study aims to examine the seasonal product prototyping created by Doodle Noodle. The study was conducted 
with the stages of creating a business model canvas and testing customer satisfaction. This research activity found that 
the value proposition canvas, which is part of the business model canvas, can be used by companies who want to 
change or create new products according to market desires. After there is a value proposition canvas, the company 
can create new products, and it needs to be tested, including using the consumer satisfaction index. The new products 
created by Doodle Noodle, namely Healthy Noodle and Healthy Mentai, are in fact acceptable to the market, based 
on the results of quantitative assessments. This research provides benefits for culinary entrepreneurs, especially in 
paying attention to the business canvas model's benefits and testing new products. However, this study has limitations, 
where the study of products on consumers is limited in scope and does not examine other factors that can determine 
consumer interest. So that it becomes a suggestion for further research in assessing new products through evaluation 
based on a wider scale of respondents and other factors supporting consumer interest.

Abstract 
 
Analysis of consumers desire is a very important key. based on the analysis of consumer behavior, 
entrepreneurs can plan, improve, and sustain business. This paper wants to explain consumer behavior on 
products from the Apple, US brand in Indonesia. Apple US Brand has been well-known in developing 
technology to enhance products following consumer desires. Therefore, psychologically, product and brand 
quality are thought to play a role in consumer satisfaction. Data was collected through questionnaire answers 
to 210 Apple brand user respondents in the Jakarta area. The data were processed using validity and reliability 
tests.  The analytical method in this study is Robust Least Squared Model. The results of the analysis of this 
study conclude that an increase in product quality and brand quality can significantly increase consumer 
satisfaction. Every 1 unit increase scale in product quality will increase the consumer satisfaction by 0.36 
scale, then every 1 unit increase scale in brand image will increase the consumer satisfaction by 0.45 scale. 
This study suggests that the policy of product research and development, and keeping reputation is crucial in 
all business.

1. Introduction 
Companies that can produce quality goods and services are the hope of many consumers. This is important 
for businessman to do this because by creating quality products, so it will increase public confidence in the products 
produced, and further increase public interest (Purba et al, 2020). Furthermore, the company must also conduct

From the results equation the product quality (PQ) and brand images (BI) affects consumer satisfaction (CS) as the 
foundation of the hiring market strategy in Business. Each increase one scale unit level in product quality will increase 
by 0.36 level of consumer satisfaction preference scale. So, each increase one scale unit level in brand images will 
increase by 0.45 level of consumer satisfaction preference scale. 
6. Conclusion 
Because product quality significantly affects consumer satisfaction, the product quality improvement 
program must be prioritized. Increasing product reliability can be done through increasing the reliability of its 
components for products sold under warranty. This method can reduce warranty costs. The reliability improvement 
that is carried out can reduce the amount of damage during the warranty period, thereby reducing warranty costs. 
Reliability improvements made to product components can improve overall product reliability. Claims that arise due 
to product damage can have a detrimental impact on the consumer, so we must consider the interests of the consumer. 
Increased product durability and premium materials are the key to product quality. 
In this study, brand image significantly affects consumer satisfaction. Efforts to increase brand image need 
to be carried out as follows: promotion, maintaining and enhancing reputation, especially """" the big brand """". 
Companies must also develop sustainable technology and product innovation. Every technological advancement used 
by the company must always be reported as good news to all people. Furthermore, companies must be able to prevent 
consumers from being disappointed in products and services. 
Therefore, product quality and brand image affect consumer satisfaction very significantly. Furthermore, the 
success in creating satisfaction for consumers is the key to success in product marketing. Thus, the market growth 
strategy will be easier to implement if consumers already have adequate satisfaction. Lastly, support from the 
government through policies for business groups is crucial in business, however.

Abstract 
 
Besides purchasing power, knowing buying decisions from consumers is the key to the success of a business. The 
company will be able to carry out business planning and its sustainability. This study wants to know how far the 
buying decision is influenced by customer satisfaction, brand image and country of origin in the Jakarta Region, 
Indonesia. Researchers analyze the behavior of Apple brand users in Indonesia. Data collection was carried out 
by sending research questionnaires electronically to 195 users of the Apple brand in the Jakarta Capital of 
Indonesia. The results of the validity and reliability test conclude that the data is valid and reliable. So, the authors 
want to test how customer satisfaction, brand image and country of origin can support buying decision. The 
econometrics model in this study is the effect of customer satisfaction, brand image and country of origin on 
buying decision on Apple product in Indonesian. The analytical method in this study is Robust Least Squared 
Model. The results of the analysis of this study conclude that an increase in customer satisfaction, brand image 
and country of origin can significantly increase buying decision on Apple product in Indonesia.

1. Introduction 
Efforts to improve a country's performance at a solid level can be through business development. The 
measurement of a country's performance is the gross domestic product which reflects all activities in making goods 
and services (John Tampil Purba & Budiono, 2019). The quantity of real GDP demanded, Y, is the total amount of 
final goods and services produced in Indonesia that people, businesses, governments, and foreigners plan to buy . 
Through the expenditure approach, this quantity of real GDP is the sum of consumption expenditures, C, investment, 
I, government expenditure, G, and net exports, X – M  (Budiono, 2009). That is, Y = C + I + G + X – M. 
Buying plans depend on many factors and some of the main ones are the price level, expectations, fiscal 
policy and monetary policy, and the world economy. Therefore, the aggregate demand curve slopes downward for 
two reasons: wealth effect and substitution effects (Budiono et al, 2020). In other words, this is demand-side

t = 0.000 states that we reject null hypotheses and accept alternative hypotheses. Customer satisfaction (CS)

From the results equation the customer satisfaction (CS), brand images (BI), and country of origin (CO) affects buying 
decision (BD) as the foundation of the hiring market strategy in Business. 
 
Based on the results of the model estimation and measurement, each parameter coefficient can be interpreted 
measuredly. Each increase of a unit level scale of customer satisfaction will increase the buying decision by 0.244 
level of scale. Each increase of a unit level scale of brand images will increase the buying decision by 0.218 level of 
scale. At the last, each increase of a unit level scale country of origin will increase the buying decision by 0.240 level 
of scale. 
6. Conclusion 
  
Because all independent variables affect the buying decision variable positively and significantly, efforts to 
increase consumer satisfaction, brand image and country of origin must be made. With regard to the company must 
be able to meet the expectations and satisfaction of consumers, so explore consumer desires in the form of product 
durability, trends, and innovation. Furthermore, the company must be able to provide products that are superior to 
products of its competitors. Research on the advantages and disadvantages of products compared to competitors' 
products so that companies can improve their products. 
Brand image significantly affects buying decision. Efforts to increase brand image need to be carried out as 
follows: promotion, maintaining and enhancing reputation, especially ""the big brand"". Company must also develop 
sustainable technology and product innovation. Every technological advancement used by the company must always 
be reported as good news to all people. Furthermore, companies must be able to prevent consumers from being 
disappointed in products and services. 
Consideration of the Country of origin is one of the keys that consumers make purchasing decisions. A 
government that focuses on innovation and science and the country itself always maintains a good reputation will have 
a certain image advantage by society. A country known for its manufacturing industry will have certain advantages. 
The status of a country that produces products as a developed country has certain advantages. So, all economic 
decisions on the view of companies and countries are the focus of science and technology and innovation. 
From the results of research and discussion, it can be understood that the experiences of multinational 
companies provide valuable lessons, especially for domestic entrepreneurs. Improving consumers to decide to buy is 
the key to business continuity. We must fix the determining factors which are as follows, consumer satisfaction, brand 
image and country of origin. The government should be able to encourage the development of science and technology 
in the business sectors.

This quantitative research is to find out the effect of the independent variables such as brand innovativeness, brand 
customer orientation, brand self-relevance, and brand social responsibility towards global brand commitment in 
international market. Data collection was done using electronic questionnaire where a series of indicators derived from 
previous research from various scholars were used to assess the perception of respondents towards the research 
variables. 138 respondents that participated in this research are Indonesian citizens that lives in Jakarta area and 
therefore the data gathered from the respondents are further assessed using Stata. The result of measurement for 
hypothesis testing on global brand commitment factors turned out to be supporting the hypothesis and leaving only 
one hypothesis unsupported. At the end, the research has proposed some managerial implications that can be used by 
international brand managers as advice or feedback for their global brand marketing.

1. Introduction 
The world today is in a highly globalized phased where everyone is connected. Therefore, the term 
globalization defines: the relationship in between people is not limited by the borders of nation. From this state, given 
the flexibility and connectivity, international business is formed where any business activities such as sales, marketing, 
investments, transactions, and supply chain can occur in more than one country (Daniels, Radebaugh, & Sullivan, 
2015). For example, I can take place in several countries due to cost factor or it could be because of product 
specialization of a country (Budiono & Purba, 2019). This resembles a global supply chain that involves more than 
one country for a product’s production. The drivers behind this in general is due to several reasons such infrastructure 
development in a country, technical skills of labor and communication development. Consequently, a business should 
decide what type of strategy they will adapt in its international business sector so that it can compete in the highly 
globalized world today (Rosneva & Hraskova (2020); Purba & Budiono (2019); Rajagukguk et al, (2020)). 
There are four business strategy that multinational business can adopt to their international operations. 
International strategy is when a business reproduces their exact core competencies into the foreign market(S. Budiono, 
Purba, & Adirinekso. G.P., 2020). On the other hand, multidomestic strategy is when a business adapts its value and 
activities according to local condition in the foreign market. In a situation when a business decides to create a uniform 
standard across its operation in the foreign market, global strategy is adopted to its international operation. Lastly, 
transnational strategy is a win-win solution where a business emphasizes global integration but also able to capture 
the local values in the foreign market into their core competencies (Daniels et al, (2015); Purba & Panday (2015); 
Budiono & Purba (2020)).

1255","The path in between brand self-relevance and brand commitment represented by the third hypothesis in this 
research has shown to support the hypothesis of the research formulated for the relationship in between the two 
variables. For significancy, the relationship is based on factual data where t-value for this variable linkage is 7.31 
where it is abundantly more than 1.65. It shows that brand self-relevance is significant towards brand commitment.  
 
Since the result of the research conducted successfully supports the hypothesis created in the beginning, it 
proves that the prediction stated at the first place during the hypothesis forming is correct. The hypothesis was 
formulated based on previous research by Larasati & Hananto (2013), where brand self-relevance comes from social 
studies where a person will see that by using certain brand with certain characteristics, it shows or represent the person 
who is using it as it shows attractiveness to the public. In business wise said the researcher shows that by using a 
certain brand, a person would gain social class such as prestigious gain. In this research, this theoretical foundation is 
confirmed by indicators where the indicator describes that the global brand means a lot and it is a big deal for the 
respondent. Therefore, it shows that the respondents are on the same perception of the theory as they think that by 
using that particular global brand in their mind is related to showing prestigious and showing attractiveness to the 
society as it represents one’s characteristic shown by brand self-relevance. 
The fourth hypothesis which is based on the relation path between brand social responsibility and brand 
commitment turns out to be supported in this research. The main reason of the cause of positive relationship is due to 
the factual data obtained from hypothesis testing although the t-value is 1.82 which is greater than 1.65. As a result, 
this condition is considered as a positive relationship. Consequently, the formulation based on the theoretical 
foundation by Fatma, Khan, Rahman, & Pérez (2020) is applicable in the condition of this research.  
 
As the research conducted turns out to be supporting the initial hypothesis, it proves that the prediction or 
formulated hypothesis is correct. The theoretical foundation used to create the hypothesis was based on Fatma, Khan, 
Rahman, & Pérez (2020). The research shows that the customer in the market today start to cares about the 
environment. Thus, they have a concern towards the social environment and the factor and necessity of conducting 
social welfare is starting to be realized by customers. Therefore, the concern of using products or services from a 
brand that fulfills its corporate social responsibilities behavior, respecting the law and is committed towards the social 
welfare shows that the brand is committed due to the effort in terms of building a positive brand image in their 
consumer’s mind and the trust and long-term relationship can be formed. An indicator for social responsibility research 
variables has also shown that customers appreciate the business that respects the local law on social welfare. As a 
conclusion, this shows that the literature review used for this research is valid and shows confirm that the perception 
of people being aware of a brand’s social responsibility activities and action. 
6. Conclusion 
Overall, this research containing four independent variables and one dependent variable participated by 138 
respondents which are Indonesian citizen has drawn the following conclusion based on the significancy level or 
hypothesis analysis towards the proposed hypothesis in the beginning of the study: 
Brand innovativeness has a positive effect towards brand commitment. 
Brand customer orientation have a positive effect towards brand commitment, but it is not significant in 5% 
Brand self-relevance has a positive effect towards brand commitment. 
Brand social responsibility has a positive effect towards brand commitment. 
 
Thus, from the five research variables, managerial implications can be drawn from this research as follows 
especially for international marketing managers who are in responsible in marketing when designing their global brand 
commitment. The data below is based on the context of Indonesian market as all participants are Indonesian citizen:  
• 
Brand commitment: When the customer considers a brand is fully committed and has positive relationship in 
between the customers and the business, therefore the customers are willing to spend or give some effort to retain 
using goods or received services from that brand as the value derived is more than the extra effort spent by the 
customers. 
• 
Brand innovativeness: As some scholars above mentioned that the global brand should be able to capture the 
global trend and create solution towards it, therefore a global brand should be able to provide solution for 
customer and let them rely on it in terms of providing ways to solve problems and providing the solution needed. 
• 
Brand customer orientation: This research shows that the customer in Indonesia demands more than customer 
orientation of a firm that fulfill the needs of the customer based on the discussion and furthermore the customers

standard of their customers. 
• 
Brand self-relevance: The brand should be able to produce value that the customer will consider by using that 
product, it will represent themselves attractive and have in mind that the product from the brand becomes one of 
the best things they consider having in their life. 
• 
Brand social responsibility: The firm or business of the brand should implement or invest in their social 
responsibility areas as one of the ways in it to show its brand commitment. The people are more aware now, 
having a perception towards the need of contributing to the society and also the business needs to consider this 
point as well to comply to local government standard in each international market. Overall, by having a proper 
social responsibility plan and actions, the brand is believed to show their commitment from the customers 
perspective.

Abstract 
 
Marketplace competition in Indonesia has shifted in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Shopee shifted Tokopedia's position at 
the top of customer visits on the website. It causes sales growth at Shopee to increase sharply. The role of brand image 
is one of the highlights expected to encourage customers and potential customers to buy products through Shopee. 
Research on Jakarta workers is interesting to observe, especially millennial generation workers and some generation 
Z.  One hundred twenty urban workers were selected by the purposive sampling method.  SEM implement to test the 
role of brand image in mediating price and sales promotion to purchase decision. 
This study concludes: First, One of the seven hypotheses to be proven. The effect of price on purchasing decisions is 
insignificant. Shopee marketplace prices are uncompetitive compared with the other marketplace, which induces 
consumers to buy a product. Second, the other six hypotheses show an influence on purchasing decisions. Sales 
promotion and brand image have a positive effect on purchasing decisions. Price and sales promotion also affect brand 
image. Third, the brand image becomes a partial mediation for the impact of sales promotion and a complete mediation 
of price variables on Jakarta's urban workers' purchasing decisions.  
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
The development of technology in the digital business world has made significant progress. The presence of 
the marketplace is proof of this technological development. The marketplace is part of e-commerce (Chaffey, 2009). 
Direct involvement of sellers with targeted buyers and the customer community is directly responded to, as direct 
marketing in the digital era (Kotler and Armstrong, 2018). The presence of a marketplace makes transactions more 
accessible, shorter and more effective.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to test the formula for innovative products in developing a business based on customer satisfaction so 
that the products created have the optimal formula and are accepted by consumers. The research was conducted 
through the action research method on the research business with an experimental research approach. The research 
was conducted by experimenting with making innovative products for nine months. There are several consumers 
involved in research to provide input through a survey on the formula for innovation products; data from consumers 
are processed using the satisfaction index. This study indicates that the innovative product with an optimal formula 
can be accepted by the community and can be traded in the market. There are steps taken to determine product 
acceptance, namely product prototyping and product satisfaction testing. This research is useful for companies that 
will make more efficient and effective company operational costs, where it is necessary to carry out the prototyping 
stage and test customer satisfaction with the product.

1. Introduction 
The creative industry in Indonesia is increasingly important in supporting economic prosperity (Hikmawati and 
Alamsyah 2018). Currently, it continues to be developed and becomes the government's attention (Rahmi et al. 2017). 
In supporting the creative industry, of course, entrepreneurs' creativity is needed because entrepreneurial creativity is 
an economic resource (Utama and Ratnapuri 2018). The reason is the twenty-first-century industry will depend on 
products through creativity and innovation (Sutapa, Mulyana, and Wasitowati 2017). Based on the phenomenon of 
economic development, it seems clear that innovation in new products is needed for entrepreneurs in developing their 
products. The creative industry's characteristics in creating work patterns, production, and distribution emphasize 
efficiency and effectiveness (Herrera 2016). The creative era is called the new economy, which puts forward 
information and creativity based on ideas and knowledge from human resources as the main production factors 
(Andjarsari et al. 2013). The creative era is often referred to as the Creative Industry or Creative Economic, while the 
creative economy currently has sixteen sub-sectors that significantly contribute to supporting the national economy, 
including the culinary sector (Sutapa et al. 2017). The culinary sector in 2016 contributed 41.69% of the Gross 
Domestic Product in Indonesia (Utama and Ratnapuri 2018). It seems clear that the development of new products 
through innovation can be done in the culinary field today. In Indonesia, culinary is the most popular part of the 
millennial community; it appears from the buyers who are more dominated by millennials with new and innovative 
products (Setiadi et al. 2018; Wicaksono and Nuvriasari 2012). However, competition is increasingly competitive, 
and businesspeople continue to try to innovate, win the competition, and meet consumer demand through products 
that exceed consumer expectations (Delgado-Verde, Martín-De Castro, and Amores-Salvadó 2016). In this case, there 
is an essential role for an innovation that needs to be done in the culinary field to win the competition by creating 
product innovations (Alamsyah, Syarifuddin, and Mohammed 2018; Herrera 2016). 
The current reality is that innovation can increase the added value of a product, which is one of the sources of company 
growth (Alamsyah et al. 2019; Andjarsari et al. 2013). Creating new products can solve problems or provide better 
solutions to consumer problems. So that entrepreneurs are cautious in creating more innovative products to be accepted 
by the market (Hariyanto and Alamsyah 2019; Herrera 2016). Product innovation is a combination of various

1278","the level of pure satisfaction is obtained because they have just tried the product. There are six questions measured 
through indicators and known from customer satisfaction index data processing to get the total weight results and the 
customer satisfaction scores, namely 437.93 (WT) and 87.59 (CSI). Based on these findings, the consumer satisfaction 
index is acceptable considering that the index is in the category of customer satisfaction.  
 
6. Conclusions 
It is concluded that this study aims to make product prototyping through product innovation and evaluation through 
customer satisfaction. The research object on the Wan Mey Dimsum business is a research business, so the study is 
carried out through action research. The research findings show that to create product innovation, prototyping tests 
can be tested eight times. The Wan Mey Dimsum product can suit consumer desires with the composition in the second 
and eighth test results. Through the composition of the results of the second and eighth tests, these findings can serve 
as a guide in Wan Mey Dimsum's business as well as other new startup businesses. Another finding in the study stated 
that consumer satisfaction at Wan Mey Dimsum through product innovation was accepted. Given that the index of 
processed data from consumers explains product acceptance following consumer expectations. The studies carried out 
certainly have limitations, where the study only focuses on product innovation based on prototyping and satisfaction 
levels based on consumer feasibility indicators. The study was not conducted on larger consumers and did not 
quantitatively assess the impact of product innovation, so that the limitations of this study become suggestions for 
further research.

Abstract 
 
The achievement of an education program can be measured from the results of national examination that is the average 
of national exam score. In Indonesia, it is measured through the average nilai evaluasi belajar tahap akhir 
(EBTANAS) nasional (national exam score)/NEM. The results of national examination are expected to be the portrait 
of the success of government program in education. This study aims to investigate the economic and development 
determinants of NEM in Indonesia. The data used came from the INDODAPOER of the World Bank that covered 440 
districts with complete data in 2009. The dependent variables are the average of NEM at primary, junior secondary, 
and senior secondary level. The independent variables are the economic and development variables: education 
function expenditure and household access to electricity. The data was analyzed using the multivariate multiple 
regression. The results of the study show that education function expenditure and household access to electricity 
statistically have significant effect on education achievement. Better achievement in education is associated with 
higher education function expenditure and household access to electricity.

4. Discussion and Conclusions 
 
The results of this study support findings from previous studies on the importance of economic and development 
factors on education achievement (e.g. Gaudet, 1994; Lee and Barro, 2001; Kagawa and Nakata 2008; Kagawa, 2009). 
Higher education function expenditure will enable district’s governments to provide better education services, such 
as (i) quality teachers with better income and (ii) quality education facilities, such as quality school buildings and 
equipment including those that respond to Industrial Revolution 4.0, as well as art, culture, and sport facilities that are 
needed by the young generation to exert their wills to the full highest. These all will improve education achievement 
in a district. Meanwhile, household access to electricity will allow students to study at home optimally and to access 
additional education materials from other sources, such as from the Internet. This access will, in turn, certainly, 
improve education achievement. 
 
Based on the findings from this study, in order to improve education achievement, it is therefore recommended that 
the district governments should increase the education function expenditure allocation and household access to 
electricity in their districts.

1. Introduction  
The economic growth of a country is an important indicator that shows the success and impact of implementing 
economic development policies (Budiono & Purba, 2019, Purba and Budiono 2019). The development of 
information technology is one of the driving forces for the entry of foreign products into the country, with the 
development of this technology, the emergence of the Internet, with this internet, it will be very easy for local people 
to access things that are outside the country (Purba & Panday; Panday & Purba, 2015, Aileen, et al 2019, Purba, et al 
2020). The goods and services transactions in a large number in the region and internationally scale will support the 
national economic growth as well as the global economic development (Budiono & Purba, Purba & Budiono, 2019, 
2020). In accordance with the times where the current generation has a lot of people who adopt a healthy lifestyle 
but with various kinds of lifestyles. This is also due to the ease of transactions with adequate information technology 
(Aileen, et al 2019, Adirinekso, et al 2020, Purba, et al 2020). Of course, to live a lifestyle with a situation like this,

perception and brand image on buyer's decision. These results are supported by the results of research by Widyastuti 
and Said (2017) which state that brand image, product design and price perception have a positive and significant 
effect on buyer decisions. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
Based on research that has been done that, 1) Product quality has a positive and significant effect on purchasing 
decisions for Adidas running shoes. This is based on the results of hypothesis testing in table xxx which shows that 
the variable product quality has an influence on the purchase decision of Adidas running shoes by 46.7%. These 
results indicate that the increasing quality of the product will increase buyer decisions. 2) Price perception has a 
positive and significant effect on buyer's decision. This is based on the results of hypothesis testing in table xxx 
which shows that the price perception variable has an influence on the purchase decision of Adidas running shoes by 
28.9%. 3) Brand image has a positive and significant effect on buyer decisions. This is based on the results of 
hypothesis testing in table xxx which shows that the brand image variable has an influence on the purchase decision 
of Adidas running shoes by 46%. The results of this study are supported by the results of previous studies that have 
been conducted regarding the effect of brand image on purchasing decisions. 4) Product quality, price perception 
and brand image simultaneously have a significant and positive influence on buyer policy. This is based on the 
results of the F test which shows a sign value of 0.000 <0.05. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis 
and previous researchers who said there was a significant positive effect of product quality variables, price 
perception and brand image on the decision of buyers of Adidas Running shoes in Jakarta. 
 
Limitations and Suggestions  
Based on the conclusions that have been generated from this study, the author's suggestions for other researchers and 
the government are as follows: 
1. Subsequent research can add other independent variables, so that the coefficient of determination can 
increase the percentage of research results.  
2. In addition, in this study statistically there is not enough evidence to accept the hypothesis that price 
perceptions have a positive and significant effect on purchasing decisions. Subsequent research must 
be able to obtain supporting data to accept this hypothesis.

Abstract 
 
Every planet in the universe has its own characteristics. These features make the planets different among 
themselves. For this reason, all the different properties of the planets must be evaluated at the same time in 
determining habitable planets. This situation requires a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. In this 
study, a list of habitable planets (nine planets and the Moon) has been considered. Seventeen different criteria such 
as mass, gravity, diameter, density, escape velocity, rotation time, day of length, distance from sun, perihelion, 
aphelion, orbital period, orbital velocity, orbital inclination, orbital eccentricity, obliquity to orbit, mean temperature 
and number of satellites are taken into account. The weights of criteria are determined with DEMATEL (The 
Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) by analyzing the interactions among criteria. Orbital inclination 
is the criterion with the highest weight and the criterion with the lowest weight is the number of satellites. After 
weighting the criteria with DEMATEL, VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) and 
TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference to Similarity to Ideal Solution) approaches are used to rank the planets. 
According to the TOPSIS, Earth is ranked first, Venus ranked second and Mercury ranked third in the order of the 
most habitable planets. According to the VIKOR method, Earth is ranked first, Mars ranked second and Mercury 
ranked third in the order of the most habitable planets. Finally, the same calculations are done considering with 
equal weights and the results are discussed.

1. Introduction 
There are many planets in the solar system. Although Earth is currently known as the only planet with life, people 
have sought different habitats for many years. Whether there is life on the moon and other planets has always been a 
matter of wonder. Certain criteria Earth has for the existence of life is important. Many criteria such as a planet's 
mass, gravity, distance from the sun, and period speed are criteria that affect life. These criteria that every planet has 
are unique. The multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methods should be used to analyze the planets in terms of 
habitability according to these criteria.  
 
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Moon are taken into consideration as 
alternatives in this study. A total of 17 different criteria such as mass, diameter, distance to the sun, average 
temperature, gravity, orbital velocity were weighted using the DEMATEL method. Using these weights, TOPSIS 
and VIKOR methods were applied and the planets were ranked. At the same time, the same procedures were done 
by taking the weights equal.

When the space problems in the literature are examined, no study has been found with multi-criteria decision 
making methods. For this reason, it is thought that this study will contribute to the field by creating an alternative to 
the existing methods. Considering the factors that are effective in choosing the most habitable planet in future 
studies on the subject, continuity of studies can be ensured. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this study, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods were used to evaluate habitable planets and the results were compared. 
DEMATEL method was used to determine the criterion weights. According to the DEMATEL-TOPSIS methods, 
Earth ranked first, Venus ranked second and Mercury ranked third in the ranking of the most habitable planets. With 
the DEMATEL-VIKOR method, Earth ranked first, Mars ranked second, and Mercury ranked third in the list of 
habitable planets. TOPSIS and VIKOR methods were also applied by taking the criterion weights equal. According 
to the TOPSIS method, Earth is in the first place, Venus is in the second and Mercury is in the third place. Since the 
first and second conditions could not be met in the VIKOR method with equal criteria weights, the best alternative 
could not be determined. After this study, MCDM methods can be used to analyze nutrients that can be grown on 
planets. These methods can also be applied in the selection of astronauts with different characteristics to be sent to 
space.

Abstract 
 
National family planning program and other development programs have contributed to the decline of fertility and 
mortality levels and in turn population growth in Indonesia (Samosir 1992; Haub 1989). Under the New Order regime, 
in Indonesia, family planning program was initiated and supported centrally by the government. However, in the 
Reformed era, family planning program is decentralized to the district government. Central government still provides 
districts with Specific Allocation Grant (Dana Alokasi Khusus/DAK) to support population development including 
family planning program. This study aims to examine the association between specific allocation grant for population 
development and population growth rate in Indonesia. The data used came from INDODAPOER of the World Bank 
in 2009 covering 372 districts in Indonesia. The dependent variable in this study was the population growth rate during 
2010–2015. The independent variables were the total DAK for population development, net enrollment ratio (NER) 
of primary school, and household expenditure for the poorest 20 percent. The data was analyzed using a multiple 
linear regression. The results of the study show that lower population growth rate was associated with larger DAK for 
population development, higher NER of primary school, and lower household expenditure for the poorest 20 percent. 
 
Keywords 
Total Specific Allocation Grant, Population development, Population growth, District, Indonesia. 
 
1. Introduction 
The General Stipulation Article 1 point 3 of Law No. 33/2004 of the Republic of Indonesia states that fiscal balance 
between the Central Government and Regional Administrations is a just, proportional, democratic, transparent, and 
efficient financial allocation system for funding decentralization implementation taking into account the regional 
potency, condition, and need, as well as deconcentration and assistance task (Republik Indonesia 2004). One form of 
that fiscal balance is that the Government of Indonesia provides Dana Alokasi Khusus (Specific Allocation 
Fund/DAK) to districts (kabupaten/kota) that comes from the State Budget that is allocated with a purpose to fund 
specific activities that are region’s affairs according to the national priority (Republik Indonesia 2004 and 2020).   
 
DAK are divided into two types, that is physical and nonphysical. Among physical DAK is operational assistance 
fund for family planning activities (Article 1 No. 16, Republik Indonesia 2020). This fund is used to increase family 
planning participation and to improve the even quality of and access to family planning services. In this paper this 
fund is called Total Specific Allocation Grant for population development (in IDR Billion). Indeed, family planning 
prevalence is a result of funding source from the government (Lee et al. 2009; United Nations 2012; Muhoza et al. 
2013).  
 
Family planning program was initially conducted in 1950s – 1980s in some developing countries. This program was 
one of important social experiments in the period after the World War II. Although the implementation and analysis 
were very complex, it resulted in the best talent of human race to be demographers, that involved multidisciplinary 
sciences, and resulted lower population growth rate than before (Robinson and Ross 2007). Family planning program 
produced for the first time in human history where a world with health, education, and fulfilling opportunities could 
happen safely for all people in the world. 
 
The success of national family planning program and other development programs have contributed to the decline of 
fertility and mortality and as a consequence the decline in population growth rate (Haub 1989). Government program

6. Conclusion 
The results of this study confirm the importance of Total Specific Allocation Grant (DAK) for population development 
in reducing population growth rate even after controlling for the effects of education achievement and poverty. It 
means that the availability of DAK for population development is a smart strategy to manage population growth rate 
in districts in Indonesia so that the regional government can promote the improvement of human welfare in their 
districts. The availability of DAK for population development can be used to enhance access to even and affordable 
quality family planning services and information in districts so that fertility and mortality level and hence population 
growth rate can also be managed. 
 
The significant effect of education achievement and poverty also imply that in order to manage population growth 
rate, universal primary education and the elimination of poverty should be attained. Access to education can lead to 
the postponement of age at first marriage and birth and increase woman’s participation in the labor force and then 
decline of number of children and lower population growth rate. Meanwhile, lower poverty suggests higher aspiration 
toward the smaller quantity of children and higher quality of children and hence lower fertility and population growth 
rate.

Abstract 
 
Supply chains are encountering more uncertain conditions and risks. Disruptions that impede the flow of material 
through a supply chain that can also result in failure to deliver end goods are a significant category of risks. The 
consequence of the Covid-19 outbreak has led to shut down production in the supply chain system, resulting in 
significant impediments for many foreign supply-dependent enterprises. The constraints cause substantial 
disruptions of the supply chain, production delays, and supplier delays. In recent years, managing supply chain 
risks has been given more importance to protect supply chains from interruptions by forecasts and prevention. 
The effects of disruptions on logistics, costs, demand, profits, and inventory levels of the supply chain are 
analyzed. SVM is one of the most convenient and effective supervised learning algorithms commonly used for 
classification and regression challenges. This paper presents a modernistic machine learning model, multi-
category support vector machines (MC-SVM) algorithm through training on selected samples. In order to abet 
MC-SVM model to perform well on imbalanced data, k-means clustering algorithm has been proposed to classify 
clusters of nodes at-disruption, which share similar interruption profiles and can find the relationships between 
the data object, provide massive information and contribute significantly to accelerating classification and 
prediction of  the SVM model. Data from portfolios of different firms in pharmaceutical industry has been used 
to train the MC-SVM model which maps the economic performance of a firm to a certain type of supply chain 
disruption (SCD). The potentiality of this research will privilege better management of the supply chain and thus 
will permit a network to approach faster response times to the customer, lower costs in all respects of the chain 
and to the end customer terrific levels of stretch-ability, lower inventories throughout the chain, and diminished 
the bottleneck effect in the supply chain logistics.

1.Introduction 
 
The COVID 19 pandemic has escalated into the terrible health crisis of the 21st Century. As the global figure of 
Covid-19 infected physiques is still continuously progressing, including predictions tending to millions of existing 
cases at its zenith and with every case requiring similar daily dosages during the processing stage, there is a 
requirement for pharmaceutical firms to raise production (Yu, Razon, and Tan 2020).A pharmaceutical supply 
chain is a vital element of the health system in providing remedies,  especially in the nations where the local 
pharmaceutical firms provide fundamental drugs. More than 82% of drug (in terms of volume) is supplied by local 
manufacturers in Bangladesh. In this meaning, any hazards affecting the pharmaceutical companies could disrupt 
medicines' supply and hit the health system performance. But no earlier investigations exist estimating 
uncertainties and disorders in pharmaceutical firms while appraising the pharmaceutical supply chain. Any 
contingencies influencing the pharmaceutical corporations could interrupt supply drugs and health system 
capability (Jaberidoost et al. 2015).

The np control chart is used to assess if there are a consistent number of defective detection in the cluster of items 
over time. The average is the centerline. Stable relationships are shown in the np chart for error analysis. UCL and 
LCL set first control limits, and no sample is found outside the UCL and LCL ranges. For error analysis, 100 
samples are taken. Each sample has been tested 100 times. By setting all the sample in the graph chart, no outside 
range sample data is seen in figure 5, so the result is not out of statistical control. A hundred samples are taken for 
error analysis. Setting all the sample in the graph chart, no outside range sample data is seen, so the developed 
model is not out of statistical control.

6. Conclusion and Future Research 
Covid-19 has caused a disruptive crisis in the supply chain which is why it is important to identify the types of 
disruption. In this paper, we used an MC-SVM and k-means clustering approach to recognize a particular type of 
disruption a firm is facing. To train the model, data collected from firms that faced critical disruptions were 
matched to a certain type of disruption matching their portfolios. Focusing on particular type disruption data was 
divided into 4 cluster types categorizing similar types as one. Then they were divided into multiclass by using the 
SVM model. Test datasets were used to find out the accuracy, random datasets caused varying accuracy. In this 
paper, we recognized the particular disruption a firm is facing. Identifying disruption type helps to focus on a 
certain aspect of the supply chain rather than the overall supply chain. This can help a firm to focus on decision 
making, to accurate corrective measure on certain criteria & necessary steps can be taken accordingly, also a 
known disruption type will help to respond quickly to take precaution & improve the certain aspect which needs

economic productivity certainty of a firm. The results could have been more accurate if the data weren’t 
insufficient. Increasing data will help to improve the accuracy of the model also more features could be used for 
better accuracy. The model can only identify a certain type of disruption a firm is facing, the combination of 
multiple disruptions cannot be identified by this model. Our model cannot identify a combination of multiple 
disruptions, so if a firm is facing multiple type disruption then it is not possible to identify in this model, only a 
certain type that is causing the main disruption in the chain will be identified, so using a more improvised model 
of machine learning can be incorporated in support of this model in future researches. It is recommended that 
future research may irradicate the limitations in this paper by adding more features and providing large data will 
improve the accuracy of the model. More supervised and improved machine learning algorithms can be used for 
further improvement & to lessen the errors.

1. Introduction  
The journey of Bank Central Asia or commonly referred to as BCA began in 1957 in Jakarta. Since its 
establishment, BCA has grown to become one of the largest banks in Indonesia with the hard work of its 
employees and the support of its loyal customers to provide solutions or services that facilitate various banking 
transactions and this company from family business became big holding company of Salim groups (Suk, et al, 
2019). Bank BCA which has been established for a long time is supported by small entrepreneurs, especially 
small and medium entrepreneurs from various ethnic groups in Indonesia almost Chinese Indonesian generations 
(Tan, et al 2019, Purba and Tan 2018). The categories of products and services provided by BCA are as follows; 
deposit products, credit cards, credit facilities, banking transaction services, cash management services, banc 
assurance products, bank guarantees, export import financing, foreign exchange facilities, electronic banking, 
domestic documented letters of credit, mutual fund investment products, and bond investment products and the 
customers are ready using those technologies. This bank now becomes the big company that uses modern e-
banking technologies, and most of the consumers are in the readiness use the technology provided by this bank 
(Kamaludin and Purba, 2015, Radnan and Purba, 2018).  
 
With the slogan ""Always by Your Side"", BCA will continue to strive to provide the best services and solutions 
for its customers. BCA continues to innovate to make it easy for customers to make transactions anytime and 
anywhere (Purba, et al 2020a, 2020b). The latest innovation in 2019 is the BCA keyboard, which provides direct 
access to banking transaction services via the online chat platform and opening accounts via BCA Mobile and 
WELMA, which are mobile apps for wealth management. In this all-digital era, the customer experience is

1326","To convey the uniqueness and value of a brand to customers, brand communication is needed. Customers are more 
likely to trust a brand that has a good reputation. Brand communication can have a strong effect on brand loyalty 
through brand image or reputation (Chinomona, 2016). Brand communication plays a very important role in 
determining brand trust because at an early stage consumers do not have information based on concrete experiences, 
so they do not have a basis for making expectations. That way, the way of communication really determines how the 
progress of the relationship with customers will be (Gretry, Horváth, Belei, and van Riel, 2017). "" 
 
Service Quality has a positive effect on Brand Loyalty (H5) 
Hypothesis 5 says that service quality has an influence on brand loyalty. The C.R value obtained from data 
processing for the effect of service quality variables on brand loyalty is 2,972 with a P value of 0.011. As a result, it 
was obtained a test value of ≥2.00 for CR and ≤0.05 for the P value, which fulfilled the requirements. So, it can be 
concluded that hypothesis 5 is accepted. 
Quality of service is one of the alternatives to increase loyalty. Bank managers who manage all business processes to 
create customer perceptions of high service quality can increase loyalty because customers become more satisfied 
(Ngo and Nguyen 2016). This research is in line with research conducted by Pramana and Rastini (2016) who also 
state that service quality has a positive and significant impact on customer loyalty through trust. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The results of the research and analysis that have been carried out will be concluded based on the following 
research hypothesis: 
a.) Hypothesis 1 shows that brand communication has an influence on brand trust. The C.R value obtained 
from data processing for the influence of brand communication variables on brand trust is 2.298 with a P 
value of 0.022. The beta coefficient value is 0.120, meaning that an increase in every one point of brand 
communication will increase by 0.120 points of brand trust.  
b.) Hypothesis 2 says that service quality has an influence on brand trust. The C.R value obtained from data 
processing for the influence of service quality variables on brand trust is 8.112 with a P value of 0.000. The 
beta coefficient value is 0.997, meaning that an increase in every one point of service quality will increase 
by 0.997 points of brand trust.  
c.) Hypothesis 3 says that brand trust has an influence on brand loyalty. The C.R value obtained from data 
processing for the influence of brand trust variables on brand loyalty is 4,477 with a P value of 0,000. The 
beta coefficient value is 0.638, meaning that an increase in every one point of brand trust will increase by 
0.638 points of brand loyalty.  
d.) Hypothesis 4 says that brand communication has an influence on brand loyalty. The C.R value obtained 
from data processing for the influence of brand communication variables on brand loyalty is 1,991 with a P 
value of 0.148. The beta coefficient value is 0.148, meaning that an increase in every one point of brand 
communication will increase by 0.148 points of brand loyalty. 
e.) Hypothesis 5 says that service quality has an influence on brand loyalty. The C.R value obtained from data 
processing for the effect of service quality variables on brand loyalty is 2,972 with a P value of 0.011. The 
beta coefficient value is 0.060, meaning that an increase in every one point of service quality will increase 
by 0.060 points of brand loyalty. 
Thus, it can be concluded that this banking company must take into account the things from the results of the above 
hypothesis 1 brand communication has an influence on brand trust results, hypothesis 2, service quality has an 
influence on brand trust, hypothesis 3, brand trust has an influence on brand loyalty, hypothesis 4 says that brand 
communication has an influence on brand loyalty and hypothesis 5 says that service quality has an influence on 
brand loyalty. The bank company has to maintain and improve the performances of all variables as stated above for 
the sake of the company sustain and growth.

So that it is expected to make it easier to determine a representative sample of the population. 
b.) In future research, it can be expanded by adding independent variables that affect brand loyalty.

Abstract 
  
The apparel industry of Bangladesh has been the leading export division and the preeminent source of foreign 
exchange. However, these industries are still confronting obstacles such as insufficient productivity, poor quality, 
higher defects rate which is reducing its output to a significant extent. Minimization of defects by identifying the 
causes in various sections of these industries can significantly improve its productivity. This study emphasizes on 
identifying the root causes of sewing defects in an apparel firm and proposed auspicious corrective actions to 
reduce these defects. This study is carried out at Fakir Apparels Limited to minimize the defects rate in its sewing 
section. Pareto analysis has been performed to identify the most significant one among all the defects in two 
production lines and root causes of these defects have been analyzed by the cause-effect diagram. Moreover, a 
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle has been designed to establish the corrective actions based on the root cause 
analysis. Finally, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a multi criteria 
decision making (MCDM) technique has been used to rank and recommend different managerial decisions based 
on their priority and impact. The outcome of this study may bring significant changes in the sewing section of the 
apparel firm in terms of productivity and effectiveness.

1. Introduction  
There have been many improvements in international trade agreements for apparel products over the last decade, 
creating new challenges and opportunities for Bangladesh's export-oriented apparel industry. Moreover, many 
domestic challenges are also prevalent. Ready-made Apparel is one of the sections of the garments sector's pack 
at present. On the contrary, without the sewing process, the ready-made garment is totally incomplete. But it is 
true that, in this part, we often do not get the expected outcome. It is due to lack of proper ability, process disruption 
and inappropriate adjustment of the machine. Fault has occurred due to these obscurities and impacts on 
consistency, productivity, cost and even production. Minimization of rework is mostly important for reducing 
scrap, rework and additional processing. Quality requirements are also part of a company's normal operating,

1337","5. Conclusion and Future work 
Quality defects are considered a major concern not only in apparel manufacturing industries but also almost in 
every sector of industries where consumers endeavor it. For the apparel industry, quality is assessed in terms of 
quality and standard of fibers, fabric quality, designs, and the finished garments. However, these defects in the 
product usually lead to rework, scrap, reject, additional processing time, and customer dissatisfaction which is not 
beneficial for a growing industry. This study has investigated and analyzed the sewing defects in an apparel firm 
employing Total quality management (TQM) tools such as Pareto chart, cause-effect diagram, PDCA cycle, and 
a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique referred Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution 
(TOPSIS). The Pareto chart reveals that the major cumulative sewing defects such as raw edge (41.6%), 
broken/open stitch (32.8%), uncut loose thread (29.9%), wavy (22.5%) and skip stitch (22.5%). Employing a 
cause-effect diagram, the root causes of each sewing defect has been identified, and several corrective actions 
have been recommended to defeat those defects. Moreover, a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle has been 
established to propose a continual improvement of these defects. For emphasizing more importance on proposed 
managerial decisions, a TOPSIS approach has been employed to systematize those decisions in order. This 
managerial preference will help management to implement effective decisions for minimizing sewing defects. 
This study has been conducted on a particular section of the apparel manufacturing firm, while it can be extended 
considering other areas of this industry. A quality assurance system can also be incorporated for trailing the 
improvement after implementing the proposed remedial actions. In terms of efficiency and effectiveness, the 
consequence of this study can help the sewing section to focus more on concerning areas that bring significant 
advances in the sewing section of the apparel business.

Abstract 
 
The Traveloka Pay later card's launch in September 2019 by Traveloka collaborates with Bank BRI to improve digital 
payment services. The last digital payment service expects to increase the number of members to reach 5 million by 
2025, considering that BRI is the bank with the most extensive network. It is interesting to know Traveloka customers' 
behaviour to switch for the new product.  A research survey was conducted in Jakarta in March 2020. This study uses 
a push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework to show the Traveloka customer switching behaviour determinants from pay 
later to pay later card.  SEM conducted on data from 1117 workers using pay later card in Jakarta province.  HCM 
was used to prove the impact of second-order variables on switching intention.  This study shows that only pull 
variables in the second-order cause switching intention from pay later to pay later card.  Even though the aesthetic 
design explains the push effect, Inertia and perceived substitutability caused a mooring effect, but those cannot explain 
the switching intention.  Only pull-effect as a latent variable of economic benefit, convenience for a transaction, 
gamification, and locatability cause switching intention significantly. For future research, comparing four types of 
HCM are essentials to select suitable ones.

1. Introduction 
At present, when the digital era covers all aspects of life, including in business, mainly when it associated 
with the COVID-19 pandemic, it dramatically affects the dynamics of business development. For this reason, the 
business sector must innovate marketing strategies related to the trend of digital mobile services (Heo & Kim, 2017).   
Traveloka made changes to the payment method in its business. If previously Traveloka customers used the pay later 
application, then in September 2019, collaborating with Bank BRI, one of the banks with the broadest network in 
Indonesia, issued a pay later card (www.tirto.id, 2020). This development occurred because of the emphasis on service  
convenience (Adirinekso G. , Purba, Budiono, & Rajagukguk, 2020), especially in the e-business sector (Purba, 
Budiono, Rajagukguk, Samosir, & Adirinekso, 2020). 
Credit cards designed to make it easier for users. Besides being practical and can be used in an emergency, 
the transaction tool can also help users evaluate their expenses. The bank will send a bill to users to judge for what 
purposes they spent.  However, in many ways, convenience also has an unfortunate effect. Without accurate 
transaction notification — things that then make users unaware of the number of transactions — and the need to pay 
an annual fee are examples of how having a credit card is often considered a boomerang by its users.

Abstract  
 
Police officers are first responders, therefore shift work in this sector is imperative in order to ensure 24/7 coverage. 
The demanding nature of the pressing work schedules may have physiological, psychological, or other mental impacts 
on the workforce. Hence, it’s necessary to study the association between the shift work and stress, sleep quality, and 
cognitive performance within the workforce. Data were obtained from 307 participants working in Sharjah Police. In 
this study, stress was assessed using 22 items from Spielberger Police Stress Survey, respondents indicated the level 
of perceived stress on a 5-point Likert scale during a three months period. The sleep quality was assessed using 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) through a questionnaire that included 12 items, where respondents were 
required to indicate the hours of their daily sleep during the three months period and rate the extent to which a number 
of different factors affected their sleep on a 4-point Likert scale. Furthermore, cognitive performance was assessed 
using 10 items from Cognitive Functioning Self-Assessment Scale (CFSS) Questionnaire, where respondents are 
required to rate different events’ frequencies on a 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis is conducted using SPSS 
where analysis of variance is utilized. Results showed important correlations between shiftwork and sleep quality, 
while shiftwork impact on stress, and cognitive performance of the participants is found to be insignificant.

1. Introduction  
Shift work is a pattern where work differs from the traditional working day and week, in which the employee on the 
next shift takes over the same role within a 24-hr period (Richbell and Chan, 2011). Shifts have become prevalent in 
many developed countries (Drake and Wright, 2011). It is crucial in many sectors to provide services across all 24 
hours of the day throughout the week, including protective service providers such as police workforce and other 
emergency responders who make sure to provide communities with adequate safety and security. Due to the distinctive 
nature of responsibilities among the different police workforce departments (e.g., patrol officers have different 
responsibilities than those of jailers), multiple shift rosters were set, and were also affected by other variables such as 
number of staff and demand for service. Despite the fact that shift work is an essential element of the vocation, there 
is increasing evidence in recent studies that shift work could result in fatigue, sleep disorders, occupational stress, 
health issues, social lives, psychological and physiological disturbance...etc. 
 
Shift workers are required to reschedule their sleeping pattern where their sleeping and awakening times are constantly 
changing, which can result in a circadian rhythm disruption (Violanti et al., 2008). Generally, humans’ circadian 
timings are mainly affected by environmental lightning exposure, where morning light boost rhythms and evening 
light delays them (Boivin et al., 1996; Minors et al., 1991). This disruption can lead to mood changes, abnormal 
hormone rhythms, cognitive function impairment (Horne, 2007), and other health issues such as cardiovascular 
diseases, diabetes (Guo et al., 2013)), obesity, metabolic syndrome (Karlsson et al., 2001), and cancer (Haus and 
Smolensky, 2013). Yazdi et al. (2014) found that shift workers are more susceptible to insomnia, poor sleep quality, 
and daytime sleepiness. Working rotating shifts or night schedules is associated with insomnia and excessive

5. Conclusion  
This study presented the relationship between shift work and stress, sleep quality, and cognitive performance among 
Sharjah Police officers. In the present study, the association of shift work and stress severity in the past three months 
was examined using Spielberger Police Stress Survey. As well as the association of shift work and sleep quality in the 
past three months using PSQI. Cognitive performance (in the past three months) and shift work association was also 
tested. Results have shown that shift work is only associated with poorer sleep quality among officers. It can be 
concluded that shift work has no effect on stress levels among Sharjah Police officers, while it cannot be concluded 
that there’s an association between shift status and cognitive performance. Further future research should be carried 
out to investigate why the influence of sleep poorer quality in the current studied sample - if taken as an independent 
factor – has no significant influence on both stress and cognitive performance as may usually be expected (Alhola and 
Polo-Kantola P. 2007, Bendak and Rashid 2020). An early explanation can be highlighted as the overall elevated 
positive organizational culture and technology-empowered work environment, which can help reduce work stresses 
and support better cognitive performance respectively.  
All three measured variables as well as shift work information were all obtained utilizing self-reporting method which 
involves a high risk of bias. Objective measures could be utilized to study stress, sleep quality, and cognitive 
performance along with the subjective self-reporting. Furthermore, a comparison between different shift rosters can 
be conducted in order to differentiate between the impact of each roster in order to help shift managers to set an 
optimum shift schedule that will increase productivity and reduce health risks. Moreover, further analysis of covariate 
such as gender, rank, and age might have an effect on the correlation between shift work and the other variables.

Abstract 
 
COVID-19 pandemic has significantly interrupted the global production and supply chain operation in all aspects 
of the consumer market. Along with other domains, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced its outbreaks on 
supply chain drivers impacting sustainable production and consumption patterns during the post-pandemic era. 
This motive stimulated the necessity for analyzing supply chain disruptions that severely affected logistics, 
procurement, production and distribution in the supply chain. Elimination of these disruptions in the supply chain 
may depend on many critical drivers which can accelerate the implementation of sustainability thus enhancing the 
performance of the supply chain in the context of an impending environment. In order to improve the resilience 
and performance of the supply chain, this study identifies and addresses those critical drivers and characterizes 
them based on their percentage implemented by Pareto analysis. Furthermore, a grey based Decision Making Trial 
and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model is proposed to establish the causal relationships among these 
critical drivers. The findings of this work will demonstrate the structure and interrelationships between drivers 
and identify the most critical drivers for a long term sustainability of supply chain to eliminate disruptions in the 
supply chain. The findings can pave a way to business managers, policymakers and other stakeholders in 
numerous industries to identify critical drivers in attaining undisrupted business environment in the pandemic 
context.

1. Introduction  
A global life threatening pandemic known as COVID-19 has globally affected all aspects of our life. In the course 
of a year, global economy has witnessed a severe shock due to disruptions in all sort of operations and business 
practices. Supply chain practice has been massively disrupted in all stages including procurement, operations, 
distribution and other services. Business organizations have been facing a huge challenges to maintain a fluent 
supply chain across different stages due to unprecedented disease outbreaks in recent decades thorough out the 
world. This pandemic has made substantial negative impacts on businesses and supply chains, including reducing 
their efficiency and performance (Guan et al., 2020; Sodhi, 2016) and propagating disruptions across the supply 
chains that widely affect their resilience and sustainability (Ivanov, 2020). 
Pharmaceutical industry with their effort to supply medicine and medical equipment is always in a top priority in 
this COVID1-9 situation. The demand for necessary items such as personal protective equipment (PPE), 
ventilators, and dried and canned foods have been added on the top of regular medicines. However, the firms are 
continuously facing numerous challenges that reduce their capacities. border closures, lockdown in the supply 
market, interruption in vehicle movements and international trade, labor shortage, and the maintaining of physical 
distance in manufacturing facilities are some of the major crisis these pharmaceutical firms are facing during the 
pandemic (Paul and Chowdhury, 2020). It is quite evident that due to these multidimensional impacts on supply 
chains, along with other economic and financial challenges (Dontoh et al., 2020), the pandemic has had a severe 
effect on global pharmaceutical supply chain.

consumer behavior in the vulnerable market situation under COVID-19 (X12). Nevertheless, Building a rigid 
legislation facility (X4) all the vital stakeholder will allow the firms to plan an efficient risk management capacity 
which can withstand all the unwanted supply chain disruptions due to a global pandemic(X18). 
 
6. Conclusion 
COVID-19 has thrown a huge challenge to the decision makers to make major decisions in the disrupted supply 
chain environment. Sustainability and performance of supply chain in pharmaceutical firms are at stake. On the 
other hand, to battle the casualty of the pandemic, pharmaceutical firms are one of the most important sectors to 
perform their operations, distributions, logistics and inventory management more responsively to better cater their 
consumers. As a result, It has become a prime task for the decision makers to explore and prioritize the most 
critical supply chain drivers which if adopted and executed in the supply chain practice will facilitate the firms to 
better perform between stages, respond quickly changes and run the operations efficiently with all the strategy to 
withstand disruptions caused by COVID-19. The purpose of this study was mainly to help the supply chain 
decision makers by providing them insights about the impactful drivers in supply chain, there level of prominence 
and most importantly to show the interrelationships between these critical driver. This study may help them to 
recognize the cause-effect relationship between these drivers. Decision makers, from the insights, can differentiate 
the drivers that effect the other drivers and prioritize them accordingly while implementing. We used a grey-based 
DEMATEL approach to establish the interrelationships between the drivers. 
However, there are inevitable limitations in this research which can be addressed in the future works. While 
developing the relationships, only ten drivers were considered to explore which might not always be enough for 
the decision makers if there is a heavily damaged business scenario in a firm. Opinions and recommendations 
from more experts could result in a more comprehensive findings from the research. Data and information from 
more studies could allow a broader generalization of the outputs. Using DEMATEL method might not ensure a 
consistent comparison between pairs. Other fuzzy techniques could have been incorporated in the model. Drivers 
can be assessed with relative weight and prioritization. Apart from these limitations, this hybrid approach of grey 
based DEMATEL model handles the complexity of the problem and effectively evaluated the interdependencies 
between the drivers which will be beneficial for supply chain decision makers to fight COVID-19.

Abstract  
 
The Automotive Industry has entered a period of rapid change. Technological advances have given rise to 
many new profit models from the automobile, which has created massive corporate growth potential. 
Consumer expectations have also changed, pushing Automotive companies into a new business territory. 
While external factors have transformed, are Automotive companies organized to innovate within their 
industry and create profits from these new expectations? In this paper the author examines a history of the 
organizational framework used in the Auto Industry to help answer this central question. Additionally, 
through a survey of industry professionals, this paper will examine current organizational structure within 
automotive companies and link the results to possible explanations of innovation. Chi Squared Goodness-
to-Fit models are developed to show trends of innovation within the survey data. The study of innovation 
within the Automotive Industry is an important consideration as it will help industry leaders harness the 
benefits of an innovative workforce.

1. Introduction  
The Automotive (Auto) Industry is said to be in unprecedented times. According to Bill Ford, Executive Chairman of 
Ford Motor Company, “this time is unlike any other Ford has experienced. The same is true for the rest of the (Auto) 
Industry”. Over the last 100 years, there has not been any period of innovation and accelerated development like the 
last decade, and there is no anticipated end to this acceleration. One central question to the auto industry is the 
organizational infrastructure of current automotive companies, are they structured to innovate? Through research on 
current organization structures, it appears the Automotive industry widely uses a matrix organization structure, and 
that structure is not the correct organizational structure to promote innovation. To prove this hypothesis, this report 
will examine survey results from professionals in the automotive Industry.  
 
Innovation implies new activities that would result in new added value to the business ecosystem that includes 
suppliers, producers and consumers (Edison, Ming, 2010). This definition is used to help answer the central question; 
do auto companies have the correct organizational infrastructure to promoted innovation? To investigate the 
hypothesis further, an Industry study was conducted across 37 automotive professionals.  
 
1.1 Problem Statement  
From the literature review, the problem statement becomes clear. Unless the Auto Industry changes the fundamental 
organizational structure that has been in place for decades, the industry will continue to have trouble with capturing 
and profiting from innovative ideas. In order to be successful, Auto Companies need to find a place in the future 
where they play to their strengths and capture innovative ideas.  The hypothesis of this paper suggests that 
traditional Auto Company are not set up for innovation, as the Matrix Organization of these traditional businesses 
will not create an environment for innovation. This hypothesis is expanded upon because the matrix organization is 
not the sole limiting factor for innovation. Rather it is a matrix organization mixed with the traditional business 
mindset, Institutional theory, of senior and executive management keeping the business on a risk adverse and stable 
business path, which limits innovation.

5.2 Numerical Results 
Three key questions are used to answer the hypothesis. These three questions all focus on the worker’s use of 
innovation. Is innovation one of your listed job responsibilities? (Figure 2). Regardless of the previous answers, 
would you say you innovate in your day to day job (Innovation includes but not limited to product, process, ideas). 
(Figure 3). If you do innovate, does your organization encourage innovation through money, time, resource 
allocation? (Figure 4). Two of the three data sets reject the null hypothesis, proving the data is not evenly distributed 
across all survey answers for these key innovation questions. One data set shows acceptance for the null hypothesis, 
giving us the conclusion that an equal number of workers are not organizationally responsible to innovate compared 
to those that are.

The survey results also open an interesting examination of data sub-sets. The author wanted to examine 
trends based on organization type, gender and time in the industry. The chi square test for association 
above also shows limited data was used in the calculation, making the result inconclusive. If further data 
was collected, further analysis could be completed and more conclusions could be drawn about 
innovation within the Auto Industry. What we do know, from the survey results and data breakdown, the 
hypothesis is proven wrong, as the Auto Industry has an organizational structure that promotes 
innovation. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Our first conclusion will focus on the question about reporting organization. The majoring of 
respondents answered that they belong to a functional organization. The hypothesis of this paper 
states a matrix organizational structure is used throughout the Auto Industry; these results prove 
that hypothesis is incorrect, as a majority of workers belong to a functional organization The 
second conclusion shows that Auto workers in the survey do innovate, and their organizations 
either encourage or prioritize innovation in their structure. This conclusion proves the paper’s 
hypothesis incorrect, as the Automotive Industry is structured to promote innovation.

Abstract 
The technological advancements in Industry 4.0, specifically in the areas of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables a series of enhancements in production management. The development of Big 
Data, Fog & Cloud Computing and Neural Networks have made Predictive Maintenance (PdM) an area of interest as 
it has been able to effectively transform and adapt to machine conditions. This paper presents a systemic literature 
review of the state of the art in AI and IIoT regarding PdM to serve as a basis for future work in the area. The relevance 
of this subject is still high, as seen by the number of publications in the last two years, however there are still several 
relevant research challenges to be addressed, in particular to achieve an adaptable and homogeneous PdM model.

1. Introduction 
Industry 4.0 and its pillar technologies, namely, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) – 
especially, Neural Networks – are changing the original industrial automation approach (Dalzochio et al., 2020). Such 
changes in manufacturing are leveraged by the analysis of data collected through innumerous sensors distributed in 
the fabric production plants. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is among the possibilities offered by this scenario.  
  
The main idea in PdM is to anticipate failures just before they occur avoiding unscheduled machine stops and 
production halt while maximizing equipment life usage (Rieger et al., 2019). To make these predictions, real time data 
must be stored an analyzed taking into consideration different aspects and effects of the collected signals. In this 
context, AI, and, especially, Neural Networks with Deep Learning techniques and processing algorithms, have the 
capacity of turning Big Data into actual information that can be used to make decisions.  
  
  
However, with benefits also comes challenges to the implementation of these new technologies. Now industries need 
to deal with a much more dynamic environment and many of them are not ready to deal with this scenario notably 
when it comes to handle Big Data. In order to Big Data positively impacts productivity it is of paramount importance 
to choose and apply the right AI strategies. 
   
Aiming to contribute in this direction, this paper provides a systematic literature review of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and 
AI applied in PdM. Recent work covering the most recent techniques in AI on IIoT data, specifically those that produce 
predictive analysis using Neural Networks to maintenance were prioritized. The progress of the positive impact of AI

competition. An open source database from Scania with data collected from several trucks was used by Bellavista et 
al. (2020). Christou et al. (2020) used a database from the automotive industry.  
  
The works of Cakir et al. (2020), Cerquitelli et al. (2019) and Liulys (2019) used proprietary databases. Cerquitelli et 
al. (2019) gathered  the database from a robot and in Liulys (2019) used a database from Siemens DCS SIMATIC 
WinCC v6.1 by applying an open-source code called Node-RED. Cakir et al. (2020) creates a configuration to monitor 
the functionality of bearings and collects data from several IoT sensors, creating thus a local base to apply machine 
learning algorithms.  
  
Among the selected papers, the application of AI and IoT is present in the PdM analysis of the bearings of and 
induction motor (Cakir et al., 2020), in current and belt tension in a robot motor (Cerquitelli et al., 2019), in monitoring 
tension, pressure, vibration and rotation of 100 machines (Cardoso & Ferreira, 2020), in motors (Naren & Subhashini, 
2020), in cybernetic risks present in Border communication devices (Radanliev et al., 2020), in motor speed deviations 
(Liulys, 2019), in an air pressure system (Bellavista et al., 2020), and in the prediction of usable lifecycle of a drilling 
machine in the automotive industry (Christou et al., 2020).  
  
Two papers made a systematic literature review searching for state-of-the-art work using machine learning (Dalzochio 
et al., 2020) and Deep Learning (Rieger et al., 2019) applied to PdM issues. It is worth mentioning that within the 
research area of this paper, there is a need for research on strategies to simplify the use and implementation of AI and 
IoT solutions in small and medium enterprises, as they rarely have the resources and knowledge that those areas 
demands (Hansen & Bøgh, 2020). 
 
5. Conclusion 
This work aimed to perform a systematic literature review to answer the research question: How AI technologies 
enhances and allows IIoT applications in Industry 4.0, especially for PdM? It is clear by the work reviewed literature 
that AI and IIoT are enhancing the applications of PdM with solutions to fill in the gaps in Industry 4.0. Nevertheless 
there are still some answers to be found in future research, for instance, the creation of a model that can adapt to the 
ever changing production lines and personalization needs of Industry 4.0, providing better applicability and being 
more flexible to the realities in this context. 
  
PdM is seen as a challenge, but more importantly, as an opportunity in Industry 4.0. This paper discussed current 
approaches on PdM, covering architectures and AI technologies employed in this endeavor. The systematic literature 
review presented an overview of PdM using IoT applications with AI in Industry 4.0. For this end a total of 33 papers 
selected from 926 originally found about the subject creating a discussion about methods, architectures and 
technologies of AI aligned with applications used in Industry 4.0. With this work, the authors expect to contribute 
with the research community focusing on the advancement of PdM.

analysis of the literature. The results lead to the making of a portifolium of 21 articles, highlighting the more relevant 
authors, journals and keywords. The systemic analysis concluded that: the survey methodology is the most used in 
articles; while the main constructs that are directly and indirectly linked to the intention to use the service stand out. 
The results confirm that the theoretical models of technology acceptance are tools that allow the understanding of 
determinant factors reguarding the intention of usage and continuity of shared mobility. The research made possible 
to highlight that these models can explain the user's intents, ranking which constructs have greater influence, thus 
representing an important contribuition to the extension of technology intent models.

1. Introduction 
Although the concept of ""sharing"" isn't something new, the sharing of services, products and personal skills is seen as 
an essencial quality of sharing economics development, which popularity has rapidly grown over the past few years, 
being particularly successfull in digital platforms. These economic aspects have the potential to stimulate the 
distribution and usage of underutilized assets while also promoting more sustainable consumption, with economic, 
social and environmental consequences. 
The shared economy is a consumption model described as “disruptive of innovation”, which challenges the traditional 
business concept, as well as what to consume and how to consume it (Botsman e Rogers, 2011). In most cases, in this 
kind of business, consumers have the option of sharing or renting resources such as cars and rooms amongst each 
other instead of doing so through traditional companies, such as taxi companies and hotels (Satama, 2014). The sharing 
economy promotes externalities with impacts on sustainability, which means that, when sharing initiatives are well 
managed, they promote extraction, production, consumption and disposal economies (Valente; Patrus, 2019). 
Urban mobility is seen today as a great field of interest reguarding the incorporation of new technologies. With the 
continuous population growth in urban areas, cities have faced many problems in providing effective transport for the

Abstract 
This text identifies the differences and similarities on temporal and recurrent cyclicity, by the editing activity for 10 
Wikipedia Projects and the total for all 243 Wikipedia Projects, based on the monthly editorial activity from 2001 to 
2020 in: Chinese, German, English, French, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish; plus: total for 
this selected projects. This dataset was used to obtain linear regression model coefficients based on categorical lineal 
regression and Analysis Of Variance, ANOVA, to estimate coefficients by: language, year, moth of year. After this 
was used the Pearson Correlation Coefficients between linear regression model coefficients by language. We find 
differences in cyclicity, tendency for each language over this 20 years of edition

1. Introduction  
The edition of public digital humankind knowledge have at least a public data source of detailed, historical, affordable 
and available information for various regions, languages and cultures. The Wiki Stats records the Wiki Media Projects 
activity, here we use the data about 10 Wikipedia Projects edition, one by language: Chinese, German, English, French, 
Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish; plus: total for this selected projects, and all 243 Wikipedia 
Projects Total. The edition activity requires the attention of dedicated and specialized authors as difference to the 
attention of a reader. Here was used monthly edition datasets since 2001-01-01 to 2021-02-28. This dataset about 
digital, online, public, and worldwide knowledge edition activity was used to obtain linear regression model 
coefficients based on categorical lineal regression and Analysis Of Variance, ANOVA, to estimate coefficients by: 
language, year, month of year. After this was used the Pearson Correlation Coefficients between linear regression 
model coefficients by language. With this procedure we identify the coevolution for 10 Wikipedia Projects edition; it 
could be used to identify the correlation ship between these digital online activities with other activities of the society 
 
1.1 Objectives  
Identify the differences and similarities in ciclicity between 10 Wikipedia Projects edition from 2001 to 2020.

1411","6. Conclusion  
Wikipedia page editing has a similar behavior regardless of the project language on an annual basis. 
The behavior in months is similar but with lower degrees of correlation and statistical significance between languages. 
In the period 214 to 2015, the edition of pages of Wikipedia projects independently of the same and the scale of edition 
of each project decreases 
The linear regression model with categorical variables is used for each year and each month within each language, so 
the statistics are presented in both Table 10 and Table 11. From there it is identified that the models capture between 
75% and 95% of the variability total information this in the adjusted coefficient of determination. In all languages of 
the variables since they are growing time series or with pronounced cyclicality, so time series models could be 
incorporated for other purposes. On the other hand, always higher values of the Bayesian Information Criterion, SBC, 
are obtained with respect to the Aikake Information Criterion, which indicates a good fit of the proposed models. As 
they are categorical unsaturated models, a quasi-orthogonal design matrix is obtained, with which there are no 
multicollinearity effects, given the selection of the data, implying an adaptation of the estimators by ordinary least 
squares, which is the model used. Similar behaviors could occur for other electronic services or for other stages of this 
service

Abstract 
 
The following article has the purpose to estimate the effect of country and time on the attractiveness of retail. To 
achieve this, a database Global Retail Development Index from 2004 to 2019 is used. This index was made by AT 
Kearney, UK consulting firm. The final Index judges the attractiveness score for each country and each year; and the 
attractiveness position of the country are obtained. This index includes four principals: Temporary pressure, Market 
Saturation, Attractiveness, Country Risk. The index and their components punctuation change in economic, social and 
political basis. Therefore, the effect of the temporal variable over scores is identified using categorical linear regression 
models by: Country and Year. This effect over score components was estimated. It is found that from 2004 to 2019 
the variable time has decreased its explanation power and country variable has increased it.

1. Introduction 
Retail trade has been a pertinent and relevant part of the world's economic activity. This trade has been monitored 
worldwide by AT Kearney an UK Consulting firm, it identifies the attractiveness of retail markets to multiple countries 
scoring in a composite index, with open data since 2004 to 2019. The attractiveness score of the retail indices was 
obtained by 4 independent components: Time Pressure, Saturation, Attractiveness and Country Risk. From there, two 
main variables are obtained for comparison: attractiveness score and attractiveness position of the country, they are 
inverse, the lower the position, the higher the country's attractiveness score. Using linear regression models with 
categorical variables, temporal and country estimated weight was estimated to identify each National Market effect. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
Estimate the systematic effect of each country and each year in every component, score and position in the 
attractiveness of each retail store using categorical linear regression model, statistical techniques.

1422","6. Conclusion  
From the resulting coefficients of variable time (year) it is important to note that grater the year, lower the coefficient, 
that means that at the beginning of the calculation of the index the most of the measurements were not too much 
dependent of the nature of the countries, but in the last years the countries become more different and its own 
characteristics determinates their attractiveness. 
Each of the variables has a different model for each year, each country and each variable in obtaining the measurement 
of the “Global Retail Development Index”, prepared by ATKearney to obtain the attractiveness of the retail trade 
market in each territory

Abstract 
 
Here, a relationship between Colombian and USA Stock Markets was found. Also a relationship between both stock 
markets and exchange rate between Colombian Peso and USA Dollar, since 2011 to 2014. From NASDAQ Composite 
Index selected have selected 10 stocks. From Colombia stock market Index, COLCAP, used 38 stocks.  For a longer 
time the stocks will change and the relationships could do it.  In conclusion based on volatility, data scale, data 
frequency. We recommend to explore Signal Analysis Techniques to understand the auto variation, bias or effect of:

1. Introduction  
Some authors have found direct or inverse relationships between exports and imports of Colombia, their employment 
rate and the exchange rate between the local currency and the international reference currency, the US Dollar, USD. 
However, there is information that may be present or can be obtained from the stock economic instruments of both 
countries and can be associated to understand for a time their link to the exchange rate. Some financial instruments 
are taken here and this uses pearson's correlation index as an easy-to-interpret and usable statistician to identify the 
amount of information and the type of relationship between the exchange rate and the stock market activity of the two 
countries. This uses 1,097 daily log data between 2011-10-11 and 2014-10-10 for 38 COLCAP instruments and 10 
NASDAQ instruments

Identify the relationship between of selected NASDAQ, the quote on the technology stock market in the United States, 
 with the Representative Market Rate, TRM, or exchange rate between the Colombian peso, COP, and the US dollar, 
USD; officially publicized by the Colombian Government through the Bank of the Republic of Colombia. 
Also identify the relationship between the listing on the Colombian stock market, COLCAP of some instruments with 
the Representative Market Rate, TRM or exchange rate between the Colombian peso, COP, and the US dollar, 
 
2. Literature Review  
Murcia and Rojas (Murcia & Rojas, 2014) describe the dynamics of the exchange rate between the Colombian peso 
and the United States dollar from 2009 to 2013, this modeling in the short term the micro interactions of agents in a 
scenario of imperfect information and from the perspective of obtaining the best strategic positioning. It finds greater 
importance for international market factors than for local markets in defining this exchange rate.  
Li et al. (Li et al., 2018) identifies the effect of international financial and economic flows on the exchange rate with 
monthly data from 1996 to 2015, 20 years, for 53 countries including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru; 
Situation changing by the different compositions of inputs and capital of each industry, according to Casas  (Casas, 
2020); for this group the most important flow is that of the bond market. Gantman and Dabos  (Gantman & Dabós,

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
A larger set of data could be taken depending on a larger theoretical or reference framework in the literature. 
This could be proposed by annual time intervals to have an evolution in the relationship of variables.The ways to 
improve the presented text could include: signal analysis techniques to include, identification of  causality  using 
Grangers Causality statistical test,  Neural networks, to identify  que set points of the data, changes in  performance 
measurement, Cyclicity, among others. 
 
5.4 Validation  
No prior assumptions are made regarding the functional way to obtain correlation coefficients, the exercise could be 
made with monthly data since 1995 for some actions of both indices. And could be compared or expand to use Signal 
analysis procedures like : spectral power, wavelet analysis, Fourier analysis  to find  components in frequency or  
stability over the data 
 
6. Conclusion  
The representative market rate is associated with U.S. stock activity to varying degrees for different NASDAQ index 
instruments:  
Colombia's representative market rate, or COP, USD exchange rate   is associated whit the activity  in NASDAQ and 
COLCAP. 
The relationship between each pair of stocks could vary based in the inter competence in a sector. Mergers, 
acquisitions, OPA´S could change this relations. 
This study could be extended to 1980 to 2020 to include inter or intra annual effects and will use another  stock 
market index like S&P or DAX

Abstract 
 
This experience report describes the activities related to the first year of activities with the programa Satc's Creative 
Entrepreneurship Program - PEC. For the beginning of the activities, a partnership was made with the Associação 
Catarinense de Tecnologia - ACATE and with the Sapiens Institute, both based in Florianópolis / SC, for the 
structuring and implementation of the PEC. During the 18 months of the project's duration, 48 events were held, 
reaching 1,864 people registered and 1,074 effective participants. Over the months and completion of the planned 
steps, in addition to training, the practical results of the PEC were: elaboration of the fundamentals of the SATC 2030 
learning methodology, consolidation of the Applied Technologies curriculum component for basic education, start of 
the innovation ecosystem activities (pre-incubator Cocreation Lab Satc and incubator Colearning), incorporation of 
the discipline of Creativity and Innovation and the replacement of the TCC - Course Completion work by ECC - End 
of course development in the new matrices of undergraduate courses, in addition to other initiatives.

1. Introduction  
 
In its more than 60 years of history in the region, Satc has always had education and technology as its foundation. 
From 2018, the institution that has already trained thousands of students in the most varied areas of knowledge, 
advances and starts to include in its mission the culture of innovating. To this end, Satc 2030 appears, a Platform that 
has as its pillar Creative Entrepreneurship and Innovation as the essence of the pillars of a change aimed at the next 
decade and the future of the school. 
 
The Satc 2030 Platform brings together an institutional action plan aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) proposed by the United Nations (UN). This platform applies innovative concepts in education, management 
and development of physical and intellectual assets that SATC has. The search for the culture of entrepreneurship, 
technological innovation, the creation of national and international partners, in the investment in the culture of research 
and development applied to business needs and their insertion in the sustainability agenda, are points of relevance in 
the journey of the future of SATC (Castelan at al. 2019). 
 
SATC's new leap in its reinvention trajectory, characteristic of actions on the path of success until the age of 60, is 
based on the component of the family spirit, the commitment to unite everyone, the love for an institution that honors 
its employees. Ethics in relationships, the commitment to the well done, the results obtained, the successes of this 
journey leave all those who were at the head of SATC, with great pride and with the desire that in the next 60 years, 
the Institution can make a difference in the development of our Society and region. 
 
In this report, we are going to present the Creative Entrepreneurship Program - PEC, which is a program developed 
in partnership with ACATE - Associação Catarinense de Tecnologia that aims to foster an entrepreneurial culture with 
a creative bias in all those involved in education: managers, coordinators, teachers, employees in general, students and 
the external community. The program takes place in a series of workshops held at SATC and address themes related

1445","from an idea, the Course Conclusion Enterprise - ECC. ECC is a business model that is developed in Satc's pre-
incubator - the Cocreation Lab. The new course matrices, therefore, will present the PFC - Final Course Project, 
instead of the TCC. Enrolling in the PFC, the student has two options - TCC or ECC. 
 
6. Conclusion   
 
we innovate because we prioritize quality education for the citizens and professionals we train. PEC is yet another 
initiative to connect students, the internal and external communities and the region's innovation ecosystem to the 
future. Encourage the development of soft skills, such as leadership, and promote the search for new solutions for the 
market. 
 
Since it was implemented, the PEC has made it possible to implement new institutional projects such as the Cocreation 
Lab, Colearning and HUB Satc. In addition, it has been an important training and networking tool for startups. The 
project followed three pillars: the awakening of new ideas, the attraction of these businesses and the consolidation. 
 
Everyone involved in the consolidation of the PEC believes that entrepreneurial education is of paramount importance 
for the future of the actors we impact (students, employees, incubators, the external community, the local innovation 
ecosystem, among others). To exemplify the quality of the work that Satc has been doing, the words of the coordinator 
of ACATE Educação Felipe Mandawalli finalize this report. 
 
“Satc's evolution since the beginning of the program is visible. We even see changes in the structure of the courses, 
where there will be the possibility of creating a startup during the TCC, as well as high school / technical students 
doing jobs with real market problems”.

Abstract 
Portfolio Management is a technique to manage several individual projects with similar goals at the same time. Social 
projects with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are very common, however NGOs do not normally possess 
the knowledge or the manpower to take in new projects. When social projects are undertaken, the management of 
scarce resources and knowledge is fundamental to achieve each individual project goal. Through a literature review 
and search for the best selection method to incorporate projects in the portfolio this work will demonstrate a case study 
performed by a scholarship student of IFSP in the selection, execution and control & monitor phases of a portfolio 
that was undertaken in the 2020 school year. The work was able to answer the research questions and improve overall 
individual project performance, increasing the institutions body of knowledge and lessons learned, even in a year with 
many uncertainties due to the COVID-19 restrictions.

1. Introduction 
With the transformation and changes in the world caused by technological advancement and the need to increase the 
manor in which project management is seen, new strategies, technics and tools for project management are required 
to increase visibility and results in organizations. This research is motivated by the increase in knowledge in managing 
a portfolio of Social Projects that are undertaken as a part of the mandatory subject of “Integrated Project” in the 
second year of Electronics Technical Course. 
 
There are several different methodologies for portfolio management, such as Canvas (Neto, 2016), with the 
programming of criteria to properly select and categorize the various individual projects. Since the “Integrated Project” 
subject of IFSP utilizes the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) as the managing tool for the 
individual projects, the Portfolio management will follow the instructions and methodology of the PMBOK.(PMI, 
2018) 
 
This paper will be divided into five chapters: what is portfolio management based on a literature review; important 
and relevant definitions; the criteria for selecting the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) projects to fit in the 
portfolio; execution and monitoring/control phases and a conclusion. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The main objective of this paper is to enable and help managers in Portfolio Management of Social Projects. To 
perform such task the following research questions should be answered: 
 
What are the best methods in choosing projects to fit in a portfolio? 
 
How can Portfolio Management increase the success rate of the individual projects?

1456","The lessons learned with the 5 projects that were accepted will help to better select proposals in 2021 academic year 
as this project will continue with new NGO´s and new proposals. Amongst them we quote: i) better engagement from 
the NGOs; ii) at least a monthly conference call with all stakeholders to assess project perception; iii) improvement 
of the criteria and selection process of proposals; iv) standardize reports for all projects to better keep track of 
performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Portfolio management is a complex task to be undertaken, with several problems affecting the success of the projects. 
To achieve success the project management plan must be aligned with realistic achievements and goals. Also, the 
metrics between what was proposed and what was delivered is important to remove speculative results. To achieve 
this the actions were taken to comply with the project plan, always searching for fast solutions for the issues that arose 
keeping stakeholder´s engagement in the process. 
 
When referring to the research question “What are the best methods in choosing projects to fit in a portfolio?” Section 
3 was able to properly respond that inquiry. The other research question “How can Portfolio Management increase 
the success rate of the individual projects?” was detailed Section 2 with the literature review. Finally, the case study 
displayed in Section 4 made a practical use of the theory in which it was possible to implement knowledge developed 
in this paper, thus allowing the Portfolio Manager and the individual projects to have a better perception of the 
complete Project Management process. 
 
Working with NGOs of different sizes and managing their expectations was the most challenging aspect of the task 
undertaken. Due to the level of knowledge by both students and NGOs communications and reports need to be 
improved for the next instances of the Portfolio Management project to ensure even better results.

Abstract 
This paper presents a model that identifies those variables that significantly affect the general performance of a 
warehouse with picker-to-parts storage systems, considering the dynamic nature of its processes and the 
possible non-linear relationships between its variables, under the effect of products with seasonal demand and 
long and short life cycles at the same time. As a methodology, a simulation model was developed under the 
systems dynamics (SD) paradigm. The main conclusions are that with this type of model it is possible to explain 
the behavior of the very structure of the warehouse and explain some non-linear relationships between its 
variables, such as the percentage of receipt on pallets, the percentage of picking and the total operating cost. 
The total operating cost is significantly affected when the percentage of receipt in full pallets decreases or when 
the percentage of picking increases. In relation to the percentage of income from full pallets, the imbalance 
between the receiving capacity in full and non-full pallets, generating accumulation of product to receive and 
penalization in costs due to delays in unloading (stand by) as the strategy upon receipt, full pallets decrease its 
percentage. The same happens with the picking percentage, as it increases, the increase in the total operating 
cost increases exponentially, because the pallets to be sent to customers cannot be processed on time, because 
there is also an imbalance between the capacity to prepare full and non -complete pallet orders.

1. Introduction  
 
Within the supply chain (SC) one of the most important node is the warehouse (Kusrini, Novendri, & Helia, 
2018),  which is a fundamental part of the development of logistics activities (Staudt, Alpan, Di Mascolo, & 
Rodriguez, 2015). Additionally, its operating cost is between 22 and 24% of the total logistics costs (Baker & 
Canessa, 2009; Havenga, Simpson, De Bod, & Viljoen, 2014). According to the   National Logistics Survey 
(2018), the average logistics cost as a percentage of sales of companies in Colombia represents 13.5%, with the 
costs associated with warehouses being the most representative (46.5% out of 13.5%). However, although more 
than 80% of all order picking systems in Western Europe are picker to parts, the academic literature focuses 
primarily on warehouses with automated storage systems (product-to-picker) and automated storage/retrieval 
system (AS/RS - no utilization of personnel) (van Gils, Ramaekers, Caris, & de Koster, 2018). In Colombia, 
for example, to date, there is only one warehouse with an AS/RS. 
The processes of a warehouse can be decomposed into several processes: receipt, storage, order picking and 
shipping. However, academic literature has mainly focused on the second and third processes (van Gils et al., 
2018). All processes are conditioned by internal or external variables that affect their performance (de Koster, 
Le-Duc, & Roodbergen, 2007). Underestimating or ignoring them can lead to the failure of the warehouse 
operation, which demands a more precise knowledge on how to identify and understand the impact of these 
variables on the performance of this nodes of the SC (Razik, Radi, & Okar, 2016).

1465","5. Conclusion 
 
In this work we present a system dynamics model of a warehouse with picker-to-parts system that represent a 
major portion of warehouse operations in practice. Using this model, we identified that among the variables 
that are part of such type of warehouse there are always not necessarily linear relationships, this is the case 
between the percentage of product that enters the warehouse on full pallets, the percentage of picking and the 
total operating cost.  
 
The reasons are associated with the imbalance between the receiving capacity in full and non-full pallets, the 
first being 7.6 times greater, generating accumulation of product to receive and penalization in costs due to 
delays in unloading (stand by) as the strategy upon receipt full pallets decrease its percentage. The same happens 
with the picking percentage, as it increases, the increase in the total operating cost increases exponentially, 
because the pallets to be sent to customers cannot be processed on time, using a greater number of hours to 
make the same job due to delay; considering that, the imbalance between the capacity to prepare full and non-
full pallet orders also influences, with their ratio being 2.9 times. 
 
Future work will analyze the relationship between the total cost of operation and other variables, such as the 
capacity of the reception area, the capacity of the area of preparation of orders or storage and the inclusion of 
the availability of vehicles and delays in their arrivals, as well such as staff turnover between processes and its 
effect on performance.  
 
For example, the lack of availability of vehicles or the delay in their arrival could increase the level of inventory 
since it would affect the continuous output of product and could increase the total operating cost, considering 
that more man-hours would be needed to make the same work. Also, if operating personnel are trained to do 
various tasks within the warehouse, the total operating cost could decrease because personnel could move 
between processes to level product flows.

Abstract 
 
In the traditional linear economy, the consumption of products is given by taking, manufacturing and discarding, this 
has brought with it adverse consequences in the environment and the economy, due to the scarcity of natural resources 
given its finite condition, generation of emissions to the environment and tons of waste generated that have saturated 
the management capacity in landfills. Therefore, it is necessary to migrate towards a Circular Economy (CE) to 
preserve natural resources, extending the useful life of products, increasing their durability with remanufacturing, 
repair, recycling and reuse cycles. In Colombia have been developing different initiatives that follow, with some lag, 
in trends in European and Asian countries, where different sectors have intervened such as electrical and electronic 
equipment, plastic packaging, batteries, drugs and tires. The furniture sector has been identified as a priority for an 
adaptation towards CE requires efficient use of the furniture, to reduce emissions in production and the volume of 
waste generated. 
 
One of the EC implementation strategies is Product as a Service (PSS). It is a combination of tangible products and 
intangible services to satisfy the needs demanded by customers, according to its orientation it allows to apply 
sustainability criteria having a transition from product to service. From this strategy, it is possible to improve the 
design of the furniture for its subsequent recycling and extend the useful life with the implementation of additional 
services such as maintenance and repair, reuse of parts or remanufacturing of used furniture. In this work, a 
methodology is developed to configure the PSS strategy in the furniture sector, specifically in Higher Education 
Institutions (IES) focused on chairs for the provision of classrooms, with the aim of opening the possibility of changes 
in consumption patterns, use and final disposal, where through a new PSS supply model, a positive environmental and 
economic impact is achieved. As a result of a diagnostic phase, review of state of the art and case studies, the a 
configuration define proposed 16 factor and elements critical, product features and service features, which according 
the level of orientation of PSS and the actors involved in the supply strategy, it is proposed a form combine them to 
satisfy the need for the implementation and transition to a PSS supply model.  
 
This configuration is validated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts, which allows to have the client vision generated 
by the acquisition of the product and the sustainability implied by the acquisitions with EC criteria. Finally, a 
procedure is proposed to measure the performance of the proposed PSS strategy, the application of a case study at the 
University of Antioquia, which shows its convenience, by simulating the current furniture management system and 
the proposed PSS strategy. Of this is expected to demonstrate the PSS as acquisition model that can aument 
competitiveness, profits of an organization and meet the needs of customers, creating less environmental impact than 
traditional business models of selling products.

Abstract 
 
Privacy and security concerns with Big Data have gained momentum in both research and business fields. 
Organizations in general have long recognized the need of data analytics to increase quality and provide better value 
for financial statements users. Audit firms, in particular, have made significant investments in the field of data 
analytics, as traditional auditing techniques have not kept pace with the evolving economy and large investments of 
organizations in data and technology. Audit data analytics have become an increasingly important tool for auditors to 
increase the quality and performance of their audit. However, such implementation have raised the concerns for 
privacy and security of client data. The main objective of this paper is to provide a context to organizations by 
highlighting on the security and privacy concerns triggered by big data analytics and the importance of this matter in 
the audit sector. To this end, using an in-depth literature review, and drawing on a sound theoretical framework 
comprising utility maximization theory and procedural fairness theory, the paper proposes a conceptual model that 
depicts the relationships between privacy and security concerns, data analytics and audit quality. The model 
implications are discussed, and recommendations for future research are presented.

1. Introduction  
“With great power of data comes great responsibility”, (Singh, 2014). The field of big data analytics has witnessed 
increasing interest in both scientific and business fields for the tremendous value it has offered. In the business world, 
the real power of data resides in the value of insights organizations are able to gather for future opportunities and 
prosper. The term “Big data” refers to massive and complicated datasets, which are difficult to store, visualize and 
analyze with typical software (Terzi et al., 2015). According to the Mckinsey Global Institute, data volume was 
expected to grow 40% annually between 2009 and 2020 (Singh, 2014). With the emerging data analytics technologies, 
companies are capable of coping with such difficulties.  
Audit firms in particular, have long recognized the need of data analytics to increase quality and provide better value 
for financial statements users. Traditional auditing has not kept pace with the changing economy and the large 
investments of organizations in data and technology. In 1989, Groomer and Murthy first discussed the concept of 
“Continuous Auditing” that aims to automate the auditing process to provide maximum assurance (Jans & 
Hosseinpour, 2018). With the help of data analytics, many auditors are finding ways to gain a deeper understanding 
of their clients’ businesses than ever. They are able to establish better insights that help in assessing risks, detecting 
fraud, and performing substantive audit procedures. 
Despite the appealing elements of big data analytics, being regarded as the engine of the economic growth, new 
privacy and security concerns are developed. Besides the vast benefits of data analytics in different sectors such as 
Marketing, Finance and Accounting, its widespread usage has pointed various questions regarding the integrity, 
confidentiality and monitoring of big data analyzed (Joshi & Kadhiwala, 2017). Numerous academic research is being 
conducted on the opportunities and challenges within the application of data analytics in businesses stating that privacy

Abstract 
 
Safety at work is very important to every industry and minimizing the risk of workplace accidents and injuries is of 
utmost importance in the discussion of occupational, health and safety (OSH). Increasing density of manufacturing 
companies as locators in a high-growth export processing zone in Laguna Philippines led to the conduct of this study 
aimed at analyzing the causes of accidents and assessing the risk factors and OSH practices with the end in view of 
determining a better approach in OSH management. Actual cases and accounts of occupational accidents, their causes, 
and resulting injuries were gathered via interviews and survey questionnaires. An assessment was made on the OSH 
programs, the work environment and organizational factors. The results of the study pointed to the importance of 
integrating risk management in performing OSH management as non-identification of hazards was found to be a major 
cause of workplace accidents and injuries. As such, an improved OSH management model was developed with the 
integration of risk management centered on collaboration among process owners in putting in place a proactive, 
ongoing process to identify and assess high-priority risks and hazards, the critical element of any effective safety and 
health program.

1. Introduction 
 
In the past years, occupational accidents in major and minor industries in the Philippines are always critical. The 
Philippine government has made efforts to execute safety and health policies through the enforcement of guidelines 
and conduct site safety seminars and certifications. The government has instituted laws and regulations for the 
protection of industrial workers. For example, the Philippine Constitution included provisions on the protection and 
promotion of the workers' welfare.  The Philippines' Labor Code also provides for workers' safety and health to 
promulgate the Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Business and Industry.  Nowadays, numerous training, 
seminars, programs, and practices are promoted by different agencies in the Philippines (government and private) to 
prevent occupational accidents.  Based on the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics records in the year 2013, 
there are 34,579 establishments in the Philippines applying occupational health and safety-related programs and 
policies. On the other hand, 25,857 establishments availed the OSH related training and seminars, while 34,579 
establishments have preventive control activities regarding occupational accident prevention. 
 
Even with these existing programs and practices to prevent occupational accidents, cases of occupational accidents 
and injuries in the Philippines are still increasing.  Rhamani et al. (2013) also stated that despite implementing safety 
strategies in workplaces, occupational accidents and incidents have increased in parallel to developing industries.  
Records from the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics (BLES) in figure 1 show that in 2011 total occupational 
accidents in the Philippines increased to 20,846 cases from 17,601 in the year 2009.

1499","4. Conclusion 
 
Different agencies promote numerous training, seminars, programs, and practices in the Philippines to prevent 
occupational accidents.  However, with these existing programs and practices to prevent occupational accidents, cases 
of occupational accidents and injuries in the Philippines are still increasing. Also, despite the safety strategies in the 
workplaces, occupational accidents and incidents have been increasing.   
 
This study identified the significant factors or causes of accidents affecting the occupational accidents in the Philippine 
heavy manufacturing industry through the statistical analysis.  The factors that significantly contribute are exposure 
to hazardous work environments followed by unsafe working conditions and unsafe acts like not using the provided 
PPEs. This result shows that despite the existing safety programs and practices being applied today, the risks of 
occupational accidents in the heavy manufacturing industry are high. The safety programs and practices being 
implemented are not enough to prevent occupational accidents in the Philippine manufacturing industry. In line with 
this, the author of the study finds that performing management of risks of occupational accidents is a great help in 
reducing occupational accidents.  Risk management and safety management are both critical in preventing 
occupational accidents. 
 
Occupational accident in the Philippine manufacturing industry was in level which still can be prevented. Therefore, 
most common occupational accidents and factors should be prevented with the cooperation of Occupational Safety 
and Health programs and Risk Management. To reduce occupational accidents in the Philippine heavy manufacturing 
industries, integration of Risk Management strategies in the planning stage of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Programs where hazards and risks of accidents are assessed will significantly help.  Risk Management is to continually 
allow us to identify and assess work hazards, implement controls to remove or reduce the risk to the lowest possible 
level and review these hazards to ensure they are maintained at the lowest reasonable risk.  The risk management 
process will consistently identify hazards by applying the process to all of the activities.  Risk assessments should be 
undertaken if one of the following events occurs:  
 
1. Before setting up and using any new premises as a place of work. 
2. When planning/designing work processes. 
3. Before installation, erection, commissioning, or alteration of the plant. 
4. Whenever changes are made to the workplace and the system or work process  
5. Before hazardous substances are introduced into a place of work or process. 
6. When new or additional health and safety information relevant to our business becomes available. 
 
 
5. Recommendation 
 
Occupational safety and health programs, training, and safety practices applied by the Philippines' heavy 
manufacturing industries nowadays are identified in this study.  Accident prevention begins with a clear understanding 
of factors that play vital roles in their causation; the study identified the significant factors of accidents affecting 
occupational accidents and the association of the factors of accidents with the resulting accidents and injuries.  
Estimated risks of the factors of accidents, their resulting accidents, and injuries were also identified in this study.  
Further study can be conducted to determine the causes or factors contributing to the identified significant occupational 
accidents and their resulting accident and injuries.   
 
The study focused on the cases of non-fatal occupational accidents gathered from the heavy manufacturing industries 
in the Philippines.  Future researchers may perform a study that will cover occupational accidents from the small and 
medium manufacturing industries, including fatal accidents and near-miss accidents in the study.

Abstract 
 
Poor ergonomics leads to frustrated and fatigued workers that may not perform their job like they were trained which 
could create a product quality issue. In workstations for visual inspections, operators can have visual fatigue due to 
excessive usage of devices with light emissions, glare from inspection or poor lighting and too many components to 
check within a very short period. Similar conditions exist in a leading manufacturer of aircraft parts for the commercial 
and business jet aircraft markets. Visual quality of parts is what works in an aircraft interior that showcases comfort, 
safety and even luxury, the sensual benefits conveyed to passengers. Providing standard operating procedures and 
reference target specifications will not be enough to ensure consistency and reliability of visual inspection results 
without first identifying the ergonomic risk factors in a visual inspection workstation. Accordingly, with the heavy 
use of the faculty of eyesight and other faculties of cognition to assess visual quality performance of aircraft parts 
products, this  study aims to assess the importance of  incorporating cognitive ergonomics in the design of work 
conditions and environments that enhance cognitive functioning at work, and as a consequence, improve worker 
productivity and product quality.

1. Introduction  
 
The aerospace industry is one of the largest and most influential industries worldwide, which supplies five markets 
such as military aircraft, missiles, space, commercial airliners, and general aviation. The aerospace industry's product 
line is, by necessity, broad because its primary products, flight vehicles, require up to millions of individual parts. In 
addition, many support systems are needed to operate and maintain the vehicles. Many parts are needed before an 
aircraft is assembled, divided into three categories based on previous research.  
 
The subject company is a manufacturer of aircraft passenger cabin interior products for the commercial and business 
jet aircraft markets. The company had a leading worldwide market share in all of its primary product lines. It served 
all of the world's airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and leasing companies virtually through its direct global sales and 
customer support organizations.  
 
Since it began the production and management system used by the manufacturer of aircraft parts is JIT System and 
have been established to improve the competitiveness on the market. The company is the parts supplier specifically 
for aircraft industries.  
 
However, the company of interest has been experiencing a not-so-good trend in customer complaints related to visual 
defects for the past one-and-a-half years. According to data, 69% in 2015 to almost 86% in January-May 2016 may 
require serious attention to look into how its workplace design contributes to a paramount concern on visual inspection, 
which is deemed the last gate before shipping out parts products airline companies worldwide. The earlier mention of 
the research gap on the topic of interest and the preceding discussion of the situation of a company engaged in the

1511","4. Conclusion 
 
Upon analyzing the results from the survey, the researcher concluded that the workplace on the visual inspection area 
has ergonomic medium risk in the visual inspection process and needs intervention to prevent long term effect on the 
inspector’s health.  
                 
After a data analysis of the researcher using SPSS for the productivity, it can be said that it is inconclusive since there 
is no relationship among the variables treated as dependent variables. In contrast, it was determined that the significant 
factor’s that affects the quality of the output using SPSS are: visual inspection of the unit, use of computer, workplace 
design, ergonomics in the workplace, and the presence of pain. 
 
After the assessment made by the researcher on the visual inspection area, it was proven that improvement of the 
situation in the workplace design with the incorporation of cognitive ergonomics with the physical workplace design 
factors should be made. The following are the recommended improvement; provide light/lamp in the visual inspection 
area to improve the lighting condition, relocate the position of the computer to minimize the risk on the inspector’s 
health, embed the actual pictures of the unit in work instruction to serve as information display that will guide and 
support the inspector. It is also recommended to provide a shadow board for a tool that will be used in visual inspection 
to improve the recognition of defects. 
 
 
5. Recommendation 
 
It is also recommended that the parts aircraft manufacturer recognize the benefits of cognitive ergonomics in the 
visual inspection area. The support of top management in improving the workplace through cognitive ergonomics 
will improve visual inspection quality, thus decreasing customer complaints regarding visual defects. 
 
Based on the study's preceding findings, further studies of productivity analysis should use different approaches and 
tools assessment. As a result of ANOVA, it is inconclusive for the productivity analysis since there is no 
relationship seen among the variables treated as dependent variables. There are still variables that fit the dependent 
variable that may lead to a conclusion.

Abstract 
 
Road accidents is one of the highest causes of morbidity and fatality in the Philippines. The number of vehicular 
accidents has been on a rising trend, doubled from 63,072 incidents in 2007 to 116,906 in 2018. According to the 
latest WHO data published in 2018, Road Traffic Accident Deaths in Philippines reached 10,624 which accounted for 
1.74% of total deaths in the country. The age adjusted Death Rate is 11.40 per 100,000 of population ranks Philippines 
#118 in the world. Road traffic accidents was the 14th leading cause of death in the Philippines in life expectancy but 
ranks second in non-disease-caused deaths next to assault. In Metro Manila or the National Capital Region, 
approximately 7,000 Filipinos die every year, and thousands are disabled because of road traffic accidents. This study 
was conducted primarily to assess the factors that affect road traffic accidents and determine the significant 
relationships between causal factors and accidents and propose corresponding strategies to reduce risks of road traffic 
accidents and minimize fatal and non-fatal injuries therefrom.

1. Introduction 
 
Accidents happen due to the combination of several factors and are often not caused by a single cause. Risk increasing 
factors is more appropriate to explain why accidents occur (Third African road safety congress, 1997). According to 
Angelica Batrakova (2015), road safety can be understood as the result of the safe interaction of participants of traffic 
themselves and the environment. It is well-established that driving under the influence of alcohol increases the risk of 
accident involvement (Borkenstein et al., 1964). Safety is a significant concern of transportation planners and 
engineers in their transportation infrastructure design and its use (Button, K., 2014). Another critical issue concern is 
the impact of economic conditions and their change on traffic safety performance (Bougueroua & Carnis, 2016). 
 
In the Philippines, which has approximately 103 million population, motor vehicle traffic is predominant in major 
islands due to its archipelagic nature, significant cities, and economic activities (Villoria, O. & Diaz, C., 2000). Metro 
Manila's population density swelled from 9,317 persons/sq. km in 1980 to 19,297 person/sq. km in 2012. Over the 
same period, its share of Philippine GDP increased from 30.1% to 36.2%. Meanwhile, total registered vehicles rose 
from 446,142 to 1,904,305 as privately-owned vehicles (not-for-hire) increased from 391,178 to 1,717,453 (Yujuico, 
E., 2014). 
 
Road traffic accidents (RTAs) in the Philippines reached 1.87% of total deaths (WHO, 2014), the second leading cause 
of injury death next to assault. In Metro Manila, the current population is roughly 12 million as of 2015. Approximately 
7,000 Filipinos die every year, and thousands are disabled because of road traffic accidents (WPRO, 2017). In the 
Philippines, RTAs have been a significant concern within Metro Manila, with the cities of Quezon, Makati, and Manila 
having the highest rates in road accidents in that order. These cities are considered as central business districts given 
that they are the most socially and economically developed. Traffic in these areas is regarded as bumper to bumper, 
particularly in significant routes like EDSA, Commonwealth Ave., Quezon Ave., and Roxas Boulevard.

1521","4.3 Black Point System 
 
The black point system is a fined wherein the drivers are involved in a road accident or involved in impaired driving, 
a certain number of black points will be issued against the driver's license. Black points are issued together with the 
regular driver's license. The land transportation office will handle the system. Once the driver has an offense, MMDA 
will have data and input them to their active website (www.mayhuliba.com), wherein the drivers can check if they 
have any violations. The validity of black points lasts for one calendar year and gets canceled at the end of it. In other 
words, the black points accumulated in the previous year will disappear after 12 months and get to start with a clean 
driving license. If the total number of black points exceeds 24 points, drivers may be banned from driving any vehicle 
for a year. Similarly, black points are charged for parking fines, driving recklessly, speeding, non-renewal vehicle

5. Conclusion 
 
Based on the hypothesis testing, there is a significant relationship between the road character and vehicle's type, 
driver's gender has a significant relationship to the type of the vehicle; therefore, the hypothesis testing for the 
relationship of the vehicle factor and user demographic is accepted. The use of regression to the factors was found to 
have a clear influential factor in road traffic accidents.  The factors found significant are the driver's age, gender, 
vehicle age, road character, road lane character, traffic condition, type of vehicles, driving experience, and time of 
accidents – these are the main factors that influence road traffic accidents. 
 
The study shows that when there is a change in a subfactor, it can also affect the other subfactors contributing to road 
traffic accidents. Take a scenario when a female driver has a longer driving experience than a male driver; still, they 
can contribute to the same on the road traffic accident occurring along roadways. There is a need for government to 
address a more fundamental problem of inadequate and inaccurate traffic accident data. Without establishing an 
effective accident report system, it would be difficult not only to monitor the level of road traffic safety but also to 
formulate and implement cost-effective road safety programs. With the rapidly increasing vehicle number, the need 
for attention to improving road safety is a prime concern. 
 
Mitigating measures should be taken to eliminate road traffic accidents that are occurring in the City of Makati. The 
results demonstrate the relationship between road traffic accidents, gender, age, infrastructure, and vehicle factor. In 
particular, the driver's age, gender, vehicle age, road character, road lane character, traffic condition, type of vehicles, 
driving experience, and time of accidents confirm the importance of factors to investigate to lessen road traffic 
accidents in Makati. The identification of these factors leads to the establishment of specific preventive measures that 
aimed to minimize accidents. The implementation of the new driver license systems together with the black point 
system would help lessen the road traffic accident. Finally, the need to improve the systematic recording of accident 
data has been identified. Improving the road traffic accident reports forms can also reduce road traffic accidents. This 
data is based on the vehicles involved in the accident and can help distinguish if what factor should be updated. 
However, some relationships between accidents related variables such as the road signs, traffic lights, and 
unfamiliarity remain unexplained. This contribution should be verified in further studies.

Abstract 
 
As the longevity and population of older persons increase in many nations, a central question is whether this population 
aging will be accompanied by sustained or improved health, an improving quality of life, and sufficient social and 
economic resources. As such, this study aimed at determining an elderly care system that will bridge the gap between 
the rising needs of the Filipino elderly and the current systems and practices in the delivery of services to the aging 
population at the basic level – the family and at the institutional level – with local and national government agencies. 
The study developed a susceptibility index with indicator levels that would correspond to varying categories of elderly 
care needs determined by universal care policies, family demographics, health risks, and environments of specific 
target populations, the significance of the factors of which were statistically established from interview and survey 
results gathered from a representative metropolitan city. Additionally, the study included the bases for the development 
of a system application in the formulation of effective policies aimed at enhancing the health status, as well as the 
social and economic well-being, of elderly Filipinos. This model can be emulated at the provincial and regional levels 
in the country.

1. Introduction 
 
As the world's life expectancy is steadily increasing, so is the aging population, which means every country is 
experiencing growth in its population's older class (United Nations WPA, 2015). This development of the aging 
population directly impacts family caregivers' availability and the level of satisfaction of the elders' basic needs. (Tao 
& McRoy, 2015) The impact poses a challenge to the Philippine health care providers' ability to make sure that aging 
becomes a good experience overall for elders and that institutions that provide elderly care have an efficient structure. 
The pressing need for an inventive system to aid the elderly cope with their respective daily existences is raised 
because of this. (Wang & Sun, 2015) 
 
In the Philippines, the elderly are being attended by their families more due to their constitution to care for its elderly 
members. However, the State may also do so through just programs of social security. In a study by Domingo & 
Casterline (1992), about 70% were found to co-reside with their immediate family. The addressing of the necessities 
of elders affects their condition of life. For the elders, the quality of life can be described as aging in place, which 
means seniors may remain to live in the community without the need to move away or be sent to residential care. 
(Davey, de Joux, Genesh & Arcus 2004). Successful aging is defined as the satisfaction of three factors: the minimal 
likelihood of illness and disability due to diseases, elevated intellectual capacity for physical functions, and dynamic 
engagement with life, as Kahn and Rowe (1997) stated. For this principle to be successfully met, accessibility to 
services and sites and connection to the living environment must be considered (Granbom, Iwarsson, Kylberg, 
Petterson, & Slaug, 2016). 
 
Caring for the elderly involves the following: (1) self-care; (2) non-professional caregivers; (3) families; (4) home 
care aides; (5) professional caregivers; and (6) social workers. (Tao & McRoy, 2015) Hence, the responsibility of 
elderly quality living rests not only in the elders' hands but also on the family members and care networks.  In these

Abstract  
 
Rice production is an important aspect of the Philippine food supply and economy. Mechanized farming has received 
extensive government support with farm equipment and training on the basics of operations, repairs and maintenance 
through local cooperatives tasked with its future replacement. Thus, it would be imperative to systematize maintenance 
practices to ensure proper upkeep and operations. Extant literature highlighted benefits of total productive 
maintenance (TPM) in manufacturing environments but not in the agricultural sector, particularly in rice production. 
This research was aimed to institutionalize TPM practices at the local level by showing its benefits in terms of the 
better equipment utilization, and improvement in yield. The study chose for its research locale the province of 
Occidental Mindoro, an agricultural area devoted for rice production, which is a source of employment of almost 80% 
of its population. After an assessment of maintenance practices, areas of improvement were incorporated in a TPM 
strategy model grounded at the local level, not as complex as in a manufacturing setup, but a straightforward approach 
of equipping the farm cooperative personnel with a TPM mind set in view of the benefits of longer equipment lives 
and improved reliability that will consequently maximize crop yield and profitability.

1. Introduction 
 
In the passage towards a world's class food provider, several sectors realize the necessity to maintain equipment and 
machines. Because of the high market demand, these sectors were pressed to adopt new technologies with no options 
for failures and wastes (Mwanza et al., 2015). These drastic changes in technology worldwide have carried many 
modifications in machine and equipment applicable in different sectors. The agricultural sector, for example, is 
becoming more technologically advanced too. Because of these changes, machine and equipment maintenance 
necessities have also altered and became more advanced. 
 
Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy of the Philippines. The Philippine economy posted a 6.0% growth in 
2018, with Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry, and Fishing (AHFF) contributing 7.4%. Although the Philippines is a minor 
exporter of different agriculture products, it remains significant since it is the country's 37% workforce. The 
government is also focused on attaining long-term food production, and supply sustainability with its fast-growing 
population has increased to approximately 100.98 million in 2016 (PSA, 2016). 
 
The Philippine agricultural sector has four sectors, namely: livestock, forestry fisheries, and farming. In the farming 
industry, the country's main crops are sugarcane, coconut, coffee, mangoes, rice, corn, bananas, pineapple, mangoes, 
tobacco, and abaca. Rice is the major crop in the Philippines and is planted in about 30% of the country's total area 
harvest (David Dawe, 2005). Mendoza (2008) stated that rice farming practices in the Philippines involve the 
following: seedling preparation, spacing, and row, weed and irrigation management, harvesting, spreading and 
incorporating straw manually, but this has changed. In the Philippines, rice production has been continually shifting 
because of technological development, and the government proposed agendas with the people's active trials and need. 
A tremendous demand of these requirements is the unceasing growing population that has to be served and the cost

4. Conclusion 
 
The first objective of the paper was to evaluate the maintenance practices of the mechanized rice production and it 
was obtained through interview, observation and conducted survey. The researcher concluded that the performance of 
the machine and equipment in terms of availability, durability, functionality, quality, reliability and safety are below 
the overall equipment effectiveness percentage which is 80%, the rice production players were all dissatisfied in the 
performance and gave a rating of below 40%. Also, the results manifested that the maintenance cost per month which 
consisted mainly of replacement of parts, change oil and breakdown repair costs roughly 1001-3000 pesos per month 
which contributed with the total operational cost of 20,001-30,000 pesos per cropping which is very high as compared 
to the average operating cost of 19,000 pesos per cropping as per Department of Agriculture (2019). This high cost 
was resulted because of no maintenance and that the agricultural players experienced frequent breakdown of 11-20 
hours machine per month. 
 
The research’s objective number 2 of this research was to determine the significant factors affecting the decisions 
related to the mechanization and maintenance practices of rice production players in the Philippines. This objective 
was achieved through conducting survey to rice production players and statistical analyses. Significant factors were 
identified by using Factor Analysis and Regression Analysis. Based on the results, the significant factors are: land 
areas of farm, number of machineries and equipment, involvement in rice production players and the years in the field 
of rice production.  
 
The last objective was to formulate a TPM-based strategy and model in employing best practices in the maintenance 
of machines & equipment in the rice production sector towards better productivity and cost efficiency. It was attained 
by using statistical analysis such as the test of normality, factor analysis, linear regression and multiple regression. 
The framework developed on this research paper was suited to the needs of the rice production players in a TPM based 
framework.  
 
The research question for this research is if Total Productive Maintenance can be adopted in Philippine rice production 
to address local issues of high operations and maintenance costs in view of the country’s thrust for food sustainability 
and affordability was answered by obtaining the three objectives of this research. Based on the results and discussions, 
this TPM based framework will work effectively in rice production sector. 
 
 
5. Recommendation 
 
This research study recommends the adoption of the TPM based framework to the rice production sector in the 
Philippines in order to address the local issues of high operations and maintenance costs in view of the country’s thrust 
for food sustainability and affordability. Significant effects will be the reduced breakdown cost, maintenance cost and 
operational cost. With lower operational cost, there will also be a reduction in the price of rice, thus the rice will 
become affordable to all the Filipinos. Future studies may look into other sector of agriculture with different machines 
and equipment if the developed framework will work. Table 11 shows the recommended implementation of the TPM 
based framework in different levels:

Abstract 
 
Orchestration is a form of organizational response to the challenges of erratic environmental change, through 
organizational knowledge-based and collective efforts. Collaborative efforts of organizations to achieve better 
performance through ordinary capability and dynamic capability. Orchestration is performed through a combination 
of operating capabilities and dynamic capabilities, which are known as dynamic bundles. Studies to find new gaps 
are needed to expand dynamic bundles. Resources are an important factor, so orchestration is important regarding 
capabilities and resources. The combination of knowledge with capabilities is a source of organizational success. 
Knowledge-based resources, which are specialized knowledge, increase environmental awareness capabilities and 
are an important factor for performance. This paper aims to explore the role of bundles or resource configurations 
and capabilities and their contribution to performance outcomes. 
This paper proposes a dynamic bundles orchestration that includes operational capabilities and dynamic capabilities 
as well as resources. In this research, the proposed resources are knowledge resources. Knowledge-based approach 
is important as a determinant of performance. This paper also contributes to conceptual knowledge in orchestration, 
or it can be called knowledge-based orchestration. Knowledge-based orchestration is expected to encourage 
organizations that have an impact on accelerating the recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic conditions.

Abstract  
 
The main objective of the current paper is to design a forced convection thermal energy storage (TES) system 
adoptable, adaptable and affordable by small-scale tobacco farmers in Zimbabwe. The design’s fabrication would 
comprise of locally available materials. The aim of the design is to save energy resources applied in tobacco 
curing processes such as solar, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal, electricity, firewood, and paddy husks 
as is the case in Sri Lanka.  Several researchers have worked to introduce new fuel sources in tobacco curing. 
There has also been a major focus on structural improvement of tobacco barns through raising barn interior 
insulation levels, selection of ideal construction materials as well as plugging all existing and potential thermal 
leakage points during regular maintenance. No research has been carried out focusing on introduction of thermal 
energy storage systems to complement other energy utilization efficiency initiatives being taken. This paper 
specifically designs a thermal energy storage system comprising of brickwork and a steel dome as an energy 
efficiency improvement measure in tobacco curing. Apart from tobacco curing, the designed TES system would 
be applicable to drying processes of other crops such as maize, paprika and other fruits and vegetables.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Improvements suggested are that the project is scalable. Scalability will comply with similitude whereby it is an exact 
replica of any other design to all dimensions. Two objects are said to be geometrically similar if all linear length scales 
of one object are a fixed ratio of all corresponding length scales of the second object (McDonough, 2009). Also, two 
geometrically similar objects are said to be dynamically similar if the forces acting at corresponding locations on the 
two objects are everywhere in the same ratio. We require geometric similarity in order to even consider dynamic 
similarity and fulfil the design’s airflow system (McDonough, 2009). Therefore, it is a one-size fits to tobacco barns. 
 
6. Conclusion  
An ideal 5.3565m³ sensible heat thermal energy storage system was designed for use by small-scale tobacco farmers 
during curing of their crop. It is meant to complement energy-efficiency measures being undertaken by other 
researchers. With a total investment of US$2 500 which can be undertaken in phases for two years and all building 
materials locally available, the project is implementable and recommended. The benefits are the energy and raw fuel 
resource consumption reduction, deforestation reversal, marked success in agroforestry projects as well as the 
greenhouse gas emission reduction. The heat storage material are rock pebbles which are in abundance for free in the 
exception of the transportation costs.  There will be marked improvement in product quality as barns begin to receive 
consistent heating for desired energy levels. The project attains a quick payback time and profitability and it has got 
a lifetime of 20 years with minimum maintenance.

Abstract 
Large swaths of rural communities in South Africa are faced with water shortages. The Mpumalanga province is 
one of the most hard-hit areas in the country with very unskilled water administrators and old infrastructure 
exacerbating the problem. Lack of access to clean piped water affects local communities, surrounding 
agricultural farms and the few available industries in the province. The acid mine drainage at abandoned mine 
shafts also adds another dimension to the problem. In this research, the opportunities for poor communities to 
have access to potable water and also store enough water that will cater to the demand of water supply is 
investigated. The effective pumping systems strategic management are also addressed in this study to assist 
management to maintain the leaking and burst pipes. The delay in attending water related queries means more 
losses of water. An empirical investigation is conducted in the Mpumalanga province to identify the areas that 
have a water shortage and implement systems and strategies that will result in enough porTable water to the 
affected rural communities.   The development of the empirical model and its testing with data obtained through 
questionnaires administered in the province forms the focus of this paper.

1. Introduction 
In South Africa, water is a human right and the government has come up with several measures to ensure that all 
South African communities have access to this basic service at no cost. At the same time, South Africa is a 
country with a shortage of water and potable water in different areas especially rural areas. This study is focused 
on the rural areas in the Mpumalanga Province which is amongst the nine Province in South Africa. 
Mpumalanga lies in eastern side South Africa, bordering Swaziland, Kwazulu-Natal province, Free State 
province, Gauteng province, Limpopo province and Mozambique. It constitutes 6.5% of South Africa's land 
area, see Figure 1. The province has a large number of the townships, urban and rural areas and some 
surrounding industries and mines. The old mines also pollute the groundwater through the production of acid 
mine drainage (Mafanya et al, 2019a; Mafanya et al, 2019b; Mafanya, 2021). The rivers that run through 
Mpumalanga include Usutu, Crocodile, the Sabie-Sand and the Komati and the areas from which rainfall flows 
into these river channels are Olifants, Nkomazi, Usutu and Upper Vaal (Anon., 2017).

Total head at 0.05 m3/s is calculated from equation 9. 
Total Head = Hs + Hf + Hv                                                                                (9)

The calculations of the total head were carried out at different flow rates varying from 0.05 m3/s to 0.4 m3/s with the 
pipe diameter of 0.3 m and length of 45m. The final results are summarised in Table 3. It can be seen that the increase 
in the flow rate increases the total head of the pumping system 1.  
The results of the pumping system design were summarised in Table 3. The same procedure was followed to calculate 
the pumping system 2 at the length of 60m of the pipe and diameter of 0.3m. The results for pumping system 1 and 
system 2 were plotted on the same graph in Figure 5 to illustrate how the system curve will change if increasing the 
pipe length from 45 to 60 m and further. Figure 5 shows that the pumping capacity can be achieved by adjusting the 
length of the pumping system at a constant diameter of the system. Increasing the length of the pipe in a pumping 
system the head increases, see Figure 5.

6. Recommendation  
It is recommended that the municipalities hire competent engineers and operators to manage the existing 
infrastructure. The management of the infrastructure includes the plans for operations and maintenance to ensure that 
the communities get sufficient drinkable water. The municipalities should invest in training and development 
activities to the communities and teach them about the importance of saving water and working together to fight 
against vandalism. The existing infrastructures need to be maintained to avoid unplanned maintenance that comes at 
high cost to the municipalities. The pumping system needs to be designed in a way that it can accommodate more than 
the existing population so that the increase of settlement does not affect other areas with water shortages. It is 
important to also have spare parts in case there is damage to the pumping system, maintenance can be done without 
disturbing to the supply of water on a daily base. The water that is pumped from the boreholes to the reservoir and 
storage tanks need to be tested to meet the quality standard of drinkable water.  
7. Conclusion 
The study concluded that a lot of rural communities in the study areas are facing challenges with water services which 
range from lack of capacity, skilled people, illegal connections and droughts which resulted into fountains being dry

1586","and the percentage of dams decreasing. The challenges affect the delivery of water services to the communities and 
need to be addressed with the purpose of improving the water delivery. The health of people is also at risk because of 
consuming untreated water. The abstracted water needs to be treated to meet the portable quality standard for 
drinkable water before it is distributed to the consumers. The infrastructures must be maintained frequently so that the 
quality of the water does not get affected through the supplying process. To manage the increment of populations, the 
design of pumping systems is critical to help with managing the bulk of water supply and with eliminating the 
problem of illegal connections. Figure 5 shows that the water supply can be increased by increasing the length of the 
system. The total head increases and the flow rate must be kept as small as possible to avoid the damage of pumps in 
the system. The vandalism and mismanagement of water can be solved by providing training of water-wise and 
management of community facilities. Skilled people should be employed in the municipalities to help with the 
management of the existing infrastructure and innovations that will assist with meeting the water demand of the 
communities.

Abstract 
Most of poor rural communities based in the North-Eastern parts of South Africa such as in the Limpopo province 
face shortage of water with mostly no access to clean portable water. The water shortage is caused by the lack of 
proper management of the existing water systems, such that water is lost in the system through leaking and burst 
pipes. The water scarcity has become the top agenda priority for the local governments in the province especially 
considering the drought level due to lack of rain. The issue of water scarcity affects households as well as the 
industrial and agricultural sectors serving these rural communities. Most of the areas have contaminated water 
because of lack of proper purification plants and pumping systems. The purpose of this study is to model the 
water supply chain to determine the nature and causes of poor delivery in the system. System dynamic model is 
developed using the Vensim software. The system is simulated to determine opportunities for improvement. The 
systems dynamics modelling is discussed herein.

1. Introduction  
South Africa is a country with a shortage of water and portable water in different areas especially rural areas. The 
country’s population increases at a high rate but the bulk of water supply is not increasing, as a results there is 
shortage of water to supply the current settlements (Matlakala & Kallon, 2019). This study is focused on the rural 
areas in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The Limpopo Province lies in North East of South Africa 
bordering Mozambique, Mpumalanga Province, Gauteng Province, North West Province, Botswana and 
Zimbabwe, see Figure 2. Limpopo covers 10.3%, see Figures 1 and 2. The province has a large number of the 
townships, urban, rural areas and surrounding industries and mines. The old mines also pollute the groundwater 
(Mafanya et al, 2019a; Mafanya et al, 2019b; Mafanya, 2021).

1589","The primary source of drinking water for the communities is from boreholes and rain, see Figure 4. The 
municipalities in rural communities take forever to improve the infrastructures of water services as a results water 
sources get exhausted with time, see Figure 5. The decrease in the water supply is also due to lack of 
maintenance, vandalism, mismanagement of water and the increase of population. The area of study does not 
have Water Treatment Plant. The water from boreholes is pumped straight to the communities for consumption 
and domestic use. This has a higher risk to the health of the people in the communities. No water undergoes a 
standard treatment that includes pH adjustment, flocculation, settling, filtration, and chlorine disinfection so that 
the water is consumable (Matlakala, et al., 2019; Matlakala & Kallon, 2019; Matlakala, et al., 2019). The 
challenge of water supply in these areas is in the pumping systems. The pumping systems require proper 
procedures to be implemented to operate well (Matlakala & Kallon, 2019; Matlakala, et al., 2019). New 
settlement connects illegally (see Figure 8) on the mainline that supply the old communities, as a result, the 
capacity of water does not reach the designated destination. Poor maintenance of infrastructure also affects the 
supply of water because of water lost during the distribution period (Matlakala, et al., 2020; Matlakala, et al., 
2019). The pumping system is also at risk to be damaged due to the high amount of load that it was not designed 
for. The study shows that for the pumping system to last longer, the load in the pumping system must not exceed 
the normal load (Matlakala, et al., 2019). 
 
Figure 8: Illegal connection and leaking pipes 
 
The system dynamics in Figure 6 is developed to assist with management of water supply and the population 
growth. The rate at which the population is increasing should always correspond to the service of water supply as 
is shown in Figure 7. The decrease of water resources in Figure 7 indicates that there should be an improvement 
of the infrastructures to accommodate the increase of the population. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this study, a systems dynamic model was developed to investigate the interaction between the population and 
water sources in rural areas of Limpopo Province. The results in Figure 7 shows that if there is no proper type of 
management, the rural areas will suffer a shortage of water. It is also worth noting (referring from Figure 7) that 
the communities did not lack water at the beginning but due to lack of proper management there was water 
shortage. The study areas are facing challenges with water services range from lack of capacity, skilled people, 
illegal connections and droughts. The challenges affect the delivery of water services to the communities and 
need to be addressed with the purpose to improve the water delivery. The health of people is also at risk because 
of consuming untreated water. The abstracted water needs to be treated to meet the portable quality standards for 
drinkable water before it is distributed to the consumers. The infrastructures must be maintained regularly so that 
they can last for a longer period. Figure 7 shows that the demand of water supply can be increased and as the 
population increases this will start to decrease over the months. The systems dynamic model (Figure 4 and 6) 
helps with determining the population growth and management of water services. The systems dynamic model 
gives the opportunities to improve the water services and manage the population. The vandalism and 
mismanagement of water can be addressed well by providing trainings that will help with management of 
community facilities and water. Continues training is required to develop people in the municipalities to help with

Abstract 
 
Several studies have explained that the implementation of E-learning in universities has been widely 
implemented and has provided many benefits, such as providing effectiveness and efficiency in the learning process. 
However, based on observations in several universities that have not implemented e-learning, it is constrained by the 
cost of making an e-learning system and the infrastructure needed to support e-learning implementation. The purpose 
of this paper is to help universities implement e-learning at a relatively low cost and flexible. The final result of this 
research is an open source based e-learning model using cloud computing technology

1. Introduction  
An effective learning process will produce satisfactory learning output in accordance with the targeted goals. 
Learning objectives can vary depending on the institution that carries them out but in general the purpose of learning 
is to increase knowledge and expertise and both of these can be obtained well if supported by an effective learning 
process. The satisfaction resulting from an effective learning process will be accepted by all stakeholders such as 
students, teachers, parents, management of educational institutions and others. Satisfaction means satisfaction in the 
process carried out and the results obtained 
On the other hand, the use and development of information technology is used in almost all aspects of human 
life because the use of information technology provides many benefits and conveniences for human life. One aspect 
that currently uses information technology a lot is the field of education with e-learning. E-learning provides several 
benefits in the learning process and convenience for students and teachers. As an example of e-learning it can shorten

Abstract 
Materials Handling (MH) is one of the most essential aspects within manufacturing processes and/or industries. 
MH equipment are mechanical equipment used for the movement, storage, control and protection of materials, 
goods, and products throughout the process of manufacturing, distribution, consumption, and disposal. 
Transportation equipment used in manufacturing industries varies from pallet jack to forklift trucks and/or cranes. 
The size and type of a Material Handling System (MHS) and/or equipment influences the effectivity of the internal 
logistics within manufacturing industries. Therefore, it is very essential to choose a correct MHS for a correct 
manufacturing process which requires material handling to complete its operation. Incorrect usage or selection of 
an MHS for an operational process may lead to down time, damage to facility, increase in operating costs and/or 
pose Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) risks to workers [7,8].  
Over the years, many South African industries have been using Forklift trucks to move bigger loads from one point 
to another till today. The use of large forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing processes poses OHS risks to 
workers as its Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) produces fumes (Carbon Monoxide, CO) when in operation and 
exhaust fumes, (CO), are harmful to human’s health. On this basis, a new system design is recommended to 
eliminate the use of MHS that relies on ICE power source to prevent OHS risks in indoor manufacturing industries. 
In this project, Autodesk Inventor Professional software was used for design development of technical drawings 
and simulation as well as validation of the new system’s structure. Vehicle Dynamics’ principles and equations 
are used to determine the overall Rolling Resistance, Tractive Effort of the new system, wheel torque, and the 
power required to drive the system under 20 – ton load capacity. The new system design has been developed to 
operate using a Hydraulic Power pack source, where it consists of four hydraulic wheel hubs for driving the system, 
four hydraulic cylinders for lifting & lowering, and a double rod end hydraulic cylinder for steering. Electro-
Hydraulic circuit systems were developed and proposed using electronics and fluid mechanics phenomena. Again, 
principles, laws and equations of Strength of Materials has been carried out for validation of the material selection 
of the new design system’s structure as well as verifying buckling, deflection & bending stresses, and moments

Abstract 
 
This study aims to open insights to the Indonesian people, especially readers, about the potential for digital economic 
growth in Indonesia as a new economic source that can be broadly developed to become a new area of economic 
growth for the community as well as land for the country's foreign exchange-earners if it is processed carefully. by 
the government itself. However, we need to know; there are still many obstacles that must be faced by Indonesia in 
the development of the digital economy in Indonesia itself. Lack of education and training regarding technology such 
as the internet, computers, and other digital technologies for the public can hinder the development of the digital 
economy in Indonesia itself. In this paper, we will discuss these two problems and how to solve them. First, there 
needs to be participation from the community itself to develop themselves in learning skills in using electronic media 
such as computers, the internet, and building simple websites. Second, the government also needs to have a vision for 
the future, especially in seeing the opportunities for the development of the digital economy in Indonesia. One way to 
do this is by making regulations related to the use and operation of the digital economy. So, when the digital economy 
has begun to develop, the government can solve the problems that exist in it. Why are we optimistic in discussing the 
digital economy? Because of the results of the research that has been carried out in March 2020, the use of digital 
economy platforms in Indonesia is increasing. Nearly 70% of internet users search for or buy products on digital 
platforms such as Shopee or Tokopedia. This proves the good prospects of the digital economy in Indonesia. Finally, 
the benefits that you will get from reading this paper are getting insight into the prospects for the digital economy in 
Indonesia and on things that need to be considered in developing the digital economy in Indonesia. So, the 
development of the digital economy in Indonesia can grow faster and can revive the nation's economy.

1. Introduction 
In the millennial era like today, the internet is an important thing that everyone must have in carrying out their daily 
activities (Mäkelä, 2013). Increasingly day by day, more and more people worldwide, mostly Indonesians, are using 
internet services to support their daily (Christiadi et al., 2018).  Not only is it a recommendation, but the internet and 
introduction to the digital world have become demands for Indonesians at this time. The growing use of the internet is 
accompanied by the high need for electronic devices that become a medium for connecting to the virtual world (Ratna, 
2011). This, of course, opens the Indonesian people's mindset about the great opportunities we have in the era of 
digitalization like today ini (Rasmitadila et al., 2020). In ancient times, we were much looking for information through 
books that we had to get by buying at a bookstore or borrowing books from the library, which took time and money. 
Besides, mobilizing to reach the place can, of course, be a waste of time. Likewise in ancient times, we had to buy a 
product by making notes in a notebook or piece of paper and then, we went to the destination with the possibility that 
the item was for sale at that place. However, what if the item is not sold at the shop? Of course, we have to buy these 
items in stores, or other places, which of course looking for these items from a store to store is a waste of time and costs 
quite a lot. Not to mention the lack of efficiency. 
Today, our lives are much helped by the digitization era (Abdullah, 2020). All forms of activity are greatly assisted by 
the presence of the internet and the development of existing technology (Novari, 2020). At this time humans can quickly 
get information through various websites and search engines that we can access via the internet media. Besides, the

to the middle sector. The nation's welfare is more evenly distributed, and there is no economic gap in Indonesia. 
Several steps that the government has taken since 2014 under the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs 
coordination together with the Ministry of Communication and Information to support the advancement of the digital 
economy in Indonesia. Together with e-commerce entrepreneurs, the government works by mobilizing experts 
regionally and globally to synergistically build and develop the right ecosystem for developing the digital economy and 
industry in Indonesia. Face-to-face workshops or coaching and appeals to business people can be steps to build 
awareness of business people, especially MSMEs and SMEs, to participate in the digital economy, which is a promising 
new land for the growth development of the Indonesian economy equally. There are five main principles in developing 
the digital economy designed by the government through affirmative steps, namely: 
1. Every Indonesian citizen has the same opportunity to access digital channels and become a business actor. 
2. Every Indonesian citizen has the right to know to utilize digital technology to be used as a medium for economic 
activity. 
3. Every action by the government is to minimize job losses in the event of a transition to the digital economy. 
4. Every legal action that occurs must have a clear and definite legal basis to maintain legal stability in economic 
activities. 
5. Every vision and mission must be lived out transparently and welcome the digital economy internationally. 
We know that the Indonesian government aims to advance the digital economy for significant people in business and 
middle-low to middle-class economic players through these five principles. Furthermore, justice in doing digital 
business can support the Indonesian economy from its foundation so that the Indonesian state's progress can occur. 
Furthermore, we know that the government will provide education about the use of digital technology to all existing 
groups as a vehicle for introduction, which can then be done by holding workshops, working with digital retail owners 
to introduce capabilities, and digital technology can do to help the progress of the Indonesian economy. The government 
can also provide insight and knowledge by cooperating with investors to build business incubators for creative business 
people so they can develop their business through the digital economy. It is also known that every country's activity 
must be based on a precise and definite legal basis. So, the government also underlies every digital economic activity 
based on the applicable law in Indonesia, and any criminal acts that occur in the digital domain of the Indonesian state 
will be processed using the laws applicable in the country of Indonesia. Finally, we know that the economy is currently 
happening in the international economy or the global economy to welcome the global economy. The Indonesian state 
must have the right vision and mission to advance Indonesia's digital economy to compete globally and become a trusted 
partner for other foreign countries. It can also be achieved if the government acts transparently in every achievement in 
building the digital economy and building the right ecosystem to grow Indonesia's digital economy. 
Targeting the middle to lower-middle-class to the middle class to be aware of the massive potential of the digital 
economy in Indonesia, of course, requires the cooperation of several government agencies. In addition to cooperation 
between the Ministry of Economic and the Ministry of Information and Technology, there is a need for cooperation 
with even smaller parts of the government. For example, cooperation between the Regent or Mayor and the cooperative 
institution is a savings and loan institution often used by middle to lower-class business actors. Where cooperatives can 
act as a bridge to convey the government's vision and mission to build the digital economy evenly from small to large 
businesses, the government must also continue to provide appeals through every state's apparatus to build the trust of 
every business actor in the vision and mission and the goals the government wants to achieve. The potential possessed 
by the digital economy in Indonesia is enormous. Especially for creatives and innovators in Indonesia in general. At 
this time, internet users are increasing day by day, and products are not only seen by the local community or the national 
community. However, the product can be seen and also purchased by the international community. It is beneficial for 
business people in Indonesia; this can increase foreign exchange through taxes and money exchange conducted by 
business people. They were talking about the country's foreign exchange earnings. 
 
6. Conclusions 
It can be concluded that Indonesia's digital economy has great potential to advance the wheels of the nation's economy. 
Especially in the Industrial 4.0 era like today. The critical role of the internet, digital retail, and search engines is 
increasingly essential; it also triggers a market shift where more people are turning to buy products online. Certainly 
makes it easier for consumers to buy the products they want. We also conclude that the government must provide 
alternatives for Indonesia to prepare good jobs when there is a shift in Indonesia's economic culture, which has begun 
to shift to the digital economy. Wherewith this cultural shift, of course, there is a reshuffle in the form of organization 
that must be carried out by middle-class and upper-class companies. We can also conclude that there are still many 
Indonesians who have not realized the potential of the digital economy in Indonesia. In particular, for those who are 
middle to lower middle-class business people. So, it is necessary to share insights with the community of MSME and

Abstract  
 
This research investigates the relationship between five factors of job satisfaction and organizational performance in 
Pakistan's banking sector. In this sense, to analyze the structural and measurement model relations between the 
constructs, 280 valid questionnaires were composed of employees from Pakistan's banking sector. In this study, partial 
least square (PLS) 3.2.9 were used, whereas both the Fornell-Larcker criteria and the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio 
(HTMT) were used discriminant validity in this study. For organizational performance, supervision, fringe benefits, 
and contingent rewards were suitable. This study's mixed findings have indicated that specific hypotheses such as pay 
and promotion have been rejected depending on their connection to organizational performance. The survey results in 
significant consequences for bank executives and decision-makers, and researchers and illustrates the relevance of 
banks' performance. This research sheds new light on the relationship between the job satisfaction survey by spector's 
(1985), including pay, promotion, supervision, fringe benefits, and contingent rewards with organizational 
performance. It seems to be the various research suggested in the banking sector of Pakistan.   
 
Keywords: Job satisfaction, Organizational performance, Banking sector, Pakistan  
 
1. Introduction 
Employees in the banking sector acquire a great deal from routine activities, and the whole organization experiences 
a significant loss if they cause employees dissatisfaction in their work (Shaikh et al., 2019). Several previous types of 
research have shown that workplace satisfaction influences multiple managerial aspects, such as commitment (Valaei 
and Rezaei, 2016), turnover of employees (Stamolampros et al., 2019), organizational change (Yousef, 2017), style 
of leadership, and corporate culture (Pawirosumarto et al., 2017). Simultaneously, all these variables impact the 
organization's performance (Lim et al., 2017). Previous research also demonstrates the relation between job 
satisfaction and organizational performance (Pang and Lu, 2018), job performance (Valaei and Rezaei, 2016), and 
organizational commitment (Asrar-ul-Haq et al., 2017). Rarely has the correlation between job satisfaction and 
organizational performance been realized, especially in the sense of the public banking sector. There are several 
studies on and in the banking sector; job satisfaction was not the organizational performance analysis. The effect of 
job satisfaction on organizational success has been examined in a small range of investigations (Al-dalahmeh et al., 
2018). The cumulative component of any employee's job satisfaction in the organization is operational performance 
(Bakotić, 2016). Organizations must maintain job satisfaction among their workers to boost performance (Kanyurhi 
and Bugandwa Mungu Akonkwa, 2016). Organizations are more successful if the organization's employees are more 
pleased with their work (Ukil, 2016). In an organization that helps companies enhance their financial and non-financial 
results, human assets are essential, and organizations would not increase their performance (Gogan et al., 2016). 
 
There is also no consensus on the correlation between job satisfaction of organizational workers and 
organizational performance. A few pieces of research, however, have developed a constructive relationship between 
job satisfaction and organizational performance (Bakotić, 2016; Muterera et al., 2015; Coggburn et al., 2014; Mafini 
and Pooe, 2013), and some other studies have defined an inverse relationship (Zeffane et al., 2017; Kanyurhi and 
Bugandwa Mungu Akonkwa, 2016); Coggburn et al., 2014). There is an inconsequential association between

1. Introduction  
Strategy of any company considers different areas of business operations, such as, e.g.: supplies, production, 
marketing, finance, and logistics. The growth of international business forced out changes in supplies of goods and 
services to the consumer market, so logistics strategy understood as the set of guiding principles, driving forces, and 
ingrained attitudes that help to coordinate goals, plans, and policies and which are reinforced through conscious and 
subconscious behavior within and between partners across the network. (Talevski, 2017). When logistics strategy is 
put in place in a company, the competitiveness of the latter grows, both when logistics services are rendered by firms 
manufacturing goods and services, as well as when such services are bought from external service-providers from the 
transport-shipping-logistics company 
Since logistics progressive from 1950s, there were many explorations intensive on this area in dissimilar 
area. Due to the tendency of nationalization and globalization in current periods, the reputation of logistics supervision 
has been rising in numerous areas. For businesses, logistics assistances to optimize the current manufacture and 
delivery procedures based on the similar resources concluded management techniques for endorsing the effectiveness 
and attractiveness of organization. The important component in a logistics is transport system, which linkages the 
divided actions. Transportation inhabits one-third of the sum in the logistics charges and transport systems effect the 
concert of logistics system enormously. Transporting is essential in the whole manufacture events, from industrial to 
distribution to the last customers and proceeds. One a good management among each section would take the profits 
to a determined. 
In literature, there is a rare amount of publications which mention to the logistics near corporate management. 
Seeing the background connected to the development in attractiveness in the SMEs, logistics take a significant 
element. The assortment of a combined strategy needs correct acknowledgement of logistics procedures. Hence, 
business information about singularities experimental in the area converts crucial, lengthways with the information 
about difficulties connected to the fields of organization. This, in turn, results in the fact that it is necessary to 
complement knowledge, using numerous available sources. At current, the grouping of information connected to 
logistics procedures with management approaches converts a requirement for SMEs. Hence, logistics in SMESs

Abstract 
 
Mountain climbing is a challenging natural activity that requires days and quite a lot of equipment stored in a backpack, 
which is usually called a mountain backpack. Mountain backpacks that already exist in the Indonesian market today 
tend to be designed according to male or unisex posture. Based on preliminary data from the Nordic Body Map 
questionnaire distributed to twelve female climbers at Diponegoro University, there were complaints in the neck, back, 
shoulders, and waist due to the use of mountain backpacks on the market today. Therefore, it is necessary to redesign 
the mountain backpack for female climbers. The consideration included technical, anthropometry, physiological, 
biomechanics, and usability. The results showed that female climbers wanted comfortable mountain backpacks. In the 
anthropometric aspect, the design of mountain backpacks is focused on the back pads and main straps. In the 
physiology aspect, the new design of mountain backpacks has a pattern of changes in the rate of change of working 
pulse smaller. It is found that the design of new mountain backpacks gives less pressure than the old designs. The 
usability test result found that the new design mountain backpack has a higher usability value than the old design 
mountain backpack.

Introduction 
Outdoor activities are currently favoured by various groups, both students, students, workers, and others. Nature 
presents various types of sports that are challenging to do. Many nature-loving communities exist throughout 
Indonesia, both high schools, universities, and other communities. The community has the same goal of doing outdoor 
activities and preserving nature. One of them is WAPEALA UNDIP, a student mountaineering club at Diponegoro 
University. 
 
Mountain climbing is one of the outdoor sports, which is full of challenges (Harley 2007). Climbing to the top of the 
highest mountain takes days. The climb requires much equipment. All equipment is stored in a backpack, which is 
often called a mountain backpack. Therefore, the mountain backpack must be designed appropriately so that it is safe 
and comfortable when used. 
 
Factors to consider in choosing a mountain backpack are the size, function, price, comfort, material, and model 
capacity. When assessed in terms of ergonomics, the primary consideration factor is comfort. This comfort factor is 
directly related to the user's body posture and dimension. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust anthropometry in 
producing this mountain backpack so that when the mountain backpack is used, it does not cause injury or muscle 
fatigue to climbers. Anthropometric adjustments have already begun to be applied by mountain equipment 
manufacturers in producing mountain backpacks. However, most of backpack sold in market are brands from Europe 
and America. 
 
Based on preliminary survey, Indonesian mountain bag manufacturers tend to use anthropometry of Asian male 
climbers and pay less attention to Asian female climbers. Whereas at this time, Asian female climbers, especially 
Indonesia, are increasing. The number of female climbers in WAPEALA UNDIP has increased in the past two years. 
The unavailability of a mountain bag that fit with women's anthropometry causes Indonesian female climbers to tend

The wants and needs of consumers with the highest percentage of mountain bag value criteria, namely, back system, 
frame, main strap, material, and colour. The size of the mountain bag design after calculating the width of the bag is 
42 cm, the width of the back base is 26 cm, the height of the bag is 69 cm, height of the back base is 61 cm, the length 
of the central rope is 101 cm, and the width of the main rope is 5 cm. 
 
The physiological aspect shows that the average working pulse and percentage of the proposed design CVL are smaller 
than the old design. So that the proposed design is less likely to feel work fatigue. At the Rating Perceived Exertion 
value, the old design is smaller than and the proposed design. RPE is a measurement of physical workload subjectively, 
so it has participants' presumptions that have the same feelings towards product valuation. 
 
In the biomechanical value, the proposed design of the mountain backpack has a smaller value than the old design. So, 
it has a smaller risk of experiencing MSDs complaints. In the usability factor, the proposed design mountain bag has 
a higher value than the old design. The proposed design mountain bag can be interpreted as more able to be used by 
participants than the old design.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to analyse the implementation level of quality management system ISO 9001 in Electricity 
Sector Company in Indonesia, including the barriers during the implementation. Quantitative analysis is performed to 
determine the implementation level of ISO 9001 based on the seven quality management principles.  The data in this 
descriptive study were obtained through a survey. A number of 84, out of 105 samples of PT ABC business units that 
are engaged in electricity generation, transmission, distribution, or supporting units in Indonesia participated in the 
survey. The questionnaire in the survey is developed based on previous studies and the quality management system 
standard. The results show that process approach, customer focus, evidence-based decision making, relationship 
management, leadership principle, and improvement have near to good implementation level, while engagement of 
people have a slightly good implementation level. The results also indicate that there are five main barriers in which 
were experienced during the implementation of ISO 9001, consisting of two behavioural and cultural barriers, two 
technical barriers, and one organizational barrier.

Introduction 
The Law No 30 (2009), which regulates electricity in Indonesia, emphasizes that electricity has an important 
contribution and strategic role in supporting the achievement of national development goals. PT. ABC is a State-
Owned Enterprise (BUMN) which is responsible for providing electricity supply to the public. The electricity supply 
business activities carried out by PT ABC include electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and electricity 
sales. Based on PT ABC's statistical publications, at the end of 2018, the number of PT ABC’s customers reached 
71.917.397 customers with electricity sales reaching 234.617.88 GWh (Giga Watt-hours). In providing electricity 
services to the customers, PT ABC has to meet the service quality level based on the Decree of the Directorate General 
of Electricity. PT ABC implements Quality Management System (QMS) ISO 9001 in all of its business units to meet 
the specified service quality level and to achieve customer satisfaction, and to meet the requirements of other relevant 
stakeholders such as the government. 
 
However, companies do not always get the desired results when implementing ISO 9001 due to ineffective 
implementation (Psomas et al. 2010). Most companies experience problems in implementing ISO 9001, both during 
the certification process and after the certification process (Chow‐Chua et al. 2003). Hence, identifying the barriers 
and obstacles in implementing ISO 9001 will help to increase its effectiveness to improve the company’s performance 
and to build sustainable competitive advantage (Psomas et al. 2010). The company's actions in dealing with barriers 
encountered when implementing ISO 9001 quality management system can support the achievement of the objectives 
and effectiveness of its implementation. Therefore, this study aims to examine the implementation level of quality 
management system ISO 9001 in the electricity sector company and identify its main barriers. Although there are so 
many ISO 9001 related studies, however, studies on ISO 9001 at the electricity sector company, especially in 
Indonesia, is very limited. Hence, the results are expected to provide insights on the implementation level of ISO 9001, 
along with the main barriers at PT ABC’s business units, and recommendations of actions to deal with the problems.

Abstract 
 
In industrial applications, it is essential to know and estimate the Handgrip Strength (HGS) of workers to accordingly 
designate them to appropriate job specifications. Most of the manufacturing companies have a manual or semi-
automatic product processing unit; thus, it will require an ample amount of dexterity that constitutes to the exertion of 
grip force. This study aims to assess the relationship between the Anthropometric and Handgrip Strength of the 
manufacturing workers that can be used both the industrial sector and government implementing agencies. Nine hand 
dimensions and thirteen body measurements in standing position with the HGS considering both genders were tested 
among sixty participants. The HGS of both hands were used in developing regression models for Anthropometric 
Measurements and Demographic Profile. The results show that the gender, age group, tenure, five hand dimensions 
and nine body measurements in standing position significantly affects the HGS. The findings will provide companies 
and government labour and safety agencies comprehensive information on the Anthropometric and Handgrip Strength 
measurements of the manufacturing workers. The results therefore can provide relevant perspectives in terms of the 
proper designation of workers and improves the ergonomics and safety of the workers employed both in domestic and 
international workplaces.

voluntary effort for each trial. The individual's different conditions, including pain in joints and other deficiencies, 
were not shown and could have influenced the HGS result. 
 
5. Conclusion 
An experiment was conducted to assess the relationship of the Handgrip Strength with the demographic profile, hand 
dimensions, and body measurements in the standing position of male and female manufacturing workers. The analysis 
showed that among the subjects identified demographic profile, the age group and gender were the only variables that 
are statistically correlated with the Handgrip Strength as well as with hand dimensions and body measurements in 
standing position. Pearson correlation showed that both the hand dimensions (hand length, maximum handbreadth, 
index finger length, middle finger length, and ring finger length) and body measurements in standing position (vertical 
grip reach, knuckle height, fingertip height, elbow height, eye height, stature, span, upper limb height, and shoulder 
grip length) have a positive correlation with Handgrip Strength.  
It is concluded that the age group and gender affect the outcome of the handgrip force. Generally, 18-32 years have a 
higher grip force than the 33-46 years for both males and females. It also shows that males have a higher variation of 
grip force than females for both age groups. The multivariate results noticed a significant correlation between HGS 
and body measurements in standing position with age group and gender. The findings of this study can estimate the 
handgrip force from the gender, age group, hand dimension, and body measurements in standing position.  
 
This research would be potentially considered as the first comprehensive study in the Philippines with regards to 
identifying the relationship between the Handgrip Strength and Anthropometric measurements of Filipino 
manufacturing workers. This study serves as the first step in making an Anthropometric and handgrip standard for a 
specific job requirement in industrial applications. The study’s academic perspectives, therefore, could further 
improve the efficiency, safety, and health of the manufacturing workers and will eventually improve the company 
profits. 
 
Future studies could increase the number of participants and age groups to widen the span of the results. And to 
identify if there are any differences among the work departments handgrip strength values and requirements. And to 
use structural equation modelling since it could estimate multiple and interrelated dependence in single analysis a 
more efficient way of evaluating the data.

Abstract 
 
This research examined the risk perceptions of workers in the petroleum processing industry sector. The background 
of this study was based on the exploitation, production, and distribution activities in the oil and gas industry sector 
which are extensively carried out to meet high market demand. However, it also needs to be balanced with a sound 
safety system to prevent workplace accidents. The main idea of this study was slightly different from previous 
research. The approach used is the perspective of workers to find safety risks that frequently occurred in their work 
environment. This study employed the structural equation modelling (SEM) method to find out the main factors that 
influence workers' perception of the occupational safety risk. Based on the result of the analysis, individual attitude & 
behaviour and work situation & target are two factors that have a strong influence on workers risk perception. This 
finding is essential for further analysis in developing action plans for accident preventions in a company, particularly 
in the petroleum processing industry sector.

Introduction 
The oil and gas industry in Indonesia have a very vital role in the sustainability of various community activities and 
operational activities of various industrial sectors. Oil and gas have become a vital commodity for the community. 
The public is increasingly aware that Indonesia's wealth of natural oil and gas resources has limitations. The amount 
of crude oil reserves continues to decline, but consumption and demand for petroleum continue to increase. Therefore, 
natural resources in the form of oil and gas must be managed well and safely, and their use must be in an efficient 
manner. Oil and gas operational activities in Indonesia can be classified as vulnerable to various hazards that have 
been mentioned, as evidenced by the many cases of work accidents in the Indonesian oil and gas operating 
environment (California Emergency Management Agency 2014).  
 
The key to implementing a work safety management system in the petroleum industry environment is compliance 
with all regulations that have been established by the government. Starting from the competency standards of oil and 
gas workers in the work safety sector to the management of various types of sources of danger that are anticipated 
early on. Work accidents or risk of exposure to diseases due to accidentally touching chemicals that are included in 
the category of hazardous substances or germs can be avoided and minimized. The risk of fire or gas explosion that 
may occur due to the impact of oil and gas operational activities can also be reduced. In short, various kinds of risks 
in the operational activities of the oil and gas industry must be managed well (Hughes and Ferret 2003).  
 
In this study, researchers want to contribute in the development of the Safety Risk Perception model to find out what 
factors affect Safety Risk Perception according to the perspective of workers at the refinery and provide 
recommendations for improvement on the factors that most influence to increase safety and prevent work accidents in 
the refinery environment reappears later on. Researchers will use 2 statistical methods, namely the linear regression 
method and the structural equation modelling (SEM) method. The two methods will give different results, but this 
will enrich the Analysis material to show what factors influence the risk perception of workers in the oil refinery 
environment. Later these factors can be used as a reference to provide suggestions for improvements to reduce the 
number of work accidents in the oil refinery environment (Wang and Zou 2015).

Conclusion 
Work accidents, especially in the petroleum processing industry sector, are not something that cannot be avoided. One 
effort to prevent work accidents is by anticipating unsafe actions and unsafe behaviour long before the accident occurs. 
Another effort is to map the factors that have an influence on risk perception from the perspective of the worker. Based 
on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the main factors causing occupational accidents are individual 
attitude & behaviour and situation and work target. So, the company can make improvement in these factors to avoid 
occupational accidents happen later on. Where workers spend a lot of time directly in the work location with various 
kinds of hazards attached to their work. By doing this research, it will provide benefits to find out the factors that 
influence the safety risk perception of workers in the oil refinery industry.

After discussing some theories that address this research topic, latent variables and indicator variables are used to 
measure perceptions of safety risk from the worker's perspective. The variables are arranged from several references 
and designed a model. The model was designed by this author is called the initial model. From the initial model, a 
questionnaire will be designed for workers. Where each indicator variable is developed into 1 question item. Total 
respondents who answered the study were 80 workers. 
 
Stage 3: 
Next, a field test is conducted. Where the authors visited the site for a work safety management system in the refinery 
area, as well as distributing questionnaires to workers in the refinery environment. After getting the results of the 
questionnaire, the results will be recapitulated, then analysis using the Structural Equation Modelling method (SEM). 
Furthermore, the output from the SEM method will show what factors have an influence on the perception of safety 
risk. In the next stage, factors which have an influence on the perception of safety risk will be carried out. Furthermore, 
the results of this analysis will be developed into an improved repair to improve the perception of safety risks of 
workers in the environment and prevent damage that occurs in the future.

Abstract 
To maintain its presence in society, malls need to maintain and increase the loyalty of their customers. Nowadays, 
customers prefer malls that have high value and give more satisfaction to them. Based on preliminary surveys, it 
shows that people who are satisfied with mall is not necessarily loyal to the mall. This study effort to find the 
relation of the mall’s environment and value to the customer’s value, satisfaction, and loyalty using Structural 
Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS). The results show that the most significant positive effect on 
customer’s loyalty is mall’s value. Recommendations are given to mall developers relating to the mall’s value 
variable, namely ""wow factor"" for the mall brand and use of technological advancements to facilitate transactions 
between customers and outlets, and ease for customers to get promotional information.

Introduction 
Indonesia gets 3rd ranks with the best economic growth among G-20 member countries (Medistiara 2016). High 
economic growth may indirectly increase people's purchasing power (Ahman 2007). But different things happen 
in the retail industry, the Indonesian Retailers Association (APRINDO) states that throughout the January to June 
2017 the growth of the retail industry is under five percent, the rate has been in decline over the last few years 
(Fauzi 2017). 
 
The value of transactions in the sector of e-commerce and online shopping grew between 2015 to 2021 averaged 
at 21% per year, it can be seen from the increase in e-commerce transactions of 2015 that were only 4.61 billion 
dollars to 5.65 billion dollars in 2016 (Wardhani et al. 2017). In this era of tight business competition, the pattern 
of public expenditure is changing towards e-commerce, which would become a challenge for an offline retail shop 
like mall or shopping center. One of them was also a challenge for malls located in the city of Semarang, Indonesia. 
 
To maintain its presence in the middle of society, the mall needs to maintain and increase the loyalty of its 
customers. Nowadays customers prefer malls that have high value and give more satisfaction to them (El-Adly 
and Eid 2016). Preliminary surveys are conducted on 62 respondents who are customers of three malls (malls A, 
B, and C) in Semarang. The level of customer satisfaction depends on some of the attributes that exist in the mall, 
including the interior design of the mall, the existing facilities within the mall, timeliness of operational malls, 
parking attendant services, security facilities and the cleanliness of the mall. 
 
Based on preliminary surveys that have been done, it is known that as many as 90% of respondents are satisfied 
with mall A but only 24% of respondents frequently visit this mall, but in mall B 74% of respondents are satisfied 
with the mall and 69% of respondents frequently visit this mall. This shows that people who are satisfied with a 
mall are not necessarily loyal to the mall. Furthermore, for mall C, only 53% of respondents were satisfied with 
the mall and only 6% of respondents frequently visited this mall. This shows that the low level of satisfaction 
results in a small number of people who will often visit a mall. From the explanation above, there is no correlation 
between customer satisfaction and loyalty, so we need to know the actual factors that cause people to frequently 
visit a mall or be loyal to a mall.

1666","mediation is the relationship between exogenous with endogenous variables through the variable. This means that 
the influence of exogenous variables on endogenous variables can directly, but also through mediating variables. 
In this study mediating variables are Customer Satisfaction and Mall Value. In this case, Customer Satisfaction is 
mediating the relation of Mall Environment and Customer Loyalty, as well as Mall Value also be mediating the 
relationship between Mall Environment and Customer Loyalty. Mediating variables aim to explain the effect of 
the relationship between exogenous variables on endogenous variables through the mediator variable (Solimun 
2010). Value as a mediating variable Mall, its presence is very important to make the Mall Environment able to 
reach Customer Loyalty. For example, if the arrangement of the outlets in the mall easier for customers to get the 
items they are looking for, then the customer will feel the utilitarian value of the mall, thus makes the customer 
loyal. The result support with research by El Adly and Eid (2016) in which the relationship between Mall 
Environment to Customer Loyalty would be better if the Value Mall mediating variable. Based on research Keng 
et. al. (2007), customer interaction with mall environments positively affects the value of the experience gained 
customers, causing a desire to return to the mall to shop and recommend it to others. Thus, if Mall Environment 
is considered by customers will have a positive impact on the Value Mall will cause customers loyal to the mall. 
Also, Mall Value positively mediates the relationship between the Mall Environment and Customer Satisfaction. 
5.   
Conclusion  
Mall customer loyalty is defined as the tendency of customers to continue shopping at the mall and recommend it 
to others (Rabbanee  et al 2012). Customers visiting a shopping mall not only separate but also for other activities 
such as entertainment (Rabbanee  et al 2012). In this case, the developer’s mall utilizes customer loyalty to 
increase sales at outlets in the mall, which in turn can provide a profit for the owners of the mall (Rabbanee  et al 
2012). 
 
Based on the results of the research hypothesis and the calculation of effects between latent variables in the model 
of this research is that the variables provide the most significant positive effect on customer loyalty is Mall Value. 
To maintain and increase customer loyalty to mall in the city, recommendations are given to the developer of the 
mall will include matters relating to the variable Mall Value. The first recommendation is bringing up the ""Wow 
Factor"" at Brand Mall because the customer of shopping center goes to the mall not just to shop alone, but also 
for entertainment, in this case, shopping center must excel in four fields, mall design, high comfort level, diverse 
brands as well as the diversity of drinks and food sold therein (Caulfield 2015). The second is the development of 
technology should be an opportunity for the owner of the mall where the mall owner can use that not only link 
between the consumer and the retailer physically but also digitally. Allowing consumers to search for products or 
services online and purchase offline, or purchase online and then pick up the goods at the outlets (Robaton 2016). 
The third, the use of smartphones is common in today's society, thus smartphone applications on the utilization 
can be optimized. One of them is by using the Beacon, a device that is capable of communicating with the 
smartphone by using signal BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) within a certain range. These beacons are installed in 
the mall. Beacon works by the activation of applications that exist within smartphone so Beacon works with the 
user's permission. Through this technology, a consumer does not need to open the application because an 
automatic message will be sent to the consumer smartphone. It is not only sending promotional messages but also 
a reminder system on the application where the application will remind users ""wishlist"" that have been made 
previously (Robaton 2016).

Abstract 
 
Consumer needs in Muslim Clothing product development have become the basic needs of designers developing 
products. Muslim clothes are a product that is growing very fast in Indonesia. One tool to determine the needs of 
consumers today is Online Product Reviews (OPRs). OPRs are written by consumers and tell about their satisfaction 
with the products that they have purchased. OPRs are also useful for online shops on e-commerce platforms to support 
purchasing decisions, build consumer trust, and show shop reputation. This paper aims to examine the use of OPRs 
from an e-commerce business perspective capable of influencing consumer buying decisions in an online and offline 
store and knowing whether OPRs influence the designers in developing Muslim clothing product design. In this 
research findings, OPRs and star ratings influence consumer’s buying decisions. For designers, OPRs might affect in 
design development. It provides information product requirements from consumers from positive or negative reviews. 
Some statements in OPRs were incompatible with the personal opinion of the designer. This review provides new 
insights for the upcoming study in the field of online shop user rankings, evaluations and designers.

1. Introduction 
Some well-known e-commerce platforms in Indonesia, such as Shopee, Bukalapak, Tokopedia, Lazada, and others, 
grow significantly in Indonesia. In e-commerce, exciting things to be observed are written review and product rating 
in the form of numerical value and star rating. Product reviews are writings from consumers that indicate the level of 
customer satisfaction. If satisfied, write positive sentiments, if disappointed, write negative sentiments (Constantinides 
and Holleschovsky 2016). The level of customer satisfaction is not only revealed in the form of sentence reviews, but 
consumers also showed with star rating. Star rating consists of five types, started from one star showing 
disappointment to five stars showing satisfaction on product or services (Von Helversen et al. 2018). Two-way 
communication from consumers and shop owners is interesting to discuss (Ketelaar et al. 2015). The different nature 
of reviews, with unstructured language when written OPRs, the question is how other customers able to use 
information sources from OPRs to make decisions about buying products (Von Helversen et al. 2018). Another 
question is whether reviews on OPRs can help designers to develop their product design as customers’ requirements 
or product features. In OPRs, consumers are free to write negative or positive statements.  
 
In this study, the OPRs data were taken from 200 data reviews from online shop brand x, then those reviews confirmed 
to 35 offline consumers on the same product brand. This online consumer voice was a new kind of customer 
relationship management (Wang 2016). The research question is how OPRs can influence the decision to buy products 
with the same brand for online and offline consumers. The next research question is whether OPRs based on positive

5. Conclusion 
This study shows that OPRs can influence consumer decisions in buying Muslim clothing products, both online and 
offline. This study is consistent with research conducted by (Constantinides and Holleschovsky 2016; Helversen et al. 
2018; Ketelaar et al. 2015). This study also proves that OPRs are a collection of information directly from consumers 
about opinions after using the product, as well as information that replaces the stage of extracting consumer voices in 
the product development cycle. This study corroborates the idea of previous research that uses OPRs as a supporter of 
consumer voices (Wang 2016; Xiao et al. 2017; Willemsen et al. 2012; Ireland and Liu 2018). 
 
In this study, it turns out that from the designer side, distrust of OPRs is caused by no objective review, the involvement 
of robotics systems in OPRs that are not purely the voice of consumers. This is consistent with the previous theory, 
which says that there is a possibility of OPRs being hijacked by computer systems or robots. However, OPRs, as part 
of big data technology, are very influential on consumers and business systems in general. This is according to the 
previous theory delivered by (Racherla et al. 2012; Mo et al. 2015; Chong et al. 2016; Folse et al. 2016). 
 
OPRs can influence business processes, become a tool to attract markets, and influence consumers as a tool to compete 
with each other writing reviews. If it aims to bring down, competitors write negative reviews on the e-commerce 
platform. This is in line with the theories conveyed by (Perera et al. 2018; Cooper 2018; Nurcahyanie et al. 2020). 
Future research can use big data analysis with specific algorithms that indicate the suitability of consumer needs and 
the interests of designers.

Abstract 
 
The goal of the study is to categorize the goods and services requested from a ship in an Indonesian shipping company 
into four quadrants using Kraljic Portfolio Model. Currently, the company groups the goods and services 
(commodities) based on its critical nature and functionality. However, current grouping does not signify the purchasing 
strategy when the company wants to acquire each commodity. In this study, the commodity scores for their supply 
risk and potential profit impact are determined using Fuzzy multi-attributes. Three procurement experts in the 
company are involved in scoring the supply risk and profit impact attributes and a total of seven respondents score a 
list of group commodities, and the results are used to find out the performance scores with respect to supply risk and 
profit impact dimensions. The group commodities are then placed in the Kraljic’s Portfolio Model with 
multidimensional scaling. The results reveal that crane parts, generator parts and rigging, mooring, and lifting 
equipment are strategic items, item bunker fuel oil and lube oil is leverage items, valves, pump parts, etc. are bottleneck 
items, and non-critical items are stationary, and food provision. The categorizing will help the company to make a 
proper type of relationship with the supplier so the procurement process can be more reliable.

Introduction 
An Indonesian Shipping Company procures a huge number and assorted variety of products and services for their 
ships to meet their operational obligations. Procurement activities pose risks for the company as they involve company 
resources (time and money). Therefore, purchasing strategies have a big influence on the organization’s overall 
performance. 
 
Kraljic in 1983 introduced a portfolio to help firms in deciding their supply strategy which depends on profit impact 
and supply risk (Kraljic 1983). The portfolio proposes four categories of items: strategic, leverage, bottleneck, and 
non-critical items. Each of the categories needs a different approach to the suppliers. 
 
Kraljic recognizes purchasing as an essential issue in management and it clearly differentiates among various 
purchasing situations and gives sensible suggestions as to how to act (Dubois and Pedersen 2002). Kraljic’s portfolio 
model (KPM) becomes the dominant approach (Croom 1998). Many organizations from different sectors use Kraljic’s 
matrix as their foundation for the purchasing strategy (Lamming and Harrison 2001). 
 
The goal of this study is to determine supplier segmentation for the company using the KPM by employing a fuzzy 
multi-attribute decision-making approach. The supply risk and profit impact dimensions, and the classification in the 
KPM are determined using a multidimensional continuous scale (MDS) of -1 to +1. The segmentation will make the 
procurement process become more reliable. This study is expected to provide recommendations on the most suitable 
supply strategy for each item, and hence help the company to improve its overall performance. 
 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the relevant literature review, while Section 3 
discusses the methodology, Section 4 presents findings and discussions, and Section 5 explains the conclusions of the 
research.

Figure 3. Mapping of the 20 group commodities in the quadrants of the KPM. 
 
Strategic items. This quadrant has the main characteristics of high supply risk and high-profit impact. The group 
commodities included in this category are crane parts, generator parts, and rigging, mooring & lifting equipment. 
From the dimension of supply risk, these group commodities are difficult to obtain in the market because of the specific 
specifications needed. The suppliers are specialized in supplying the product, not general suppliers or retailers, which 
we can get quickly in the market. The company so far often have complaints, especially on the difficulty of getting 
the right goods. The impact of profit on company efficiency is reasonably high due to the direct effect on the ship's 
performance. The reliability of the ship at work is also very dependent on these three groups of goods. Hence, the 
suitable strategy for commodities in this quadrant (strategic items) is building a strategic partnership. 
 
Leverage item. This quadrant has the main characteristics of low supply risk and high-profit impact. Group 
commodities in this quadrant are bunker fuel oil and lube oil & grease. From the dimension of supply risk, these group 
commodities are readily available on the market. The company so far has no complaints about the timeliness, 
availability of supplies, or the quality of the goods. There are particular standards or specifications for this group 
commodities; however, because each supplier can supply as per specification, then it can be said that the complexity 
is very low. The impact of profit on company efficiency is quite high because of the price and quantity purchased are 
relatively high. For these leverage items, the proper strategy is to exploit buying power; however, the groups 
commodities can be moved to strategic items if the company held a strategic partnership with the vendor to get a better 
price and steadfast commitment. 
 
Bottleneck item. This quadrant has the main characteristics of high supply risk but low-profit impacts. Items included 
in this category are Valves, Pump Parts, LSA & FFA, PPE Safety, Piping, Food Provision, Welding Tools, Electrical 
Stores, Paint, Galleys, Equipment, Hand Tools, Carpenter Stores. The complexity of these group commodities is not 
low because there are particular standards or specifications that must be met. The strategy for commodities in this 
quadrant is to avoid the shortage of goods/materials. Thus, the ship's crew needs to manage the safety stock or the 
number of spare parts. 
 
Non-critical item. This quadrant has the main characteristics of low supply risk and low-profit impact. Group 
commodities in this quadrant are bunker fresh water, household & toiletries items and office stationery. These three 
items are readily available on the market, with various types of suppliers providing them. In the aspect of supplier 
performance risk, the company so far has no complaints either regarding the timeliness, availability of supplies, or the 
quality of the goods. There is no complexity, standardization, or particular specifications regarding these items. The 
strategy for commodities in this quadrant is optimizing inventory levels. 
 
Once the matrix is completed, in-depth discussions are held to validate the framework (Padhi et al. 2011). After the 
analysis of MDS (i.e. obtaining Figure 3), three experts filled a short questionnaire for content validity, asking whether 
the experts are satisﬁed (or not) with the matrix shown in Figure 3, and whether position change of a commodity to 
another quadrant is needed. The paper considering consensus-based decisions through strategic discussions with 
experts which provide in-depth insights (achieved through commodities relocating).

and lifting equipment. Leverage items are bunker fuel oil and lube oil & grease. Bottleneck items are Valves, Pump 
Parts, LSA & FFA, PPE Safety, Piping, Food Provision, Welding Tools, Electrical Stores, Paint, Galleys, Equipment, 
Hand Tools, Carpenter Stores. Non-critical items are bunker fresh water, household & toiletries items and office 
stationery. As most of the group commodities are in bottleneck quadrant. hence managing spare part inventory is 
critical and management should put their attention on the reporting system regarding spare part inventory to avoid 
unnecessary downtime which resulted from the breakdown which occurred because there is no spare part on board. 
This study has limitation. The portfolio may not apprehend all the aspects that are considered vital for buyer–supplier 
relationships from a network perspective.

Introduction 
Usaha Menengah Besar (UMB) of a leathercraft industry has higher efficiency level than Usaha Menengah Kecil 
(UMK), based on three levels of efficiency which are low, medium, and high. With that number of percentages of 
UMB, the high level of efficiency business, which is 71.72%, is more than the low level of efficiency business, which 
is 70.21%, and the medium level of efficiency business, which is 67.82%. Unlike UMK, the low level of efficiency 
business, which is 7.79%, is more than the high level of efficiency business, which is 7.79%, and the medium level of 
efficiency business which is 0.75%. Business entities consist of Limited Company PT, CV, Firm, Coop, Foundation, 
Business Permit, and Company Representatives (Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) 2016). 
 
In terms of increasing the efficiency of a business, it needs the assessment of innovation in order to increase the 
business value toward efficiency. Therefore, Central Bureau of Statistics of Indonesia shows the percentage of UMB 
in terms of doing innovation from some sectors which are innovation from products, process, marketing, and 
organization. The percentage of UMB with low level of efficiency which has the highest innovation score is product 
innovation with the score is 79.79%, 44.68% for marketing, 41.49% for process, and 24.47% for organization 
innovation.  
 
CV. XYZ Leathercraft is a manufacturing UMB which was founded since 2010 and has been exporting its products 
to 4 Asian countries and now manufacturing leathercrafts that focuses on product and marketing innovation. At current 
condition, in doing leathercraft manufacturing process, CV. XYZ Leathercraft has not done much on innovation of 
efficiency, such as still implementing 40% outsourcing personnels in its operations, which is almost equal to the total 
number of its employees.

● Knowledge sharing process can be done more effectively. Previously, it was done through the tacit knowledge, 
with KMS it can be done more interactively on the system. 
● KMS can create knowledge sharing culture. Previously, knowledge sharing was only done by meetings, with this 
system through the feature of forums and discussions, the culture of knowledge sharing can be done any time. 
● With KMS, the employees at CV. XYZ Leathercraft can obtain the completed and updated knowledge from 
documents that have been arranged well through the library feature. Previously, the knowledge in documents was 
often incomplete because there was not a neat storage media.

Abstract 
 
Combined optimization between the production and distribution side of electricity must be done because electricity 
produced must be sent directly to the customer. Electricity cannot be saved so it must be produced as much as Demand. 
For this reason, the production system must consider losses in the network, where there are two types of losses, namely 
transmission losses and distribution losses. Power plant scheduling using economic dispatch does not present 
combined optimization. Therefore, this research has produced a Multi Echelon Economic Dispatch (MED) model. 
This model is able to make a combined optimization between the production and distribution/shipping sides. Not only 
that, this model has also divided shipments into two parts, transmission and distribution, so that more detailed 
production scheduling and electricity delivery can be obtained while minimizing fuel costs.

1. Introduction 
Electricity production and distribution are two separate systems. Electricity production is carried out in a group of 
power plants, while electricity distribution is carried out through a transmission and distribution network. Each power 
plant involved in production has its own characteristics. These characteristics lead to differences in fuel use and the 
resulting emissions (Gani et al. 2019). This is the reason the importance of interconnected generator scheduling is 
done well, errors in scheduling cause wasteful use of fuel. 
 
Scheduling of interconnected power plants can be with the economic dispatch model (Jadoun et al. 2015). This model 
is capable of scheduling the entire power plant so that the minimum total cost is obtained as in (Meng et al. 2016; 
Arriagada et al. 2016; Bhattacharjee and Khan 2018; Mahdi et al. 2018). However, this model only optimizes the 
production side. Optimization on the distribution side has not been done. 
 
The combined optimization of production and distribution is carried out using the Transportation Economic Dispatch 
model (Wahyuda et al. 2019). This model is able to carry out production escort at the power plant while synchronizing 
with the shipping network to obtain a minimum total cost. However, this model only considers one delivery echelon. 
So, it is assumed that after production is carried out to the power plant, electricity is directly sent to the final customer 
(Gani et al. 2019). In fact, electricity generated by interconnected plants must go through a transmission and then 
distribution network, where the two networks have different characters.  
 
Therefore, this study proposes a Multi Echelon Economic Dispatch model. This model is a combination of the 
economic dispatch model for the production side and the multi echelon distribution model for the distribution side. 
This model divides electricity delivery into two levels, transmission and distribution networks. This model is able to 
make better power plant scheduling and more detailed distribution.

With demand at six distribution stations of 290 MW (DS1 = 50 MW, DS2 = 80 MW, DS3 = 10 MW, DS4 = 40 MW, 
DS5 = 50 MM, and DS6 = 60 MW) the results for the scenario: 
● Scenario 1: Total production of 343.5 MW, where the excess production of 53.5 MW is produced to cover 
losses on the transmission network (transmission losses = 30.07 MW, distribution losses = 23.41 MW). The 
cost of fuel needed is IDR 441,500,268 and the resulting emissions are 183.1 kg.  
● Scenario 2: Total production of 351.4 MW, where the excess production of 61.4 MW is produced to cover 
losses on the transmission network (transmission losses = 36.19 MW, distribution losses = 25.22 MW). The 
cost of fuel needed is IDR 759,991,251 and the resulting emissions are 131.8 kg. 
● Scenario 3: Total production of 339.0 MW, where the excess production of 49.0 MW is produced to cover 
losses on the transmission network (transmission losses = 26.49 MW, distribution losses = 22.55 MW). The 
cost of fuel needed is IDR 487,159,194 and the resulting emissions are 162 kg.  
 
There is a cost increase of 80% between scenario 1 versus 2. This cost is compensation for losses that fell from 183.10 
kg in scenario 1 to 131.76 kg in scenario 2. Minimizing losses can also reduce emissions as seen in scenario 3. Losses 
can decrease from 53.48 MW in scenario 1 to 49.04 MW in scenario 3, but scenario 3 results in a cost increase of 
10%.   
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
6.1 . Conclusion 
The Multi echelon Economic Dispatch (MED) model has succeeded in making a combined optimization between the 
production and distribution sides of electricity. Optimization on the production side is in the form of scheduling power 
plants while optimization on the distribution side is minimizing electricity mileage. Not only that, this model is also 
able to present electricity production and distribution in more detail. Electricity that reaches the customer can be 
known from the origin of the plant. And also, the losses incurred by each plant to send electricity to the customer can 
be known with certainty, where this advantage is not shared by the classic economic dispatch model.  
 
Another benefit of this model can be used for incentive programs for environmentally friendly power plants. This is 
because minimizing costs at power plants will tend to use low-cost, high-emission power plants, low-emission power 
plants with more expensive costs will not be selected and cannot compete with plants that are not environmentally 
friendly. 
6.2 . Future Research 
Costs and emissions in this study are nonlinear, causing complexity in modelling and computing. Therefore, the initial 
MED model was designed for single objective cases, further research is needed to develop the MED model with multi 
objective cases.

Abstract 
This paper discus a facility layout design in an amusement arcade in Surabaya. In this arcade, there are many idle 
game machines, since the customers only play in certain games. This problem is difficult to resolve since playing 
patterns and game categories have not been acknowledged. Business intelligence are used to analyze play patterns 
so that the game machines layout could be proposed. The proposed layout of game machines also applies the 
concept of store’s layout. The purpose of this study is to propose game machine layout considering the playing 
patterns and categories. The results of this study are to develop a new layout design with considering age. The 
new layout design is to juxtapose the game machine which has the biggest revenue in a category with game 
machine which has the smallest revenue from other categories. These juxtapositions do not cost any money 
because they are done during working hours and using manpower. The proposed layout attracts customers spend 
their money to play.

Introduction 
Traditionally, the main objective of facility layout problem is to minimize the total material flow cost. Facilities 
layout design refers to the arrangement of all equipment, machinery and furnishings within a building envelope 
after considering various objectives of the facility (Riedel 2011). Facility layout problems are found in several 
types of manufacturing systems or plants which affect to system performance (Drira et al 2006). Many researches 
have been done in facility layout problems. De Carlo et al (2013) doing the layout re-arrangement of fashion 
production lines. In this work de Carlo et al, used the value stream mapping approach, to obtain a new facility 
layout. Mowrey et al. (2018) constructed a model to optimize the rack layout in a retail store. They tracked the 
customer behaviour for designing a new layout. Some layout problems with considering adjacencies or shape 
irregularities in manufacturing have been solved (Wang et al 2005; Neghabi and Ghassemi 2016). Garcia et al. 
(2018) proposed the use of simulation based optimization to design a facility layout that has an uncertainty 
associated with new production processes. While a multi objective genetic algorithm for the facility layout 
problem is developed by Aiello et al. (2012). 
 
The use of facility layout is spreading in many businesses. In the service industry, such as museum, theme parks, 
exhibition, and an amusement arcade facility layout problem become more complex when there are a lot of 
visitors’ number among the enterprise’s entities. The visitor crowding gives the negative impacts to visitor 
satisfaction (Rathnayake  2015). Some researches related to reducing crowding and improving satisfaction have 
been proposed (Jaén et al 2011; Kawamura 2004). Yu et al. (2010) tried to solve the museum visitor routing 
problem. Zhang et al. (2017) mentioned that visitor movement is influenced by attraction attributes (e.g., attraction 
type, experience value, facility capacity, floor area, and indoor feature) and spatial layout attributes (e.g., distance 
between attractions, path network, entrance location, and attraction distribution), the relationships between theme 
park visitors traffics and service facility location along with their capacities are found out. The results indicate 
that there is a unique relationship between the service facility placements and the amount of predicted traffic flows 
for each Disneyland (Hoon et al 2016). Block layout approach for attraction based enterprises such as theme parks, 
museums, casinos and exhibitions is proposed by Li and Smith (2018). 
 
The use of marketing analysis in business problems are begin to develop. Dedić and Stanier (2016) stated, business 
intelligence consists of strategies and technologies used by enterprises for analyzing data of business information. 
So, by using business intelligence, we first mining the data to get the customer’s behaviour. We then used the 
information of their habits to layout the facilities in an amusement arcade. In a Cutter Consortium Report (Herzum 
2003) stated 70 percent of the respondents (142 companies) had implemented data warehousing and Business

4. Conclusion 
Designing an amusement Arcade layout is one of the important thing to increasing the customers. The associated 
an amusement arcade layout problem is people only tend to play in certain games. It impacts many rarely played 
game machines are to be idle. We present an alternative layout based on the play pattern with consideration of the 
store layout theory, adopting the entrance sensational theory, and the basis of Power BI. An alternative layout is 
designed by its category and age group. The Games are categorized into three clusters (teenagers, toddlers, both 
of them). The result shows 7 of 12 game categories mostly played by teenagers and only 1 game category played 
by toddlers. The proposed layout gives the more advantages in terms of revenues, the customer attractiveness, and  
safety reason.

Abstract 
Most of large-scaled manufacturing company deals with more than fifties suppliers, which are located within the 
country and abroad. It is also challenging to manage once each partner has different characteristics. Thus, a proper 
supplier relationship management (SRM) program is needed. Most of the company has gathered huge number of data; 
however, they rarely process it optimally. It drives to a longer time consumed to determine strategic decisions making. 
On the other hand, the business competition is very dynamic. As consequences new approach to utilise the big data is 
highly demanded. Data analytic provides a solution to manage the SRM in easier, more efficient, and effective way. 
This research aims to implement data analytics on managing manufacturer and strategic partners relationship, which 
accommodates supplier performance criteria and its dynamic behaviours. It also considers both from theoretical 
definition and practical implications. The analysis uses basis consideration of activities within the SRM. It follows 
Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. One data clustering tool is applied to 
determine supplier classification and further decision. In the end, this study finds that by using relevant data sources, 
data analytic successfully shows a more comprehensive analysis on SRM activities in manufacturing company.

1. Research Background 
Currently, modern industry is experiencing a rapid and dynamic competition. It drives manufacturing companies to 
provide high quality products with affordable price and shorter lead time. As mentioned in Verma (2019), it is almost 
desired of every company to deliver customer delight, i.e. efficiency and effectiveness and hence what customer wants 
over and above the products become an important aspect. It also related to how they manage the system components, 
as well as the stakeholders along the supply chain. The chain consists of supplier, distributor or wholesaler, and its 
customers. Based on the discussion with some production managers, it is known that supplier contribution takes 70% 
portion of the whole process. They stated that the quality of the products mainly derived by the raw materials supplied 
by their supply partners. Thus, the relationship between the company and its suppliers becomes very critical and should 
be handled properly. 
 
Large-scaled manufacturing company mostly carries more than fifties or hundreds of suppliers out, which are placed 
within the country and abroad. A higher number of partners involved also increase the difficulties on managing 
manufacturer-supplier relations that is including supplier selection and performance evaluation. There are several 
steps on partner selection process, such as preparation, sample creation and complete assessment. Once passed all 
these steps, the candidate supplier allowed to do mass production according to the order quantity. Moreover, the 
suppliers will be periodically managed through set of training, inspection, and evaluation. In terms of supplier 
performance, the accomplishment mostly being evaluated in every month with the target of 99.5% (IQC 2017). It 
follows the criteria of evaluation such as incoming rejection, in-process failure, special used parts, lot received and 
demerit of the non-responded claim. The attainment may be varying amongst suppliers, and the corrective action will 
be developed by then. Some companies gathered many data of their supplier, but probably they still need longer time

The Sum of Squared Error (SSE) represents the difference between data within the cluster and the mean of the cluster. 
Based on the reference, the smaller the SSE value means the better clustering result. According to elbow method, the 
optimal number of cluster (k) is the one that has significant descent when the number of clusters is changed. Refers to 
the output in Table 2, it is known that the optimal k equals to 3 for this case study. As illustrated in the Figure 3, the 
data modelling output shows there is a significant slope when the k is changed both from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. To sum 
up, the number of indicators and iterations may affect the silhouette index value and sum of squared error. 
 
Figure 3. Comparison the SSE. 
 
After completing the stages in data modelling, the output provides a clear information about supplier classification by 
considering similar characteristics. The company can use this result for determining further decision on SRM. The 
supplier clusters should help company to define both short and long-term activities, such as monitoring future 
performance, providing incentives or recognition, increasing multiple investment, offering training or assessment, and 
enhancing competition among supply partners. Those are commonly known as supplier development program. 
5. Conclusion and Future Works 
According to the explained result and analysis, this study successfully applied data analytics on managing supplier 
relationship. By using the datasets in a manufacturing company, the modelling output provides an analysis that can be

However, there is still a wide opportunity to improve this research. In terms of theoretical side, future research is 
suggested to accommodates other performance supplier criteria, thus the analysis becomes more comprehensive. The 
other thing that can be improved in the future work is using various number of iterations to have a detail analysis and 
sensitivity in clustering the data.

Abstract.  
The development of information technology has encouraged the emergence of the Online Travel Agent (OTA) in the 
world of travel agent business. The emergence of OTA’s has caused Indonesian people to start using OTA’s to order 
travel products when they are going to travel or vacation. The increasing number of Indonesian people who use OTA’s 
doesn’t guarantee that OTA’s has provided the best service. This is evidenced by the existence of problems and 
complaints that can cause disappointment for OTA’s consumers. Various problems that arise can affect consumers' 
intention to purchase travel products through OTA’s. Therefore, the OTA’s needs to know what factors can encourage 
consumers' intention to purchase travel products through OTA’s, so they can make improvements. The results of data 
processing using the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) method indicate that three factors can influence consumer 
purchase intentions. These factors consist of customer satisfaction, trust, and perceptions of pleasure. Based on this, 
the OTA’s can make improvements to all three factors so that it can encourage the intention to purchase travel products 
through OTA.

Introduction 
The rapid development of information technology makes everything can be done more easily and efficiently. 
Information technology is a combination of computer and telecommunications technology that has information flow 
so fast and dynamically that it demands readiness from all aspects of the industry (Sutabri 2012). The use of 
information technology can cause extraordinary changes in competition, production, marketing, HR management, and 
transactions between companies and consumers. In the field of marketing, information technology causes changes that 
are quite drastic in terms of operations in business by providing opportunities for service providers and consumers 
(Amaro and Duarte 2015). The use of information technology in marketing has become the most effective choice in 
the business world. Various types of businesses in Indonesia have used information technology to market their 
products or services, one of which is in the travel agent business. 
 
According to Standing et al. (2014) in the last few years, travel agents have utilized the development of information 
technology such as the internet to market a variety of products. The emergence of the internet in the world of travel 
agent business encourages the emergence of Online Travel Agents or often called OTAs. OTA is a type of travel agent 
that carries out all its activities through an online process. OTA provides online reservation services that someone 
needs to travel (Antara et al. 2017). In Indonesia, various types of OTA have developed including Tiket.com, 
Traveloka, Agoda, Pegi-Pegi, Booking.com and so on. The emergence of OTA makes it easy for someone who will 
travel or vacation (Terblanche 2015). Because it doesn’t require a lot of time, costs, and energy. Some Indonesian 
people have used OTA to order travel products such as airplane tickets, trains, hotels, and so on. Based on the Online 
Travel Agent survey report conducted by Daily Social it is known that 71.44% of people use OTA for their travel 
needs. 
 
The increasing number of OTA users in Indonesia doesn’t rule out the possibility of OTA related problems. It is known 
that there have been several cases of cyber-attacks in Indonesia that have occurred in OTAs (Aufar et al. 2018). The 
examples of cyber-attack problems that occur are transactions carried out by other parties via credit cards without the

Abstract 
 
The chair has become a fundamental workstation for students around the world. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the causal relationship between chair dimensions, anthropometric measurements, and subjective comfort 
by utilizing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach. Fifty-two senior high school students were recruited to 
evaluate three fixed-type chairs and the anthropometric data were measured. In addition, they were asked to fill the 
subjective comfort questionnaire and rate the chair by utilizing pairwise comparison. SEM revealed that chair 
dimension was found to have a significant on effect on subjective comfort. In addition, anthropometric latent variable 
was also found to have a significant positive effect on subjective comfort. Regarding the indicators, backrest height 
of the chair dimension was found to be a significant predictor for subjective comfort. Finally, stature height, eye 
height, shoulder height, and elbow height of the anthropometric dimensions were found to be significant predictors 
for subjective comfort. This study is one of the first studies that investigated the causal relationships among chair 
dimensions, anthropometric measurements, and subjective comfort simultaneously. The results would be very 
beneficial for academicians, human factors engineers, and even chair manufacturers particularly related to designing 
a good fixed-type chair.

1. Introduction 
Chairs has become a fundamental workstation for students around the world. Nowadays, most universities utilized 
traditional fixed-type chairs due to the price efficiency and the availability on the market compared to the adjustable 
chairs. “Ergo chair” has been a trending topic in 2020 particularly when the chair is compatible with the 
anthropometric data (Underwood and Sims 2019). 
 
Anthropometric data in both school furniture and body dimension is very essential to enhance the user’s comfort and 
safety. The fundamental part of human factors and ergonomics particularly involves systematic measurement of 
human body with regard to product designs (i.e. school furniture). Academicians, human factors engineers and even 
chair manufacturers are actively engaged in chair related research (Underwood and Sims 2019; Yanto et al. 2017;

5. Conclusions 
The chair has become a fundamental workstation for students around the world. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the causal relationship between chair dimensions, anthropometric measurements, and subjective comfort 
by utilizing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach. Fifty-two senior high school students were recruited to 
evaluate three fixed-type chairs and the anthropometric data were measured. In addition, they were asked to fill the 
subjective comfort questionnaire and rate the chair by utilizing pairwise comparison. SEM revealed that chair 
dimension was found to have a significant on effect on subjective comfort. In addition, anthropometric latent variable

of the chair dimension was found to be a significant predictor for subjective comfort. Finally, stature height, eye 
height, shoulder height, and elbow height of the anthropometric dimensions were found to be significant predictors 
for subjective comfort. This study is one of the first studies that investigated the causal relationships among chair 
dimensions, anthropometric measurements, and subjective comfort simultaneously by utilizing SEM. The results 
would be very beneficial for academicians, chair-comfort researchers (Wegner et al. 2020; Fasulo et al. 2019; 
Fazlollahtabar 2010), and even chair manufacturers particularly related to designing a good fixed-type chair.

Abstract 
 
Chicken manure waste resulting from the process of raising broiler chickens has an impact on the surrounding 
community and employees. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), an analysis of the existing chicken breeding process 
with the scope of gate to gate is carried out. There are two outputs of chicken cultivation results, namely broiler 
chickens and non-product in the form of chicken droppings. Based on processing using SimaPro v.9 software with 
IMPACT 2002+ method, the output of chicken manure has the most impact on the environment. The biggest impact 
produced in the form of human health. Through the analysis of the problems, recommendations are given for 
improvement using a sensitivity analysis approach to reduce the impact of chicken farming output. From this research 
we obtained that substituting soybean meal into fish meal and raising 20% as a food raw material are alternatives that 
can reduce the environmental impact. Recommendations for processing chicken manure can use circular economy 
principles i.e. recycle by processing chicken manure into fertilizer. Some other alternatives can sell chicken manure 
directly to the fertilizer industry distributor.

1. Introduction 
Broilers are superior breeds resulting from crossing of several types of chickens that have high productivity, especially 
in producing chicken meat (Nuharja et al. 2018). Indonesia, especially in the field of broiler agroindustry. Statistics 
show that the number of broilers in Indonesia in 2013 was around 1.3 billion (Katalog BPS 2015). The livestock sector 
contributes to the livelihoods of millions of people, but its production raises several environmental challenges such as 
greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, acidification and biodiversity loss (Katalog BPS 2015).  
 
According to attachment I of the regulation of the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia number 31 
regarding guidelines for good broiler farming chapter IV concerning environmental preservation to treat livestock 
waste (Kementerian Pertanian Republik Indonesia 2014). One aspect that has a high enough impact on the environment 
is the waste from the livestock industry. Livestock wastes contain hazardous chemicals such as NH3, which cause 
negative impacts on the environment.  
 
Broiler chicken production starts from the maintenance of chicken seedlings. Chicken maintenance consisting of stages 
of feeding, vaccines, until the chicken is ready to be slaughtered, chicken maintenance takes approximately 40 days. 
To obtain optimal quality broiler chickens, the cages are cleaned and sterilized after the chickens are ready to be sent 
to the Chicken Slaughterhouse. The contents of broiler chicken feed are ingredients that are rich in protein, for example: 
soy flour, turnip flour, fish meal, meat and bone flour, dried distillers grains with solution (DDGS, corn flour from 
ethanol production), minerals, for example: flour bone, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate (N. Metal and N. Science 
2017). Manure produced from the broiler chicken cultivation process is approximately 113 tons.  
 
Waste generated from chicken farming business includes chicken manure, chicken carcasses and liquid waste. Liquid 
waste originating from wastewater from the washing place for feed and drinking poultry and other domestic needs. 
The amount of wastewater is small and is usually absorbed into the soil and has no major effect on the surrounding

1748","composition of soybean meal into fish meal, it can reduce the environmental impact caused by the broiler chicken 
breeding process. Table 4 shows the calculation of SimaPro Software output. 
 
Chicken manure waste treatment is carried out to reduce the impact caused by the process of raising broiler chickens. 
In the waste collection applied by Pratiwi Farm, it is by piling up waste beside the farm. New opportunities for circular 
economy are created by the utilization of waste biomass, such as post extraction residues rich in micronutrient ions, 
such as Cu, Mn, and Zn ions to produce bio-based micronutrient fertilizers (Chojnacka et al. 2020).  
 
The application of animal manure on agricultural land as organic fertilizer to replace mineral fertilizer has been 
considered, taking into account the avoidance of mineral fertilizer production. The use of chicken manure as raw 
material for fertilizer has been widely applied in several farms. Chicken manure waste, which is dumped beside the 
farm, can be reduced by processing its own waste into fertilizer or it can also be sold at several fertilizer processing 
distributors. If chicken manure waste is processed into fertilizer by the owner requires investment of several tools, but 
the economic value will be higher than chicken manure directly sold to distributors. Compost treatment from waste is 
an innovation, in addition to increasing creativity and economy, it also can reduce the impact on the environment. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The broiler chicken farm process produces four categories of damage impacts, namely human health, ecosystem 
quality, climate change and resources. The biggest environmental impact is human health. The cause of damage to the 
human health category was caused by the ammonia content generated from the waste of chicken manure produced. 
These chemical compounds contribute to the decline in the quality of ecosystems and public health. 
 
The most possible alternative to reduce the impact on the ecosystem from chicken farming waste is to replace the 
composition of chicken feed from soybean meal into fish meal. Another alternative to reduce the environmental impact 
can also be done by using chicken manure waste as fertilizer, besides that waste can also be minimized by selling 
chicken manure.

Abstract 
 
Enterprise risk management is one of a firm's strategies to achieve the goals. Meanwhile, the risk monitoring 
committee is a corporate organ evaluating enterprise risk management. However, not many researchers have discussed 
the role of the risk monitoring committee. The previous research paid more attention to the role of the risk management 
committee. The purpose of this study is to identify the role of the risk monitoring committee on the relationship 
between enterprise risk management disclosure and firm value. The role of the risk monitoring committee was viewed 
based on size, independent member, female member, education level, financial expert, risk management expert, and 
meeting. This research was conducted on commercial banks listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange within a period 
of 2016-2018. 126 samples were collected using a purposive sampling technique through observation. The results 
showed that five variables such as committee size, female member, financial expert, risk management expert, and 
meeting moderated the relationship between enterprise risk management disclosure and firm value, yet the committee 
of independent member and education level did not moderate the relationship between enterprise risk management 
disclosure and firm value.

1. Introduction 
The global financial crisis occurring a few years ago raised people’s awareness focusing on risk disclosure practices 
(Schmid et al. 2011). Risk disclosure practices represent the quality of corporate governance practices (Solomon et al. 
2000) to increase firm value (Schmid et al. 2011; Baxter et al. 2013; Nahar et al. 2016). However, not all empirical 
studies can prove the impact of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) on firm value. Some evidence shows that mixed 
results in response to the geographical and industrial restrictions are difficult to generalize previous empirical results 
(Lechner and Gatzert 2016). Therefore, the research on management and firm value, particularly in Indonesia, is 
important and interesting to conduct.  
 
One effort to monitor the ERM process is by establishing a Risk Monitoring Committee. In Indonesia, the National 
Governance Policy Committee has issued a General Guideline for Good Corporate Governance stating that the board 
of commissioners should form a supporting committee called Risk Monitoring Committee (RMC). The new policy is 
only obliged to the banking sector. The regulation on the establishment of a Risk Monitoring Committee on the 
banking sector is also reinforced with the Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 8/4/PBI/2006 concerning Good 
Corporate Governance Implementation by Commercial Banks, and also Financial Services Authority Regulation No. 
55/POJK.03/2016 concerning the Implementation of Governance for Commercial Banks containing corporate 
governance implementation in the banking sector.  
 
In various literature, practitioners and academicians emphasize that the synergy between the corporate governance 
elements is one key element for effective risk disclosure (Viscelli et al. 2016; Beasley et al. 2015). However, there is 
a limited understanding of the role of governance elements in developing ERM practices and their impacts on firm 
value. In addition, although the RMC establishment is greatly important, there is only some evidence discussing the 
role of RMC in the firm value. Most studies only focused their attention on the Risk Management Committee (Schmid 
et al. 2011; Hines and Peters 2015). In practice, risk management in big banks has followed the prescribed regulatory 
pressure, yet only a small number of banks can implement good practices. Although most banks have already had a

*Significance level at α = 5% 
** Significance level at α = 10% 
 
The interaction testing results of ERM disclosure and RMC financial expert showed a positive direction with the 
significance of 0.00, meaning that the RMC financial expert was proven capable of strengthening the relationship 
between ERM disclosure and firm value. The financial expert, at least one person, was able to reduce the risk of 
company failure and made a positive contribution to the shareholder wealth creation. The RMC members with 
financial expertise were expected to improve the ERM reporting quality to increase the firm value. This result 
supported the previous studies that committees with financial expertise would improve the financial reporting quality 
(Magee et al. 2014; Haniffa and Cooke 2005) and ultimately increase the company value. Thus, this result supported 
H6. 
 
The interaction testing results of ERM disclosure and RMC risk management expert showed a positive direction with 
a significance of 0.09, meaning that RMC risk management expert was proven to strengthen the relationship between 
ERM disclosure and firm value at the significance level of α = 10%. Thus, RMC should have the risk management 
knowledge and understanding that RMC might internally and externally identify, assess, and evaluate the possibilities 
arising potential risks in the future. RMC members with risk management expertise might increase the ERM disclosure 
to stakeholders and respond positively. This result supported H7. 
 
The interaction of ERM disclosure and RMC meeting showed a positive direction with the significance of 0.00, 
meaning that the RMC meeting was proven to strengthen the relationship between ERM disclosure and firm value. 
The frequency of RMC meetings reflected the responsibilities of members in performing a monitoring process (Ellul 
and Yerramilli 2010). Risk management was a dynamic and ongoing process that RMC should have a regular and 
consistent frequency of meetings to respond to any risk change. The higher the RMC members’ meeting frequency, 
the more effective the RMC monitored the ERM developments (Malik 2017). This result supported H8. 
 
The results of control variables indicated that ROE and DER respectively had the significance value of 0.93 and 0.79, 
exceeding the limit level of 0.05. This data proved that profitability and leverage did not affect the relationship between 
ERM and firm value. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In recent years, the regulators and investors have paid more attention to the ERM disclosure information. One of the 
government's efforts to have more effective risk control was by establishing the RMC. However, this attention has not 
been followed by the increasing number of studies discussing the topic. At present, not many researchers have 
discussed the role of RMC. The statistical results of this study showed that the effectiveness of ERM disclosure on 
firm value was influenced by the RMC characteristics. This study theoretically supported the literature on corporate 
governance and risk management, particularly in banking industries. This study is also practically expected to provide 
inputs to regulators and company management that a ""strong"" RMC is greatly effective to improve the market 
performance.  
 
This study has two limitations. First, the research was only conducted in the banking sector since the policy to form 
RMC was only required by banks. Since limited by the use of small samples, this topic may become one productive 
area for future research. Further researchers may also evaluate the implementation of ERM and firm value in both 
banking and non-banking companies that the companies which have no RMC will be interested in forming a similar 
committee. Second, the results identified that the average level of ERM disclosure was still low, at 44 percent or still 
below 50 percent which was probably due to the ERM disclosure which was only based on the domestic banking 
regulations. Therefore, researchers may then combine the global ERM model initiated by COSO with the local ERM 
model established by the regulators to produce more comprehensive conclusions.

Abstract 
 
Spare part inventory contributes significantly to the overall inventory cost of the company.  Spare part inventory 
is needed to support the maintenance process in order to maintain the reliability of the production facility.  Quite 
often burden from spare part inventory is getting more severe when users are located in various sites and the users 
wanted higher service levels. This paper addresses the problem of shadow warehouses created by users in order 
to obtain a higher service level. The company currently has 44 shadow warehouses. The aim is to reduce those 
warehouses and then attempt to centralize the control of inventory by using (Min, Max) inventory control model. 
The stock parameters adjustment as per the result of the Min-Max inventory control model will increase the service 
level of criticality B up to 91% and criticality C up to 88%. Hence, the cost reduction of inventory value is USD 
199,644.02 for fast-moving material and USD 43,210.82 for medium moving material.

1. Introduction 
Align to fast and high competition in business nowadays, most businesses are required to have continuous 
improvement and efficiency in all aspects, both technically and commercially. One of the important and critical 
aspects that contributes to the efficiency of the organization is the inventory. Improper stock control or 
underestimating the management of the inventory might lead the company sustainability and production to higher 
risk which possibly interrupts the supply commitment to the customer. Having inventory to fulfill the demand is 
critical, but too much inventory would jeopardize the company due to its inherent high cost. 
 
Inventory has an important role in the company to ensure the operation continuity, inventory planning and control 
shall focus on both demand and supply which shall have an objective in fulfilling demand at competitive cost, 
therefore inventory must be carefully managed and controlled. Purchasing required spare parts and material shall 
have special attention to acquisition cost which will directly impact to company’s finances. There are many papers 
addressed the Min-Max methodology. Kinanthi & Herlina, & Finda (2016) analyze how to control the inventory 
of raw material precisely. Moon and Choi (1994) used the Min–Max distribution free approach to develop a 
continuous-review inventory model with a service level constraint, Gallmann and Valerie (2010) provided how 
best performing companies strive to improve their service levels, Wang consider an inventory control system with 
constraint on the service level. The use of service level constraint is mainly motivated by the difficulty of 
estimating shortage cost. For which the service level concept is viewed as an appealing practical alternative. 
Alessandri Angelo (2011) concern the combination of Min-Max optimization and MPC to solve strategic and 
tactical inventory control problems for the management, meanwhile analysis to anticipate shadow warehouse by 
using Min-Max method was not found. Analysis in this thesis focus on determining optimum inventory parameters 
by using the Min-Max method, and impact analysis of Min-Max method implementation to cost and service level 
achievement. 
 
A warehouse is the storage facility for goods or material required by users to sustain the operation and business 
of the company for creating values and profit. The physical activities inside the warehouse are including receiving, 
binning, picking, and deliver or distribute the material to the user as their request with match quantity and time.

Abstract 
 
In consumer goods business there are two factors that related to the inventory policy. First, there is a permissible 
delay in payments given by the vendor. This delay on payment can be used by the company to make extra profit 
but with a risk of given fine cost if the payments exceed the promised date. Second, there is a possibility of some 
damaged products, which cannot be sold to the customer. The purpose of this research is to develop an inventory 
model considering both the damage factor in product and payments delay. There were previous researches, 
considering payment delay and perishable product, same with damaged product, separately, that were the basis of 
the developed model. The data from the previous models was applied to the developed model and a comparison 
has been made. It can be concluded that the developed model is applicable to obtain optimal order quantity by 
considering damage factor in product and delay in payment. The developed model had also more complete cost 
components, lower order quantity, and higher total inventory cost compared to the previous ones.

1. Introduction 
In manufacturing processes, materials are needed as an input. Manufacturing companies need raw materials to be 
processed, spare parts for maintenance activities, and final product to be sold. These materials should be procured 
and kept as an inventory, to ensure service level, because there are uncertainty and lead time. The inventory itself 
should be kept minimum in order to retain inventory cost as minimum as possible (Bahagia 2006). The trade-off 
between service level and inventory cost is the basic problem of inventory policy. 
 
Company profit, especially in consumer products business, is not only related to the pricing strategy, but also in 
the coordination of inventory policy (Silitonga 2019). There are two factors that could affect a mini market 
business, an example of consumer product business. Referring to the Customer Protection Law in Indonesia, 
damaged products cannot be sold to customer (Sekretariat Negara 1999). This law statement could affect the 
inventory cost as when there are possibilities for the product stored in the warehouse could be damaged or 
depreciated (Bahagia 2006). If the number of inventories stored in warehouse is high, it will increase the 
possibilities to have a greater number of damaged products. If the number of inventories stored are kept low, the 
cost of placing order will increase (Limansyah 2011). Another factor that could affect the inventory cost is the 
permissible delay in payment factor. From the vendor’s perspective, this permissible delay is used to increase 
their product demand (Shinn 2018). Here, the company can purchase a product from a vendor using credit term. 
The vendor will give time before the company must settle the account (Sunendar 2019). This delay in payment 
period can be used to earn some extra profits which will compensate inventory cost. However, if the company 
unable to settle the transaction in the given time, there will be some penalty fee for the company (Goyal 1985). 
Hence, there is a trade-off between minimizing inventory stored to reduce product damage factor and maximizing 
inventory stored to earn maximum extra profit using permissible delay in payments. 
 
Some studies have been done considering each of these factors. Limansyah (2011) did a research on an economic 
order quantity inventory model considering perishable product. In this research, the amount of product perishable 
is computed by using congruence principle. Limanjaya (2018) developed Limansyah (2011) model by using 
probabilistic demand, the amount of perishable product in this research is computed using a percentage. Goyal 
(1985) did a research on economic order quantity by considering delay in payments, however this previous 
research did not considered both of these factors at the same time. Based on the explanation above, the purpose 
of this paper is to develop economic order quantity inventory model by considering damage factor in product and 
permissible delay in payment.

1776","price of perishable product parameter when Limansyah (2011) model is used. Fine cost of the developed model 
is lower than Goyal (1985) model because of the 7 units damaged product in developed model that is discarded. 
Interest revenue between Goyal (1985) and developed model is same as it has the same amount of product price 
value used to generate extra profit. If we see the model on cost component view, developed model has a more 
complete cost component compared to both the previous model (Limansyah 2011; Gayol 1985). Developed model 
that has a lower amount of order quantity than Limansyah (2011) model shows the consideration to the possibility 
of fine cost in permissible delay in payment factor. The higher total inventory cost of the developed model 
compared to Goyal (1985) showed the damage factor influence. Based on this, the developed model is applicable 
in real situation where there is both the damage factor in product and payment delay factors. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this paper, an economic order quantity model considering damage factor in product and permissible delay in 
payments has been developed. The developed model is more applicable in the real situation as it considers both 
the damage factor in product and permissible delay in payments. The model showed lower order quantity and 
higher inventory cost compared to the previous studies. Permissible delay in payment can be used by company to 
earn some extra profit, but the company can also be fined if the product stock has not been sold out. Further 
research can be done by considering other shape of damage product distribution, or using multi item products, or 
by considering a probabilistic demand.

Abstract 
This case study was carried out to determine the economic study of the implementation of the burner unit removal 
project. Three investment alternatives have been developed and compared in this study to determine the most 
economical option, i.e. operational refractory burner system as well as current state (alternative 1), remove unit burner 
to ladle shop building in accordance build a new building in ladle shop building and also modify existing overhead 
crane (alternative 2), remove unit burner to ladle shop building in accordance build a new building in ladle shop 
without modifying overhead crane unit (alternative 3). Economic evaluation is studied by performing cost saving 
analysis, increment cash flow projection, NPV, IRR, and Payback Period. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the 
most economic option was carried out based on three investment parameters which are a projection of the operational 
saving cost, discounted rate, and cost of investment changes. The result shows that alternative 2 have the highest NPV, 
IRR, and Payback period has slightly lowest than alternative 3. In term of sensitivity analysis, alternative 2 have a big 
tolerance to the all of investment parameter. Therefore, this study has been successfully confirmed that alternative 2 
is the most economical option.

Introduction 
Nickel material is one of the main components of the electric battery which is projected to immediately replace fossil 
fuels. It will become the emergence of more nickel material processing companies, especially in Indonesia as one of 
the biggest nickels producing countries in the world. Nickel material commodity is one of the commodities that have 
price volatility, it is influencing by various global factors. Economic factors play a major role in the sustainability of 
a production process and improvement of production systems (Couper 2003). This encourages nickel material 
processing companies to improve operational and maintenance cost efficiency to survive with these conditions. In the 
last few years, XYZ has implemented cost efficiency programs in all departments, to achieve operational and 
maintenance cost-efficiency. 
 
The refractory work unit is one of the units owned by the operation and maintenance department of PT. XYZ which 
has the main task of keeping all production equipment operating at high temperatures well protected. The Unit burner 
has a function as a combustion device of processing refractory material to raise high-temperature services as an 
operational necessity, especially in kiln and furnace. 
 
Presently, the processing refractory material was carried out by 2 different locations, which are Ladle Shop and Heavy-
duty Shop. Demolition and castable work were carried out in a ladle shop. Meanwhile, the refractory combustion 
process is carried out in a heavy-duty shop. It causes inefficient works process and also impacted to the operating 
budget, especially in cost of mobilization. In 2019, the total annual operational budget of the refractory burner work 
unit is $382,100.00 and it tends to increase 2.82% every year. The annual operational budget of the refractory burner 
unit from 2010 - 2019 can be seen in Figure 1 below.

1. Introduction 
Inventory is one of the critical aspects of a company. In the case of inventories for supplies, materials, or parts of 
production machines, the availability of replacement parts to support maintenance activities becomes a core issue that 
affects the equipment efficiency of typical process industries. The requirement to manage the spare part inventory, 
also called maintenance inventory (Eloff and Carstens 2013), even challenging due to some situations e.g. the demand 
comes in stochastics manner as the nature of breakdown machines, items have superbly long lead time of procurement. 
Over the decades, many scholars put great attention to optimize spare parts inventory, include Kurniati et al (Kurniati 
et al. 2013), who tried to combined maintenance policy and the consequences of spare part inventory policy. For a 
typical process industry, spare parts are divided into two categories i.e. routine (consumables) and non-routine spare 
parts. Routine spare parts refer to parts or material consumed for machine operations e.g. oil lubricants, cleaning fluid, 
bag cloth. Any user or department in a company could request it. While non-routine spare parts mean parts needed to 
support equipment maintenance, the purchase requests could be filed by either mechanical, electrical, or 
instrumentation unit.  
 
As a potential problem reveals in stock, the spare part inventory may also experience either over-stock and under-
stock. These two situations happen considering both demand and the number of stocks. A typical Min-Max method is 
usually applied for practical reasons. The average of historical demand becomes Min stock (also referred to as the 
reorder point), while the Max stock is calculated as 70% above the average. However, the spare part availability 
doesn’t fulfill the requirement of maintenance, longer downtime due to waiting for the spare part cause considered 
production losses. Raw Mill, the main equipment of cement production has experienced failure. Since bearing was 
stock out, persuade the company to follow procedures at Director level approval to command access form another 
plant. The losses were equivalent to US$ 1.65 million.  
 
Considering more on the causes of downtime, for two years of operations, there are around 12% of downtime, about 
37% of it due to stock out. Therefore, it is quite a big challenge for the maintenance unit to maintain the equipment 
ready to meet the production. Moreover, from the warehouse side, the inventory value was increased significantly for

4.7. The Comparisons Amongst Inventory Methods  
The overall analysis using four methods into the first ten critical non-routine spare parts with a lumpy pattern is 
provided in Table 3. In general, it can be seen the three inventory methods that are examined to the spare parts provide 
better performance compared to the existing min-max method employed in the typical continuous process industry. 
The higher service level and the lower inventory cost demonstrated by the three proposed methods, even there are no 
always dominant methods in all cases. The reliability approach used to infer the inventory spare part management 
seems to perform better even compare to the common inventory model for any goods, continuous and periodic review 
methods. This reasonable due to more careful attention to the demand related to the characteristics of spare parts. The 
spare part demand was triggered by the failure equipment required replacement action. The failure randomly happened 
related to the aging and deterioration characteristics of production equipment which are considered as a stochastic 
event. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study of several inventory methods examination for spare parts inventory has been conducted for a 
typical process industry i.e. cement company. For that industry, the production process runs continuously under 
expectation without or minimum downtime may cause some extremely high cost or opportunity lost. Therefore, the 
availability of spare parts in the warehouse is important to handle, as well as to keep the warehouse performance 
indicator achieved.  The classification of spare parts helps management to focus on very critical items. Amongst 465 
non-routine spare parts in the company, category A, B, and C are 4.09%, 13.33%, 82.58% respectively. Based on 
ADI-CV analysis, around 97% displays the lumpy pattern.  Based on the examination of three inventory methods to 
the non-routine spare parts, it is found that the reliability-based methods provide better performance compared to the 
continuous and periodic review methods, more significant even compare to the existing min-max method. The possible 
reasons for this situation due to careful attention to the demand spare part, which is considered as the optimal 
replacement policy that was calculated first. This will keep the spare parts requirement consider the reliability 
characteristics of equipment where the spare parts equipped. The reliability-based method taking into account the 
reliability factor, lead time, standard deviation of demand, continuously checking items with a fixed number of orders, 
and the desired target service level at the beginning of the calculation, which it does not yet have in the existing 
method. 
 
There is a possibility of some management adjustments may be required to determine the inventory policy following 
the reliability-based inventory methods. The continuous examination of the spare parts stock ensures updated 
information towards uncertain demand for replacement.

Abstract 
 
Food is one of the basic human needs. Government has set strategic commodity targets, one of which is corn and 
chicken. Corn is an important agricultural commodity for humans and livestock. There is a challenge where the 
increase in corn production is going slow so far. As a result, the speed of increasing demand for corn cannot be pursued 
to increase production. This also has an impact on chicken farmers which have a mutualism symbiotic with corn 
farmers. The selling price of corn and the right price of fodder will produce the right price of chicken and chicken 
eggs. This condition will have an impact to the welfare of corn and chicken farmers. This study aims to project the 
adequacy of corn both for humans and fodder by concerning the welfare of corn farmers and chicken farmers with 
parameters of corn and fodder prices. An approach with a dynamic system simulation is carried out to achieve a 
balance between the welfare of corn farmers and chicken farmers to be able to maintain their future existence based 
on corn prices and fodder prices. This approach is used because of the ability of this model to solve complex system 
behaviour between variables.

1. Introduction 
Food is one of the basic human needs which should be fulfilled at all the times, so that food acquisition can be said to 
be one of human rights (FAO 1996). Moreover, food is a basic component to realize quality human resources (Panikkai 
et al. 2017). Following this up, the certainty of the availability of consistent and regular food is very important for 
food security (Namany 2020). Food security is a multi-dimensional and dynamic concept that requires interconnected 
entities including producers, customers and policy makers to work together in a well-organized and fully functional 
service-oriented supply chain (FAO 1996). Thus, to achieve food security, the food sector strives to ensure the 
sustainability and efficiency of food production (Moragues 2017). Through sustained food production, food 
availability will become more certain. 
 
However, the achievement of food availability has several obstacles, such as uncertainty and risks governing food 
production and supply, including natural disasters, unstable international trade policies and political conflicts (Namany 
2020). To overcome these obstacles, policymakers make food insecurity the main concern at various scales which 
requires global action on how to deal with it (Kpienbaareh and Luginaah 2019). One of them is related to the 
productivity of the food system so that food production does not only offset population growth but also increases food 
security in many areas (Vermeulen et al. 2013). So that, as a country with the fourth highest population in the world, 
Indonesia is always trying to reduce food insecurity in many areas starting from the provincial, district and sub-district 
levels (Panikkai et al. 2017). Therefore, food security becomes an important concern for the government, not only in 
its fulfilment, but also for the right price so that it can be affordable for the community. Food production can be 
affected which leads to higher prices whenever commodities become more scarce (Wheeler and Von 2013). 
Furthermore, the availability of food should be supported by food providers, those who produce food to maintain their 
welfare, so that they can produce food in a sustainable manner. 
 
In order to realize sustainable food security, the government sets strategic commodity targets, namely staple food 
which gets top priority in achieving food self-sufficiency (Development AR and Strategic Food Outlook 2015). The

1797","3.4. Simulation Result  
The simulation was carried out with a monthly period for the next 12 months, namely for 2020. The results of the 
simulation were emphasized on the adequacy of corn to meet the fodder stock, then chicken stock and chicken eggs 
stock for 12 months. Furthermore, the welfare of farmers also be concerned because the number of farmers support 
the availability of the commodities. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Number of farmers. 
 
Figure 3 is one of the simulation results, namely for the number of farmers in the next 12 months. Corn farmers number 
trends to decrease, and finally in December corn farmers will projected to reach 37,940 people. Corn farmers number 
is positively related to the cost of corn production and the corn selling price at the farm level. If the net income of 
farmers decreases, the number of corn farmers will decrease. In the same case, chicken farmers and laying hens farmers 
also tend to decrease. In December, the chicken farmers number became 12,020 people and 696 people for laying hen 
farmers. This also relates to the income received by farmers. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this research, modelling was designed with causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams. Both causal loop 
diagrams and stock flow diagrams consist of four sub-models. The implication of this research is the resulting model 
can be used for the East Java government to carry out its food security policy by ensuring the availability of corn as 
one of the achievement pillars of food security. The policy includes giving instructions to plant corn commodities, at 
least once a year. Therefore, food stability may also be achieved. In addition, the government can also use the unused 
land to plant corn and increase corn productivity by implementing a tight spacing system on corn plants in order to 
increase the corn production.  
 
Meanwhile, other regional governments that produce large corn, such as Central Java, South Sulawesi, and regions 
that have quite large chicken farmers such as West Java, Central Java, Banten, and North Sumatra can meet the needs 
of fodder by setting the prices affordable. Thus, this can also encourage the existence of farmers to maintain stable 
production of chicken and chicken eggs at affordable prices. However, the underlying weakness of this research, 
emerges in the aspect of parameter assessment of welfare. The corn farmers’ welfare was assessed based on merely 
the selling price of corn and based on the purchase price of fodder for chicken farmers’ welfare. In the future it is 
necessary to assess the welfare indicators more broadly, not only from income. One of them is the approach to 
understanding human development. In addition, other strategic commodities e.g. soybean as the main source of protein 
might also be an option for future research.

Abstract 
 
The present study reviews previous studies that discuss the influence of brand image, halal status, and certification on 
consumers’ purchasing decision. From the many existing studies on the influence of dimensions in research decisions, 
we selected ten studies to find out the factors that influence purchasing decisions. From several purchasing decision 
factors, the study focuses on research review on brand image, halal status, and product certification factors. We also 
review what dimensions are used in each of these factor assessments in addition to the research methods used in the 
study of the influence of a brand image, halal, and product certification on purchasing decisions. The results showed 
that brand image, halal status, and government certification have a significant influence on purchasing decisions. The 
dimensions used to investigate brand image variable encompass attributes, benefits, and attitudes. Halal variable 
incorporates the use of various dimensions in the studies examined such as marketing, customer awareness, and 
labeling. Finally, one of the dimension used in the government certification variable is the attitude towards quality 
labels.

1. Introduction  
Food and beverages are basic human needs. Accompanied by rapid technological developments, food and beverage 
products are exceedingly available and convenient for consumptions. Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang 
Kartasasmita, explained that manufacturing industry sector is the cornerstone of Indonesian economy by becoming 
the largest contributor to gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. The biggest contributor to this sector is the food and 
beverage industry which grew 6.50%. In the third quarter of 2019, there were five industries that achieved the highest 
growth value, namely the textile and apparel industry with growth of 15.08%, the repair service industry and machine 
installation with 10.33% growth, and the food and beverage industry with 8.33% growth. This culmination give rise 
to the increase in the number of food and beverage industry, triggering fierce competitions.  
 
On the onset of fierce competitions, a party in the food and beverage industry must possess an advantage in the eyes 
of consumers to attract their purchasing decisions upon their products. Consumers sentiments in deciding the purchase 
of a desired product or service are ever changing and continuously develop on the basis of intelligence, efficiency, 
and effectiveness (Karimi et al. 2015). Moreover, each consumer has unique considerations or factors in determining 
the purchase of a product. Four distinct factors play role in setting the motions of a purchasing decision, namely 
cultural, social, personal and psychological factors (Kotler 2003). 
 
There are many elements that can influence consumers in their decision to make a purchase. Among many, there are 
factors such as brand image, halal label, price, government certification, nutrition, place of production location, etc. 
As such, a food and beverage company must know what factors that can utilize and control to create a significant and 
positive effect on purchasing decisions towards their products. Through this a company will be able to apply the right 
strategy to attract consumers and become superior among the industry.

The results showed that, in practice, awareness of halal products affects the 
interest of the public purchasing on halal products over the products (cake) 
that have not been certified halal. Identity is significantly influential towards 
the halal awareness, while the religiosity and label halal assurance not impact

3.4. Government Certification 
Government certification can include conformations to both national and international standards. Internationally there 
is ISO 22000 certification on food safety, which consists of a management system, food safety hazard control and so 
forth. Indonesia alone has a regulation of itsown , ie Standar Nasional Indonesia (SNI). Standar Nasional Indonesia 
(SNI) is the only standard that exists in Indonesia. SNI is formulated by the Technical Committee and approved by 
the Badan Standar Nasional (BSN). SNI development process consists of planning, formulation, and maintenance of 
SNI. The Technical Committee prepares and proposes the SNI formulation program to BSN, as well as implementing 
and maintaining SNI. According to Herjanto, the application of SNI is voluntary, but the government may be able to 
impose certain SNI compulsorily for reasons related to the protection ofpublic interest, national security, national 
economic development and preservation of environmental functions (Herjanto 2011). The following Table 4 is a

4. Conclusion 
In the present journal review journal on ""the effect of brand image, halal status, and government certification on 
purchasing decisions"" factors that influence each variable are found: 
• Purchasing decision factors that with recognizable influence include brand image, halal, and price, certification, 
nutritional value, and production processing plants, store image, safety, comfort, environment, and quality, 
cleanliness and food. 
• The brand image variable that influence purchasing decisions consists of attribute (smell, taste, service, quality, 
price, reputation, social environment, comfort, etc.), attitude (trust, brand perception, brand awareness, etc.), 
benefit (health, environmentally friendly, etc.) dimensions category. 
• The halal variable factor that influence purchasing decisions in food as well as halal-certified cosmetic products 
purchases is dependable upon marketing, customer awareness, labeling, trust in the elements of labeling, 
personal religiosity, consumer attitudes, and supermarket locations. 
• The government certification factor that influence purchasing decisions in buying government or SNI certified 
food and beverages are affected by behavioral control, subjective norms, quality label awareness, image quality 
labels, perceived quality of label products, attitudes towards label quality, intention to use quality labels, colors

government or SNI certified products are the low level of consumer awareness and knowledge on the 
certification system, inadequate promotion, and low availability of certified products. Therefore, socialization 
on the benefits of the application of SNI to the public is required, especially in the business sector.

Abstract 
 
Infrastructure in Indonesia is currently still considered low, both in terms of quality and quantity when compared to 
other countries, especially in Southeast Asia, where the availability of infrastructure is a condition for a region to 
change the potential of the region into economic benefits for its people. Realizing this, the government is currently 
trying to increase the availability of infrastructure in all sectors needed to leverage the national economy. In fulfilling 
infrastructure needs to increase the added value of a region's potential to regional income, it is influenced by several 
important variables that need to be considered by policy makers in developing infrastructure financing strategies. This 
research aims to see and measure the impact of infrastructure development on economic growth by taking a case study 
in Lumajang Regency, East Java Province. Lumajang Regency was chosen as the object of research considering the 
region's GRDP growth is quite high while its economic growth is low. The Dynamic System Method is used in the 
hope that it can see the issue of infrastructure development as a whole both based on its impact and its linkages with 
other sectors. With the ability to simulate simultaneously, obtained the role of sectors that contribute to the added 
value of the construction sector with a proportion of 45.7% followed by the transportation and communication sector 
at 33.2% in second place, and the agricultural sector ranked 3rd with a score of 15%. Based on the results of various 
scenarios of infrastructure development policy, it is expected that the best policy is to increase GRDP.

1. Introduction 
The availability of infrastructure is crucial in economic activity and is one of the drivers of economic growth in a 
region. With adequate infrastructure, facilities in economic activity can be fulfilled. Infrastructure in Indonesia at this 
time, is still considered low both in terms of quality and quantity when compared to other countries, especially in 
Southeast Asia. Recognizing this, the government is currently trying to increase the availability of infrastructure in 
terms of quality and quantity in all aspects of infrastructure needed to leverage the national economy. 
 
Responding to the efforts of the central government in improving infrastructure facilities, the regional government is 
the main object as the first step that must be addressed in order to create equalization of development in both the city 
and regional governments. In this reform then look at the existing situation by comparing the infrastructure budget 
and national income to see the extent of the impact of infrastructure development in leveraging economic growth as 
in Figure 1.

agriculture sector then followed in second place. The sector that emphasizes irrigation infrastructure development gets 
a proportion of 16% or ¼ of the budgeted allocation for infrastructure development costs. Whereas the most recent 
proportion is occupied by the Manufacturing Industry sector which processes sanitation infrastructure in Lumajang 
Regency. In 2021, the increase is not as high as in 2020. Although it has decreased in terms of growth, the value 
generated in the PAD of Lumajang Regency is still higher than 2020 at the point of 480 billion rupiah. The dominance 
of the proportion for construction buildings fell by 2% to 64%. On the other hand, the proportion of the services sector 
which deals with the waste processing infrastructure and the transportation transport sector focusing on drainage 
infrastructure each rose by 8%. In other words, these 2 sectors are ranked third below the agricultural sector. 
Furthermore, in 2022 the growth of PAD increases will return to a better rate of 9.19%. Here the largest proportion of 
financing is dominated by the construction sector again dropping by 2%. Another sector that was later strengthened 
was the gas electricity and clean water sector. The sector that focuses on infrastructure services that provide electricity 
and drinking water networks rose 1% to a total proportion in 2020 of 3%. At the end of the regent's term, an increase 
occurred in the Lumajang Regency's PAD. Although not as drastic as in previous years, the level of infrastructure 
development in Lumajang regency shows a positive increase from year to year. In other words, the financing for 
infrastructure development directly or indirectly greatly affects the regional income of Lumajang Regency itself. In 
2023, it is estimated that with an increase in the total budgetary cost of infrastructure development in the figure of 
69.2 billion, the proportion of development for the construction sector must be reduced again. And the most stagnant 
sector is seen in the financial and rental sectors, which each year only has a proportion of budgeting for infrastructure 
development at 2%. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the applied scenario, the value-added value in each sector is a manifestation of the profit from 
each rupiah invested in a sector. The construction sector, the clean water gas electricity sector, and the transportation 
sector are sequentially a priority sector with an average value of 45.7, 33.2, and 15. The building construction sector 
itself is involved in road and bridge infrastructure, while clean water gas electricity focuses on infrastructure electricity 
and drinking water networks as well as the transportation sector are more dominant in building transportation service 
infrastructure. 
 
An increase in investment in infrastructure development is evidenced by an increase in the development budget at an 
average rate of 500 million each year. The increase in investment was not accompanied by economic growth 
represented by fluctuations in the Lumajang Regency's PAD in the forecast year. 
 
By looking at the regional income output from each strategy, 2 main indicators are applied, namely PAD and 
infrastructure development budget. For the highest PAD it is held by scenario 1 with a scenario of increasing the PAD 
target at 75% while for the lowest infrastructure development budget is held by scenario 
3. The combination of these two indicators is done by looking at the ratio of each parameter, where the best ratio 
between potential PADs is achieved with the minimum budget expenditure falling in scenario 3 with an average value 
at the level of 50% while making scenario 3 the best scenario. 
 
Exit scenario 3 as the best scenario, then the input value of this scenario is used as a strategy especially in determining 
the allocation of financing for infrastructure development in 7 main sectors. The allocation is divided into the 
agricultural sector 15–17%, the manufacturing industry sector 0.07–0.11%, the gas and water supply sector 2.14–
2.42%, the construction sector the construction sector 60.83–65.36%, the transportation and communication sector 
7.26–8.34%, the rental finance sector 2.14–2.42%, and the services sector at 7.24–8.3%.

Abstract 
 
Managing and controlling the spare parts inventory in industries including cement industries is critical activity. In this 
case study, the out of stock incidents especially spare parts in the electrical and instrumentation category were often 
occurring and significantly affecting the maintenance program based on observation and preliminary data collection. 
The purpose of this study is to minimize stock out for electrical and instrumentation spare part in cement industry. 
The lumpy phenomena were happened in some spare parts based on ADI-CV matrix methods and the probabilistic 
methods is needed to manage spare parts. The continuous review method (s, S) policy is selected to determine the 
number of orders (Q), reorder point (ROP) and total inventory costs. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to 
analyse the inventory performance such as inventory costs and service level. The main result of this study is to 
determine the improvement action for managerial to reduce stock out and inventory costs. The main practical 
implication of this study is to increase the service level from 61% - 84% up to 88% - 95% in order to reduce the 
production losses due to stock out of spare parts.

1. Introduction  
Inventory management is significant function in logistics system that is responsible for all decision about stock in an 
organization including raw material, work in process, finished good, and spare parts. It is critical to makes decision 
for policies, activities and procedures to make sure the right amount of each item kept in stock. The main purpose of 
a stock is to provide a buffer between demand and supply.  Spare part is an important part in logistics management 
and supply chain management. This safeguard spare part is very essential to ensure smooth operation and to enable 
operations to be more efficient and productive. Spare part inventory is needed for maintenance and repair final product, 
vehicle, industrial machine and equipment. Inventory management is complex due to the large number of differential 
items and low demand. Inventory influences operating costs - and therefore produces profits, return on assets, return 
on inventory, and almost all other financial performance measures (Octaviana et al. 2018). 
 
Inventory can have a bad impact if it is not managed properly. The first reason for time, which is to deal with 
operational conditions that are not in accordance with planning, where the work unit continues to be held responsible 
for the production process. The second reason is the uncertainty in dealing with demand and supply. And the last 
reason is the economics of scale, that companies are able to achieve economic value in the production process and the 
procurement process. There are several types of inventory that make a difference between companies. Pipeline or 
transit inventory is the inventory that arises because of the long delivery time from one place to another. Cycle stock 
is type of inventory that has a cycle in its movement. The amount of inventory of this type will decrease little by little 
due to being used up or sold out. Safety stock is the one that serves as an anticipation of late delivery. Anticipation 
stock is inventory to anticipate the increase in demand due to the seasonal nature of the demand for a product 
(Octaviana et al. 2018)0. 
Based on PT X (one of the leading cement company in Indonesia) observations, there is no clear theoretical basis in 
determining and planning the needs of spare parts of each controlling unit. In determining the number of requests, it 
is still solely based on estimation, the history of existing requests, or quantity requested by each maintenance unit who 
is informed when making an order. Even when the requesting unit makes an order, sometimes the item is already 
needed at that time also so the ideal condition is that there is already a stock in the warehouse. Based on the history of

From the above simulation Table 10 above it can be seen that the result shows an increase in service level from existing 
condition. Total cost also raises as result of increasing the service level. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The main purpose of this study is to determine reorder point, maximum inventory level, service level and inventory 
cost. Increased service level is more prioritized over inventory cost because the unavailability of spare part can cause 
high production losses. For example, in spare part 631-000490, service level increase from 61% to 88%, but the 
consequence is the cost of inventory increased from Rp7,455,546,477 to Rp82,816,400,435, this is due to an increase 
in the number of orders and the amount of stock in order to reduce shortage.  
 
Practical implications with the existence of this study can improve service level. Then spare part already has an ABC 
classification in SAP system that did not exist before. Stock out is decreasing, this can be seen from the higher service 
level. Losses due to engine breakdown can be reduce so that the loss of production can be reduce as well. The limitation 
of this study is this study does not take into account the age of equipment and also period of major maintenance. 
Therefore, future research can take into account the age of equipment and consider the period of major maintenance 
that company has been scheduled every year.

Abstract.  
Reducing downtime gives a significant impact on productivity growth. Such reduction is a prerequisite for profitable 
and flexible production. The optimal level of preventive maintenance performed on any system guarantees the cost 
effective and reliability of the system.  A model is developed to integrate maintenance strategy decisions and 
production planning. Maintenance strategy should be integrated with production planning. The purpose of this study 
is to identify the factors that influence the heavy equipment maintenance strategy, model the problem of heavy 
equipment maintenance strategies at PT Vale Indonesia and provide recommendations on win-win solutions from the 
perspective of heavy equipment downtime and from a minimization perspective maintenance cost. Linear 
Programming (LP) is used to model the problem situation and then an optimum solution will be proposed. The results 
of the optimization research found that by setting the composition of the use of three types of maintenance strategy, 
namely preventive maintenance, planned maintenance and unplanned maintenance, the optimum maintenance cost 
and downtime can be achieved. The optimization results are used to calculate the production plan to realize a mutually 
beneficial decision between heavy equipment maintenance strategy and production planning.

Introduction 
Mining companies need heavy equipment to support the mining process. This heavy equipment is useful to speed up 
the process and save time, effort, and help do work that is difficult to do manually. Heavy equipment is an investment 
that is very large in value for the company, for this asset must be managed properly and with proper management as 
well, so that it can bring maximum results for the company in carrying out its projects and generate profits for the 
company.   
 
Mining companies want high productivity in carrying out their activities. How fast do we do work like drilling and 
blasting. How many stones can we fit in one shift. How many tons of ore can we move in a year. Calculating the level 
of production and the cost of heavy equipment especially dozers seems like a relatively simple thing. In most cases, 
dozer productivity calculations are based on available literature and equipment specifications published by the 
manufacturer. Dozer performance evaluations often depend on past experience, best estimates or other factors whose 
objectivity is difficult to assess. Production and maintenance planning are some of the most common and important 
issues facing the industry (Xiao et al. 2016). 
 
In traditional maintenance approaches, predefined tasks are performed regularly. This approach is not profitable and 
does not extend the life of the components for as long as possible (Endrenyi et al. 2001). In previous studies, the 
preventive maintenance model incorporates a transition from the degradation stage to one type of maintenance state 
(Chan 1998; Endrenyi et al. 1998). However, depending on the level of deterioration, there is a scope for different 
levels of maintenance (Endrenyi et al. 1998). This study is intended on how to formulate the best maintenance method 
so that a method with the most optimal maintenance costs and the minimum downtime can be obtained. This will 
certainly increase company profits through the achievement of an improved dozer performance compared to 
calculations based on company history or recommendations. Production and maintenance planning are the most 
common and important issues in the industry (Xiao et al. 2016). At the end of this case study, a maintenance strategy 
must be given and the impact on production planning will be given.

Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented a maintenance strategy problem from a case study organization where define dozer 
performance by history is being operated. The two objective functions considered in the mathematical model 
formulation of maintenance strategy problem are: (a) minimize the maintenance cost (Z1) and (b) minimize the 
downtime (Z2) after that calculate the production. This Linear programming model has been solved using LINGO 
solver. The model-1, with objective function-1 and 8 constraints was solved, optimal solution is recorded. For model-
2, objective function-2 with 8 constraints has been solved to get optimal solution at stage-2. Production capacity has 
been counted based on model-1 and model-2 result. This final solution was validated by comparing with the observed 
values of the company for 3 years. This validated model is useful for the company to derive suitable maintenance 
strategy and production plans. Companies can choose the maintenance strategy that will be applied by knowing the 
consequences of each strategy decision chosen. The detail of results are: 
 
a. 
To get optimum maintenance costs and optimum maintenance, the composition of the maintenance strategy used 
is 86% downtime preventive maintenance, 14% planned maintenance and 0% unplanned maintenance from total 
downtime maintenance. 
b. From the results of modelling the two objective functions, the results are better than the budget and actual. There 
is a potential maintenance cost savings of 5.92% against the budget or 21.52% of the actual costs, while for 
downtime there is a decrease in downtime by 20.00% against the budget or 25.38% of the actual maintenance 
downtime. 
c. 
There is a potential increase in physical availability of dozers by 6.53% against the budget and 12.53% to the 
actual, while for the optimization of production planning there is a potential increase in Dozer production capacity 
by 7.68% to the budget and 14.56% to the actual. 
d. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the parameters whose changes are sensitive to the objective 
function and decision variables are budget manhours and actual manpower. The greater the value of the budget 
manhours, the maintenance cost will go down, and the decision variable X1 (Preventive maintenance) is greater 
than X2 (Plan maintenance). The critical point is -19%. As for the actual manpower parameters, the greater the 
actual value of the manpower, the maintenance cost will increase, and the decision variable X1 (Preventive 
maintenance) is greater than X2 (Plan maintenance). The critical point is 24%.

Abstract 
 
Order lot sizing is one of the important mechanisms that must be used by a supply chain to survive in today's business 
competition, especially in food beverage industries with reviews of their wide market coverage. And the problem is 
that generally the order lot size between manufacturers and distributors has not been integrated yet. This study 
discussed how to get their lot size using the Joint Economic Lot Size (JELS) for two levels of supply chains in order 
to reduce total costs. Using the JELS coordination model algorithm, the total cost of integration is Rp 58,271,000- 
with a savings of Rp 15,519,000, where the greatest value of savings occurs to the manufacturer, in the amount of 
Rp 14,991,000. The result shows that using the JELS mechanism, 60.81% cost saving in manufacturer and 21.03% 
cost saving in   all levels could be Obtained.

Introduction 
The integrated inventory management between manufacturers and distributors are part of the supply chain 
management. In determining the lot size inventory management, the manufacturers and distributors can collaborate to 
minimize the total cost of inventory combined. PT HMS is a food and beverage company that has a problem in 
inventory. The problem caused by the lot size determination ordering between manufacturers and distributors is not 
integrated. Determination of an integrated ordering lot size is commonly known as the Joint Economic Lot Size 
(JELS). 
 
Goyal (1977)  in 1976, has developed a method of Joint Economic Lot Size (JELS) by finding a supplier-manufacturer 
ordering interval to minimize the total cost of inventory combined to demand fixed and deterministic. In 1989, Goyal 
and Gupta (1989) JELS is concluded that the early stages of the achievement of coordination in the supply chain (SC). 
Furthermore, several studies about JELS developed for conditions that are not the same as the size of the production 
batch manufacturers are integer multiples of the lot size of the ordering (Goyal 1989), lot different shipping (Goyal et 
al. 2000), lot shipping the same, and the different (Goyal 2000). Besides, research on the two-level supply chain 
coordination with probabilistic demand has been developed by Anshori et.al, (2017). On the same topic, research 
about JELS has been developed by Sarakhsi et al. (2015) to introduce a scatter search algorithm and Nelder-Mead to 
optimize JELS problems.  
 
Based on the description above, this study compares the application of JELS models that have been developed by 
Anshori et al. (2017) with the real conditions in PT. HMS.

1893","delivery of 6 times each. Based on table 3, it can also be seen that there is a total cost saving on the overall level, 
where the savings are Rp 73.79 million – Rp 58.27 million = Rp 15.52 million. The biggest savings occurred on the 
manufacturer, amounting to Rp 24.652 million - Rp 9.661 million = Rp 14.991 million. In other words, by using the 
JELS model there are reductions in costs by 14,991,000/24,652,000 or by 60.81% for manufacturers, as well as 
reductions in costs by 15,519,000/73,790,000 or by 21.03% for the entire level. 
 
4. 
Conclusion 
This research has succeeded in proving that the two-level JELS model yields a smaller overall total cost than the model 
without JELS. The calculation results show that there is a substantial reduction in costs for the manufacturer and for 
the entire level. This inventory model could still be developed for different problems. In this research, a lead time is 
assumed to equal to zero. For the next research could be applied in non-zero lead time, or considering the assumption 
that damage could happen in delivery.

Abstract 
Tires are one of the grounds engaging tools that have a large portion of the costs in maintenance mining heavy 
equipment at nickel mine operations. In line with competition in the mining business, companies are required to 
spend optimum cost. The study was carried out to research the tire life and its relation to achieve the operating 
hours target on a mine haul truck, optimizing tire maintenance costs, and minimize the truck downtime. The 
objectives to be achieved in the study conducted are minimize tire maintenance costs by optimizing tire life and 
increase physical availability. The goal targets that must be achieved are consist of the maximum limit of 
downtime due to tire damage, cost reduction target for tire maintenance costs, as well as the total running hours 
that must be met by the tire, make goal programming modelling is an appropriate method in solving this problem. 
The results of the optimization research found that by setting the composition of the use of three types of tires, 
namely new tires, re-tread tires and rental tires, with a lifetime target according to the results of the mathematical 
model calculated, then the three objectives set can be achieved.

Introduction 
Optimizing the reliability of mining equipment in mine production is the most important factor considering the 
costs incurred in mining operations. These costs are mostly generated by operational activities and maintenance 
of heavy equipment. As a supporting facility to meet production needs, this nickel mine company uses both heavy 
equipment with track type and tire wheel drive type. Comparison of the population of track type and tire wheel 
drive operating in this nickel mine company is 45% of heavy equipment with track type and 55% of heavy 
equipment with tire wheel drive, and 40% instead of tire wheel drive type is OHT hauling truck. Tire costs in 
mining operations are a ground engaging tool that takes a significant portion of maintenance costs. At the mine 
site, with a limited number of trucks, the loss of working hours for one tire can result in the loss of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars.  
 
Previous studies largely discussed how the technical characteristics of tire reliability and tire failure analysis 
(Vaghar 2015), methods of how to manage haul truck tires in their effects on tire life (Lindeque, 2016), and the 
effect of tire pressure on braking and suspension conditions (Toma et al. 2018). Studies on optimizing the cost of 
heavy equipment tires maintenance with a lifetime approach to tires are still rare. The study in this paper focuses 
on modeling the optimization of maintenance costs for 100 Ton OHT hauling truck tires size 27.00 R49 with a 
tire life approach. The optimum tire life calculation is needed in achieving the minimization of tire maintenance 
costs within the limits of various targets that must be achieved.  
1.1.   
Background 
From the various tires size used by heavy equipment in mining operations, tires for 100 Ton Off Highway Truck 
(OHT) are tires with a high maintenance cost, because 70% of the costs are allocated for maintenance of 100 Ton 
OHT tires. The other 30% of the cost is allocated for various tires size. 
 
The other strategy to reduce the cost of tire maintenance activities is to use three types of tires. There are new 
tires, retread tires and rental tires with different service tire life. Tire life fluctuation is one of the contributing 
factors that can affect tire maintenance costs in mining company operations. Data recorded starting from the year

by the rental tire is a minimum of 2,200 hours.

Table 7 also shows that there is still a deviation between the tire service life target set by the company and the 
results of optimization calculations, especially for the service life of new tire types. Three main factors that are 
significant in influencing tire life are tire pressure, load and speed of mining material trucking units. Corrective 
action required to be done to be able to increase the life of the tire so that the life of the tire can reach the optimum 
value according to the calculation results are: 
 
● Monitoring tire pressure 
The recommended corrective action to increase tire life is tire pressure telemetry checking. This can be done with 
a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). The system that is built will give an alarm when the condition of the 
tire pressure is less and real time monitoring of the tire pressure during the unit is used for operation. 
● Monitoring TKPH tires 
Ton Kilo Per Hour (TKPH) is a work parameter for a safe range of overheating when a tire is used for operations. 
TKPH tires are a function of the payload factor and the speed of the mining machine unit. TKPH ban may not 
exceed TKPH field. The recommended corrective action recommended is to monitor TKPH tire measurements in 
real time, because currently the payload data and unit speed can already be monitored in real time. This needs to 
be done to prevent overheating of the tires, tires with overheating conditions can cause defects in the tire separation 
resulting in decreasing tire life. 
● Maintain mine haul road condition index 
The level of damage to a mine haul road due to the operation of a heavy equipment is measured by an index called 
the mine haul road index or also known as the severity index. Monitoring of the level of damage to the mine road 
needs to be done because it impacts the life of the tire. Currently monitoring is carried out on a weekly basis and 
does not run consistently and becomes a late report if there is road damage that exceeds the acceptable range 
value. Recommendations for improvement are suggested by conducting real time monitoring and integrating it 
with maps and work orders for road repairs. Damaged mining roads can cause undulations that can cause damage 
to the sidewall portion of the tire. 
5.   
Conclusion 
This optimization study of maintenance costs for mining heavy equipment was carried out by developing a goal 
programming model through the tire life time approach. The first conclusion obtained in this study is to achieve 
the optimum cost, the lifetime of a tire size of 27.00 R49 that must be achieved is 5,909 hours for new tires, 2,501 
hours for re-tread tires, and 2,200 hours for rental tires. Optimization result shown that by reaching those tire 
lifetime targets, the objective to minimize deviational from objective function can be obtained. Annual running 
hours deviation from target is only 0,57 hours, maintenance cost deviation from target is $0.91, and down time 
target 7% below the maximum down time hours limit. The second conclusion is the results of optimization 
modelling related to tire life in this study can make a positive contribution to the company, especially on the 
potential cost savings. Some of the potential cost savings gained from the hourly cost of tires can be reduced from 
$1.74 per hour to $1.58 per hour, so that value of money, when compared to the actual costs in 2019, can be 
reduced by $499,907.91 or 9% of previous year. In terms of a reduction in downtime due to tire damage, modelling 
can also provide potential savings $760,403.21 for company of and increase the productivity of mining material 
transport trucks. Labour cost factor for tire maintenance and the tire defects condition can be opportunities for 
further evaluation in optimization research related to cost optimization on mining heavy equipment tire 
maintenance.

Abstract 
 
Responding to the Regulation of the Minister of Health Republic of Indonesia no. 3/2019 and no. 86/2019, Surabaya 
City Health Office must evaluate the need for providing maternity waiting homes in Surabaya. Conscientious analysis 
has led to a conclusion that maternity waiting homes is not needed in Surabaya. Instead, the need of shelter and health 
support to support many neglected pregnant women found in Surabaya as a metropolitan and the second biggest city 
in Indonesia is required. This paper presents the results of a need analysis of maternity waiting homes in Surabaya and 
a system analysis to develop a new support for neglected pregnant women in Surabaya. Data gathering has been done 
through a questionnaire and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) involving Non-Profit Organizations (NGOs) and social 
foundations. The cost modelling calculation results show that Surabaya City Health Office should allocate budget at 
least IDR 138,105,000 to help neglected pregnant women in Surabaya. The development of a Management Information 
System (MIS) is recommended to better capture the number and the condition of needy pregnant women and to manage 
the information more accurately. The paper would be useful for other cities to conduct a similar evaluation and analysis.

Introduction 
Indonesian government strives to enhance the quality of life of Indonesian people, particularly in the health sector. 
Decreasing the number of maternal death (women die before, during, and after childbirth) and the number of infant 
mortalities become one of the targets to be achieved at all areas in Indonesia. 
 
Maternal death is measured by maternal mortality rate (MMR), which is defined as “the death of a woman while 
pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from 
any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes” 
(World Health Organization). It becomes the key indicator to measure the efforts to improve the health and safety of 
mothers per country worldwide (World Health Organization 2004). 
 
WHO reported that 75% of maternal deaths caused by high blood pressure during pregnancy, complication from 
delivery, and situation after childbirth including severe bleeding and infection (World Health Organization 2004). A 
research report reported that in Indonesia, maternal mortality can be caused by maternal health conditions, maternal 
age preparedness for pregnancy, antenatal check-ups during pregnancy, assistance during childbirth, postpartum care, 
and other social factors that affect the ability of mothers to access quality health facilities (Susiana 2019). Another 
factor included in the causes of death is unsafe abortion. When a woman experiences one of those conditions, it is a 
must that she gets a proper care at a qualified health facility. Health research reported that the main factors preventing 
women from receiving or seeking proper care during pregnancy and childbirth includes poverty, distance to good 
health facilities, lack of information, inadequate services or facilities in existence health facilities, and cultural barriers 
(Nabieva and Souares 2019).   
 
Moreover, infant mortality is measured by Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), which is defined as “the death of young 
children under the age of 1” (Say et al. 2014). To sharpen this measurement, WHO has developed a measure named 
Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) as part of IMR. NMR is defined as “a death during the first 28 days of life (0-27

This MIS is expected to capture accurate data on the number of neglected pregnant women, the duration of support, 
and the physical/non-physical complexities that need special treatment. The availability of those data will help updating 
of this study for better decision. Moreover, those data can be used to investigate root of the problems causing the cases 
of neglected pregnant women. In long run, the understanding on the root problems can form a better strategy to prevent 
the cases from happening. 
 
6.   
Conclusion and Future Work 
The study presented in this paper has evaluated the suitability of maternity waiting homes in Surabaya and 
recommended that it is not the need of Surabaya people. Instead, the study revealed that there is a need to help neglected 
pregnant women found in Surabaya. The analysis has identified factors that influence the estimated total annual cost 
for supporting neglected pregnant and puerperal women. The cost simulation found that the minimum required budget 
is exceeding the allocated budget from the national government. 
 
As now Surabaya City Health Office has no record at all about the neglected pregnant women found in Surabaya, there 
is a need to develop a MIS to record every single information from various resources. The proposed system would be 
able to capture accurate data and remaining balance of the budget, as the number of neglected pregnant women is 
predicted to be stochastic. This MIS development is recommended as the future work of this study.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of our study is to contrast the P300 and vigilance indicator in hot and humid condition. Sixteen 
participants performed this experiment. The participants are university students with nationality Japanese (eight 
participants) and Indonesia (eight participants). Indonesia participants conducted four experimental conditions: 
standing position and natural condition (without Air Conditioning and fan), standing position and used a fan, standing 
position and used Air Conditioning, and sitting position and used Air Conditioning. Japanese participants conducted 
only one experimental condition (standing position and natural condition (without Air Conditioning and fan). P300 
and vigilance indicators were measured before and after the given task. Event-Related Potential (ERP) P300 and 
Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) were accommodated for P300 and vigilance indicators. According to the 
measurements, the task performances of the Indonesia participants among interaction between the subjects and the 
contrasting conditions were significantly different in ERP P300 latency (p<0.05), ERP P300 potential (p<0.05), and 
mean reaction time of PVT (p<0.05).  On standing position and natural conditioning, P300 and PVT were not 
significantly different by nationality (Indonesia and Japanese students). Results showed that high temperature and 
humidity in the Japan summer season decreased P300 and vigilance, particularly for natural conditions. 
 
1. Introduction 
The summer season (June - September) in Japan is hot and humid. In summer 2019, Japan Meteorology Agency 
(Hamamatsu WMO Station ID:47654 Lat 34°42.5'N Lon 137°43.1'E) reported 25.6 ± 2.3 °C for average air 
temperature and 79 ± 5 % for average relative humidity (Japan Meteorology Agency, 2019). The highest temperature 
was 32.1°C in August 2019.  For students who are from Indonesia with a comfortable temperature range 20 - 26°C, 
and relative humidity maximum 60 ± 5% (SNI 6390:2011) (The National Standardization Body of Indonesia, 2011), 
the heat and humidity in Japan may be difficult to adapt and keep the performance. Still, with the use of Cooling 
Systems (Fan or Air Conditioning), it is possible to avoid heat and discomfort. The use of Air Conditioning in early 
hours sleep can protect sleep and thermoregulation (Okamoto-Mizuno 2004). 
 
According to the previous studies (Roelofsen, 2002; Lan et al. 2010) have shown that human performance and 
productivity shows a significant relationship to thermal condition. Investigating the relationship between indoor 
thermal and human performance needs considering many factors: education, skills, genders, circadian cycle, emotional 
states, response bias, speed, accuracy, etc. (Lan and Lian 2009; Wickelgren 1977). Study on integrating speed and 
accuracy, Lan et al. (2010) mentioned the decrease of task performance due to thermal discomfort. 
 
A few pieces of research have been done on changes such as human cognitive performance due to changes in sleep 
quality and the thermal environment. By examining the relationship between the sleep variables, thermal environment, 
and human cognitive performance, it will be useful for controlling the thermal environment, which is necessary for 
better cognitive performance (P300 and vigilance) in the next day. The aim of this study was to investigate P300 and 
vigilance levels with different cooling systems and positions.

1864","4. Conclusion 
Based on the P300 and vigilance level, the present research shows that in condition 1 (without Air Conditioning, there 
is no difference in two nationalities (Indonesia and Japanese). Furthermore, ERP P300 latency (p<0.05), ERP P300 
potential (p<0.05), and reaction time of PVT (p<0.05) were significantly different in interacting between different 
subject and the contrasting conditions for Indonesia students. The oddball auditory of the P300 wave recorded from a 
peak is smaller and later in discomfort condition (condition 1, standing position, without Air Conditioning and fan). 
The reaction time (vigilance indicator) of the PVT showed later in more comfort conditions (condition 3 and 4). 
Further research is needed to explore the variety condition for Japanese nationality and the relationship of sleep quality 
and performance for both nationalities.

Abstract 
 
Pricing strategy is a method for retailers to compete in the market. The success of the strategy implementation depends 
on several factors, such as customer behavior, market competition, and retailer formats. Suppliers’ existence is also 
important to consider in assessing the effectiveness of the retail pricing strategy, mainly when the strategy is analyzed 
from a supply chain perspective. This paper provides a review of the retail pricing strategy for supply chain. The 
review is focused to three factors that are prominent to retail pricing. They are retail price promotion, retail format, 
and customer preference. The price promotion strategy is highlighted here because this approach is frequently applied 
than the other pricing strategies known in literature. The result of this study informs the existing literature about pricing 
strategy at the retailer level. This study also confirms that there is still limited work in retail pricing strategy, which 
implements the supply chain point of view. 
 
1. Introduction 
Pricing strategy has been considered as an effective way to achieve success for many retailers (Kardes et al. 2011). 
To determine a good pricing strategy, the retailer should understand customer characteristics and behavior. Berman et 
al. (2018) suggest that two factors influence customer shopping decisions. The first is the demographic factor, which 
includes, for example, gender, age, marriage status, and income. The second one is a lifestyle, which considers culture, 
social class, and time utilization.  
 
However, a customer-based factor is not the only aspect to consider in determining the pricing strategy used. The 
market competition also impacts pricing as the competitors can influence the customer decision-making process. 
Moreover, the format of retailers can affect the inventory capacity of retailers, where the stock availability also 
influences the price determination process. In addition, when the issue viewed from a supply chain perspective, the 
competitive behavior of retailers in determining prices can affect the income of the suppliers. Therefore, it is 
reasonable to state that understanding retail pricing strategy requires a systematic approach. 
 
Blattberg and Neslin as cited in Blattberg and Briesch (2012), stated that one of the pricing strategies used by retailers 
to attract customers is promotion. Sales promotion defined as an action-focused marketing event that aims to influence 
customer behavior directly. This approach is found to be adequate to compete with the competitors in the market 
(Huang et al. 2016). One form of promotion that is often applied in practice is a price reduction, where this strategy 
is also often the first choice of consumers in shopping (Smith and Sinha 2000; Das and Kumar 2009). Price reduction 
is also found to be able to increase retailer sales (McNeill 2012). 
 
Several studies have been investigating the effect of promotion on retailers. However, some of these studies have 
different conclusions, such as Osborne (2018) and Arvitrida et al. (2019). Osborne (2018) shows that increasing the 
frequency of promotions does not have a significant impact on sales and revenue. In contrast, Arvitrida et al. (2019) 
find that retailers who offer low depth discounts with high frequencies obtain higher profits and sales compared to 
retailers who offer higher depth and lower frequency discounts. The difference in conclusions from previous studies 
implies that a structured study is required to understand this complex issue, where it can be started from a literature 
study. 
 
This paper aims to provide an initial literature review of the pricing strategy at the retailer level. Narrative review is 
conducted in two steps to synthesize information on retailing pricing strategy literature. First, the literature is collected

1870","in pricing strategy approach. Besides these factors, there is also a lack of work that considers suppliers’ perspective 
and accomplishing level in the market in an integrated model.   
 
In general, competition has become a dominant factor that is considered in many pieces of research related to retailers’ 
pricing strategy up to the present. This is mainly driven by the fact that retailing is closely related to competition, and 
the competition itself becoming the primary driver of pricing strategy. Consumer behavior has also become a factor 
that frequently studied in determining retailers’ prices. Some previous research has considered sales promotion 
together with competition and customer behavior. On the other hand, few researchers have involved retail format and 
sales promotion in their study, but only a few who emphasize capacity as part of the retail format. This can be 
considered as potential gaps to research to understand the impact of retailers’ pricing strategy. Also, the use of supply 
chain perspective in the analysis is found to be limited even though the study of retail pricing strategy has been 
performed for years. An illustration of the potential research opportunity by mapping the existing work explained in 
the previous sections can be seen in Figure 1.  
 
Although this paper addresses several aspects in retail pricing, it has provided a good initial identification on research 
opportunity for supply chain. This can be considered as a contribution as no study has investigated the issue of retail 
pricing strategy in supply chain. However, this literature review still can be extended to obtain a deeper insight as well 
as more findings in identifying the opportunity for research. For example, addressing research in retail pricing and 
joint lot sizing might be useful for future literature review, as joint lot sizing is often viewed from supply chain 
perspective.

5. Conclusion 
This paper has provided a literature review on retail pricing strategy for supply chain. A research opportunity is also 
identified by mapping the previous literature. The review considers several factors, which are competition, customer 
behavior, sales promotion, and retailer format. The types of retailers discussed in this study are stores that sell 
functional or convenience products, while it also investigates the extent of supply chain point of view implemented in 
existing studies. This paper has organized the existing literature about pricing strategy at the retailer level. This study 
also finds that there is not much work that uses supply chain point perspective in the previous research. As discussed 
in the previous section, enhancing this study can be enriched by extending the aspects that are examined, such as 
considering joint economic lot sizing topics in retail pricing strategy. However, in general, this study has provided a 
good initial basis for identifying research opportunity in pricing strategy in supply chains.

Abstract 
This research examines the risk of Mini Container (MiniCon) loading and unloading activities at dock companies. The 
background of this research is based on the current capitalization of a market that gives impetus and increase to the 
demand for distribution of goods. The distribution of goods is mediated in the shipping logistics business industry 
using large container media. The dock company competes among several companies and is driven to innovate a Mini 
Container (MiniCon). Risk analysis on MiniCon's loading and unloading activities was carried out using the House of 
risk (HOR) and Monte Carlo methods. The House of Risk (HOR) method aims to identify the risks that exist in the 
company. Monte Carlo Simulation aims to see the suitability of events that have occurred with the results of the 
simulation. The results of this study include. First, the number of risks identified as many risk events with several 
factors causing risk events in HOR stage 1. HOR stage 2 through ARP assessment results in 2 risk factors. Second, 
Monte Carlo simulation Secondly, the Monte Carlo simulation generates 6 occurrences based on historical data. 
Significance results for several incidents are significantly compared to actual events.

1. Introduction 
Flow in a market capitalization give impetus to the demand for increasing the distribution of goods. The increase in 
the distribution of goods is mediated by the industry in the field of logistics, especially of shipping logistics services. 
An important role of the logistics industry has an impact on the smooth operation of trade, both for the domestic 
market as well as overseas markets. 
 
Distribution of goods in logistics shipping containers typically use the media in the delivery of goods. Types of 
containers that are circulating are dominated by a large size or capacity. It aims to reduce the cost of delivery of goods 
during transit. As a state-owned company competing dominance among private companies both foreign and domestic 
compelled to make changes through innovation a Mini Container (MiniCon). The MiniCon was captured by the 
company as a positive opportunity in the loading and unloading process at the terminal. This is because, that logistical 
innovation is practical because it can be folded and sized one third smaller. Three MiniCons can be loaded into one 
20 TEU container at a time. 
 
Differences MiniCon and conventional containers or large capacity seen in a real application in the field, even though 
both are equally as media goods distribution. The side contrast of large containers, loading and unloading activities 
cause timeouts or dwelling time which is quite time consuming daily. Port dwelling time can be interpreted as the time 
needed for containers to be piled up at a Temporary Piling Place (TPS) / container yard in the port area / area, 
calculated from the time imported goods are unloaded from the ship until they are removed from the TPS (Basuki et 
al. 2015). 
 
The application MiniCon in the port terminal is shown in Figure 1. MiniCon delivery is done with large container 
media by means of being inserted into large containers. MiniCon is then carried with a large container truck and the 
process of unloading through the distribution centre. It is different from the use of large containers that have to go 
through a distribution centre longer than MiniCon. During this stevedoring activity, MiniCon is directly transported 
with a smaller truck and sent directly to the destination.

4. Conclusion 
The operational activity of MiniCon loading and unloading in port terminals is identified by 27 risk events with 87 
factors causing risk occurrence at HOR Phase 1. Based on the number of event identification in HOR Phase 1 
conducted assessment with ARP. The assessment was followed by the use of a Pareto diagram which resulted in 2 
causal factors and 3 preventive action in HOR Phase 2. Later in the Monte Carlo simulation, this simulation is based 
on events or incidents that occur historically on the loading and unloading activities in the company. Events generated 
during the unloading business activities of 6 events. From the incident, this simulation is done by probability and 
produce two types of distribution, namely Beta and Uniform. Whereas the significance of the probability of occurrence 
of events with actual events (historically) is expressed as opposed to real (accepted) with actual events on each 
incident. This research raises new things in the operation of unloading operations, i.e. the use of a MiniCon. Thus, this 
study still has limitations on the deficiencies in sample data. Upcoming research can be done again if the data has 
accumulated more. In addition, on the use of methods used for future research, can use better methods.

Abstract 
Food and beverages risks in production and distribution system are the critical issues for practitioners and 
researchers. Accidents in food and beverages risks can cause human health to be impaired. The objectives of this 
research are to analyze the risks events and recommend the improvement action in the local water supply utility. 
The house of risks method is used to analyze the risks and determine the improvement actions in case study. In 
the first stage of house of risks method, identification and determine occurrence, severity, and detection and 
calculate the aggregate risk potential of agent (ARP). In the second stage, determining preventive action to 
understand the highest risks events. Based on brainstorming with the managers and using the Fishbone Diagram, 
the improvement action could be determined. The implication practices will be described based on the results of 
this study in conclusion sections.

Introduction 
The water supply utility was formed with the objectives to provide healthy, affordable, and safe drinking water 
for the community (Pollard et al 2004). In Indonesia, the water supply utility is carried out by local water 
companies as one of the local-owned business units. The local water supply utilities produce and distribute clean 
water to their consumers. The local water supply utility is available in every province, district, and municipality 
throughout Indonesia. In the Dutch era around the 1920s, the local water supply companies had been managed by 
locally owned business units because clean water was the primary need of the community and affected the health 
of the community. 
 
Many companies in almost all industrial sectors use risk management to manage risks that have occurred or have 
not yet happened, including the industrial water supply utility. Risk identification, analysis, and management 
techniques have been widely applied in several industrial sectors. Some researchers have previously carried out 
risk management studies in water supply utilities. Development and implementation of a water safety plan for 
water quality management using the HACCP approach (Dewettinck et al 2001; Hellier 2000). How is the 
relationship between water utilities and financial risk in water supply utilities (Strutt 2003).  However, there are 
still not many who do risk analysis on the production system and its distribution. The risk of water leaks and 
others is often found and reported in the news media. Several previous studies in the operation level of the water 
utility sectors have been conducted to risk analysis. Author (Parr and Cullen 1988) assessed the reservoir safety 
in operation and structural condition using fault and event tree analysis. (Wirth and Siebert 2000) assessed health 
and safety hazards for chemicals in water and waste in water treatment works using risk ranking, HAZOP (Hazard

Based on the House of Risk Method, there are 24 risk events and 20 risk agents for water supply utility in the 
production process and distribution. Each risk event and risk agent have each correlation value. The highest value 
for ARP in HOR step 1 is 1071, the AM9 risk agent code. Then, it is also shown in Pareto diagram that there are 
10 risk agents whose ARP values exceed 80%. The risk agent will be given a handling strategy. In the stage 2 
HOR, several handling strategies will be chosen which are considered effective to reduce the impact caused by 
risk agents. There are 13 strategies that can be used to eliminate or reduce the emergence of risk agents. The 
priority for preventive action is to do the training routine for employees with ETD value of 7490. These 
recommendations can be made to reduce the risk of water supply to reduce unreliable for water supply.

Abstract 
 
This paper proposes an approach for spare part management that involves conflict of interests between units in a 
company. A case study of spare part problem in a cement industry used, which implicates five working units, called 
user, spare part planning, maintenance planning, procurement of goods and inventory management. The method used 
in this research is to classify spare parts into four categories by considering maintenance and logistics perspectives, 
then using system dynamic model to present the complexity in conflict of interest. This research expected to be useful 
for companies, particularly in managing conflicts in spare part management.

1. Introduction 
Spare parts provided by management to reduce equipment downtime and play an important role in achieving the 
availability of desired equipment with minimum economic costs. This research takes a case in the cement industry 
where the parts procurement process involves several work units, the information obtained by each work unit has not 
been integrated in the decision making related to the exact number of spare parts needs and when these parts will be 
used resulting in conflict interests between these work units. 
 
Some of the consequences arising from the conflict are the accumulation of a small inventory turnover ratio from year 
to year will lead to dead stock of spare parts. Then an increase in the average value of spare parts stored, obsolete of 
spare parts in warehouses because they not used for a long time while there is new technology because upgrading or 
replacing equipment is more sophisticated.

5. Conclusion 
By applying a periodic review inventory control R, s, S, the user does not need to plan for continuous purchases 
because the inventory system is able to make purchase orders automatically provided that the parts are still needed by 
the user. The system will monitor when buying spare parts based on inventory levels that depend also on the use of 
spare parts in the warehouse. The use of spare parts depends on the budget provided by management, whether it only 
considers management policies or also considers the value of inventory as well. If considering the value of inventory, 
it is expected that every budget period given consider the spare parts in the warehouse can be used so that it can reduce 
the deadstock of spare parts in the warehouse 
 
 
Based on the system dynamic model made, in deciding the number of purchases for each of these parts, it must also 
take into account the estimated parts that will used in the same period. Whereas in deciding or estimating the amount 
of spare parts usage in the same period, the budget for each equipment maintenance unit must take into account the 
budget. Then the budget of each work unit for maintenance of production equipment is given based on management 
policies related to the budget allocation given in one year to a production plant, then based on the history of the use 
of the budget and planned maintenance activities that use spare parts in the warehouse. 
 
This research is able to represent the dynamics in spare parts management that does not necessarily consider the spare 
parts classification approach and inventory policy. Nevertheless, other factors can influence management decisions in 
providing spare parts. The approach uses a system dynamic simulation.

Abstract 
 
Roemani Hospital is one of the private hospitals in the Semarang area. Roemani Hospital procurement activities 
carried out by the procurement unit. The procurement unit conducts procurement of goods and services to run the 
Roemani Hospital business process. The Roemani Hospital procurement unit works according to the Roemani 
Hospital organizing guidelines. However, the performance of the Roemani Hospital procurement unit is only reactive 
to demand. The procurement unit does not have a strategic role in running the Roemani Hospital business processes. 
Therefore, it is necessary to assess the procurement maturity level for the Roemani Hospital procurement unit. The 
assessment was carried out to formulate recommendations for improvement in the Roemani Hospital procurement 
unit. In this study, the model used is the Supply Management Maturity Model. The model has five assessment 
characteristics, namely procurement planning, organizational structure of purchasing, process organisation, human 
resources and leadership, and purchasing controlling. Based on these five characteristics 56 questions were formulated 
to conduct the assessment. The assessment results show that the Roemani Hospital procurement unit is in stage 2 or 
Independent. Furthermore, the formulation of recommendations for improvement for the Roemani Hospital 
procurement unit was carried out.

1. Introduction  
Procurement is one of the important activities. An improper procurement process can lead to getting rid of suppliers, 
wrong suppliers, low supplier-level competitiveness, incorrect requirements, and wrong decision making. Research 
conducted at several companies in the United States found that around 60% of the budget was spent on procurement 
activities. It shows that procurement activities are strategic activities in an organization (Rack 1988). Therefore, an 
effective and efficient procurement process is needed for the organization. An assessment to measure the procurement 
unit will produce good results for the company. 
 
Performance appraisal is the process of measuring an organization in achieving its goals. Performance appraisal can 
also be interpreted as a periodic determination of the operational effectiveness of an organization, parts of the 
organization, and its personnel based on a predetermined vision and mission. The procurement unit also had several 
problems. The procurement unit has not yet implemented its vision and mission properly. While the vision and mission 
are the basis of reference and goals of the organization. Vision and mission is also one tool to measure the performance 
of an organization in carrying out its duties (Keban 2013). Vision and mission are also one measure of the maturity of 
the procurement unit (Guth 2010). Organizations are operated by human resources, so performance appraisal is 
actually an assessment of human behavior in carrying out roles in the organization.  
 
The performance appraisal process begins with determining the organization's goals, then analyzing the performance 
to determine the expectations of the organization's leaders in implementation. Finally, the assessor measures 
performance and evaluates, then compares it to the work target, then discusses and communicates the results of the 
assessment, followed by planning for a performance improvement program. In the performance evaluation process, 
organizations can use a variety of different measures for organizational planning, measurement and evaluation.

7. Conclusion 
Procurement maturity is a measure of procurement activities included in strategic management decision making. In 
this study the method used is Supply Management Maturity Model. In the measurement method there are five criteria 
for measuring the maturity of procurement. These criteria are procurement planning, organizational of purchasing, 
process organization, human resources and leadership, and purchasing controlling. 
 
Procurement planning has four aspects of assessment, i.e. demand planning, pooling planning, environment scan, and 
innovation planning. On these criteria, the lowest evaluation aspect is innovation planning. In the organizational 
structure of purchasing criteria there are two aspects of assessment i.e. structure and mandate of purchasing, and 
strategic integration. Based on these criteria, the lowest evaluation aspect is strategic integration. Process organization 
has seven aspects of assessment, i.e. sourcing strategy, supplier selection, supplier evaluation, supplier development, 
purchasing early involvement in development process, early supplier involvement process, and process involvement 
with other functions. On these criteria, the lowest valuation aspect is early supplier involvement in development 
process. In the criteria of human resources and leadership there are three aspects of assessment, i.e. job description 
and competencies, personnel selection and integration, and performance appraisal and career development. Based on 
these criteria, the lowest evaluation aspects are performance appraisal and career development. In the purchasing 
controlling there are three aspects of assessment, i.e. controlling system, controlling process and structure, and 
controlling methods and tools. On these criteria the lowest evaluation aspect is the controlling system. 
 
Measurement of maturity level is done by advertising a questionnaire containing 56 questions to the Roemani hospital 
procurement unit. The measurement results of the maturity level of procurement of Roemani Hospital procurement 
unit shows that the maturity level of Roemani Hospital procurement unit is in stage 2 (independent). These results 
mean that the procurement unit does not yet have a strategic role in Roemani Hospital business activities. In this case, 
the Roemani Hospital procurement unit has not been able to fully integrate the company's strategy in carrying out the 
procurement function. Roemani Hospital procurement unit is still focused on reducing costs in carrying out their 
duties. 
 
Based on the results of the assessment, recommendations were obtained to improve procurement performance. The 
recommendations for improvement include carrying out systematic design in innovation, observing provider markets, 
formulating procurement strategies, designing measurement systems, developing information technology, developing 
suppliers, and other recommendations such as involving procurement in the decision making process, formulating 
contract management systems, and making workshop for introduction to the hospital environment.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to measure customer satisfaction level and customer loyalty level provided by Indonesian banking 
industry. Where the main function of a bank is as an effective and efficient tool to collect and distribute of public 
funds, means that banks are intermediary institutions that have excess funds, namely those who invest their funds 
in banks in various forms of savings, for example savings, deposits, with those who lack of funds, those who need 
funds from banks. Banking is a financial institution which has very important role to driving national economic 
life, where banks are involved in provide credit activities and various services to provide financing facilitate 
payment system mechanisms in the economic sector. But in its services not all customers are satisfying with bank 
services. Therefore, researchers interested of discussing study of the effect of service quality toward customer 
loyalty with customer satisfaction in financial service industry at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk at 
Cepu branch as intervening variables. Population study case are customers who save their money in PT Bank 
Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk at Cepu outlet. Where variables in this study include: product quality (x1), 
tangibles (x2), empathy (x3), responsive (x4), reliable (x5), assurance (x6), satisfaction customer (Y1) and loyalty 
customer (Y2). This study of research is a sample case whose respondents consisted of 100 customers in the PT 
Bank Rakyat Indonesia Persero Tbk at Cepu outlet. Data collection techniques are using a questionnaire. Then a 
survey of BRI customers (general customers BRI & customers priority BRI).

1. Introduction 
Banking is a financial institution which has very important role to driving the life of the national economy. This 
is due to the fact that national banking is one of the tools that help to realize the goals of National Development, 
which is contained in the General Explanation Section of clause number 7 of 1992 regarding Republic of Indonesia 
Law. Bank is a business entity to collects funds from public in saving forms and channels them to the community 
in credit forms or other forms in order to increase economic growth. As for the one of the products that I examined 
is taking the banking sector, namely PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk at Cepu Branch. According to law 
number 10 of 1998, the main function of banks is as an effective and efficient tool to collect and channel public 
funds, meaning that banks are intermediary institutions for excess funds, namely those who invest their funds in 
banks in various forms of deposits. For example; savings, deposits, with parties that lack funds, those who need 
funds from the bank. Thus, the banking sector is engaged in credit activities and various services to provide 
financing facilitate payment system mechanisms in the economic sector. By using respondents who are customers. 
Researchers are interested in examining the quality of services in the PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk at 
Cepu outlet because it is of one the banking industry that prioritizes service aspects in meeting various customer 
needs (Kotler 1998). 
 
Suggests satisfaction is a level of feeling happy or disappointed someone who appears after comparing the 
perceptions of product performance and its expectations (Kotler 1998). Definitively satisfaction can be defined as 
follows (Engel et al. 1995) ""Satisfaction is an alternative of evaluation after consumption to meet or exceed the 
expectation, in short this alternative work at least as well as we hoped"". ""Consumer satisfaction, according to 
(Tjiptono 2000) after evaluation purchase and choose the alternative that provides the similar expectations or

Abstract 
This study aims to id This study aims to identify factors affecting the success of process innovation at State-Owned 
Enterprises (SOEs) of Indonesia. Delphi method was used to reach consensus among 14 (fourteen) members of an 
experts panel selected from industries, a Director General of Ministry of Research and Technology, a former of Head 
of The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology and a university professor were selected as expert 
panels. The respondents were asked to respond the questions on input, process, output, outcome, diffusion, innovation 
strategy, culture, knowledge, definition of process innovation, successful process innovation experience, as well as 
pull and push factors of process innovation. The respondents’ answers to the questionnaire of first cycle consisting 15 
(fifteen) open-ended questions were varied. This is due to the heterogeneity of backgrounds of the respondents i.e. 
state-owned enterprises, policy makers and a university professor. Of the 15 (fifteen) questions, 105 (a hundred and 
five) factors affecting the success of process innovation were obtained. The second cycle of questionnaire will reduce 
the number of factors affecting performance through respondents’ consensus.

1. Introduction 
Innovation has been a widely researched topic to be examined by researchers from universities, industry, and 
government agencies in the last decade (Kunz 2007); (Porter 1990); (Angelmar 1990). The World Economic Forum 
states that innovation can drive a country's economic growth (World Economic Forum 2017). Therefore, innovation 
is a top priority for companies to increase profits and for countries to increase their economic growth. Innovation can 
take various forms including product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation, and organizational

1922","Of the 15 (fifteen) open-ended questions, respondents who experts in the field of innovation are argued that there were 
105 (a hundred and five) factors that determine the success of an innovation program or project. Table 2 above is a 
sample of respondents' opinions on the question of what process or program determines the ideas of innovation can 
turn into innovation. The respondents assumed that there were 10 (ten) factors that can make an innovation idea 
realized into innovation. The ten factors have passed coding process conducted by the researcher. Some respondents 
used different terms; some factors were mentioned by more than one respondent. The same method (coding) was 
carried out on 14 (fourteen) other questions. 
 
The heterogeneity of respondents resulted in advantages and drawbacks. The advantage is that because the respondents 
have different backgrounds, they have different challenges and experiences, thus the answers to the questions given 
were also different. Respondents with a cement industry background have different challenges and experiences than 
those with a railroad industry background and even those with service industry background. With these, the authors 
could gain a wide range of information. On the other hand, the heterogeneity of the respondents also brought 
drawbacks that the research could produce applicable conclusions for all SOEs industries. Therefore, carefulness must 
be taken in designing a questionnaire, conducting the analysis, and drawing research conclusions. 
 
In the second stage, each question will be equipped with a Likert scale 1 (very insignificant) to a Likert scale 5 (very 
important). Respondents will find it easier to answer the questions because they only need to choose numbers on the 
Likert scale. Answers to the second cycle of questions can provide information on what questions (factors) the 
respondent thinks are important and what questions (factors) the respondent thinks are not important. Based on these 
answers, the elimination of questions (factors) that are not important to be asked again in the third cycle will be carried 
out. The final conclusion about the factors that determine the success of the process innovation program or project 
will be determined after the third cycle of questions has been carried out and the results have been analysed. The 
second cycle of questions will be distributed on 28 August 2020 and the deadline for returning the answers is 4 
September 2020. Furthermore, the third cycle questions will be distributed on 18 September 2020 and the deadline 
for returning the answers is 2 October 2020.

Abstract 
 
In carrying out the business activities especially in procurement process, CV. PT experienced some problems, such as 
incompatibility the material specifications and broken stitches on cloth. This problem causes a decrease of company 
productivity. Therefore, an evaluation of supply chain performance is needed in order to identify problem indicators, 
and determine improvement strategies for problem indicators. In this study, the measurement of the company supply 
chain performance is using the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) approach. The initial hierarchy model of 
performance measurement is adjusted to the condition of the company to measure supply chain performance using 
KPI performance indicators. A Snorm De Boer then is utilized to serves and equalize the matrix values derived from 
company annual data. The final stage in this study is measuring the importance of performance indicators using 
pairwise comparison weighting. The results obtained in this study are the total supply chain performance of CV. PT 
is 69.983 included in the average category. There are several performance indicators included in the average and 
marginal categories, so it needs to be improved. The improvement is given based on the practices in SCOR 12.0.

1. Introduction 
The development of the industrial world which is increasingly fast challenging between companies is also increasingly 
stringent. In the past few years, excellence in supply optimization and integration has become the focus of several 
large corporate organizations in the world. The increasingly fierce business competition in this era of globalization 
requires every effort to rearrange its business strategies and challenges. The essence of competition discusses how 
companies implement processes in producing products that are better, cheaper and faster than produced (Amit and 
Zott 2010). 
 
The high business competition is one of the reasons companies must fulfil customer orders in the right amount and 
time. It is intended that the company can control the market share in the community. This condition shows the 
importance of improving performance, not only within a company but also other parties in the supply chain involved, 
in order to compete with other companies or supply chains. 
 
Performance measurement is very important because it can control the system both directly and indirectly. 
Performance measurement serves to keep the company on track to achieve supply chain goals. In the context of supply 
chain management, performance measurement is very important to support the success of a supply chain management. 
The concept of supply chain management is able to integrate the management of various management functions in a 
relationship between organizations forming an integrated and mutually supportive system (Mutakin 2011).

Abstract 
The food service sector is the third-largest source of food waste (covering 18% of the total) after households and the 
food industry in terms of food input at each stage in the value-added chain. The problem of managing food waste in 
the foodservice sector is a complex phenomenon and includes a variety of factors and activities. By using a system 
dynamics method, the purpose of this study is to obtain an overview of the results of research of strategy that can be 
used as a consideration for making policies to reduce food waste in the foodservice sector. Food waste of restaurants 
in Surabaya is currently estimated at 61.23 kg per restaurant per day. Three scenarios developed in this study include 
increasing the frequency of purchases, implementing a fine system for customers who leave food scraps and 
cooperating with the food bank. Based on the simulation results, the highest percentage reduction is achieved by 
applying the third scenario with a reduction of food waste by 25.10% per day. Therefore, this research shows that 
restaurants should start to consider collaborating with food banks to donate their serving losses to those who need it. 
The effect of scenario simulation is uncertain and cannot be taken for granted. However, this study provides an 
overview of the potential impacts of the scenarios developed.

1. 
Introduction 
Food loss and waste can be interpreted as the amount of edible material that is wasted or lost in the food supply chain 
at various stages. Food that lost at the harvest or processing stage is called food loss, while food that lost at the 
consumer or retail stage is called food waste where this occurs because of the habit of buying more than we need at 
the supermarket, letting fruits and vegetables spoil at home or ordering more than we can eat in a restaurant. Annual 
global food waste is estimated to be around 1.3 billion tons, which is equivalent to about 30% of total food products 
intended for human consumption. This shows that the amount of food produced is far greater than what is actually 
consumed (Haque et al. 2016). The problem of food waste directly linked with environmental (e.g. energy, climate 
change, availability of resources), economic (e.g. resource efficiency, price volatility, increasing costs, consumption, 
waste management, commodity markets) and social (e.g. health, equality) impacts (Stenmarck et al. 2016). 
 
The food service sector is the third-largest food waste source (covering 18% of the total) after households and the food 
industry in terms of food input at each stage in the value-added chain (Betz et al. 2015). Several studies have been 
carried out to estimate food losses after the farm level, but most studies take into account losses that occur up to the 
retail level, but not losses between retail purchases and consumption, such as storing, cooking, and preserving food 
(Engström and Carlsson 2004). The food service sector has every reason to be at the forefront of efforts to reduce food 
losses along supply chains and food waste caused by individuals at the point of consumption. This relates to the big 
impact may be achieved when addressing food waste in a food service sector where there are many individuals dining 
in the same way. Despite this, academic research on food waste that considers how the food service sector can 
effectively make meaningful reductions has been slow to emerge (Mirosa 2016). 
 
The problem regarding food waste in recent years has become an important topic because of its large impact both on 
the economy, the environment, and the food security of a country. Interest in reducing food waste is also growing 
rapidly to ensure adequate food for a fast-growing population (De Steur et al. 2016). The target of this study is to find 
good potential for measures to reduce food waste in the foodservice sector, especially in the restaurant. Problem-
related to food waste is not a simple problem but rather a problem that is large enough and full of complexity (FAO

1939","restaurant consumer survey by asking how concerned they were with the problem of food waste from a scale of 0-1. 
Based on the survey, it was found that the average consumer awareness of restaurants in the city of Surabaya regarding 
the problem of food waste is 0.75 or 75%. By applying this scenario, it is assumed that consumer awareness of food 
waste can increase by at least 95%. 
 
3.4.3 Scenario 3 
The objective of scenario 3 is to collaborate with the food bank to donate their leftovers that are suitable for 
consumption so those who need them. When viewed from the perspective of reducing food waste, food banks appear 
to be socially desirable solutions to better utilize food waste. Food banks need to be considered as one of the scenarios 
because food banks can provide benefits to the private sector, namely reducing the cost of waste management (if any), 
then can benefit the charitable organizations involved and provide social benefits, namely ensuring access to food for 
the poor in the population (Gustavsson et al. 2011). This scenario is done by transferring serving losses to the food 
bank. This scenario is suitable for buffet restaurants or restaurants that apply batch cooking because the food that has 
been served is usually still appropriate to be given to food banks rather than plate waste, storage losses, and preparation 
losses. 
 
3.5 Result Analysis 
The simulation is carried out with the assumption that demand is normally distributed so that the demand value changes 
during the simulation. Therefore, simulation running was carried out with replication of 5 times and then calculating 
the average. The results of each scenario can still be compared by looking at the percentage of decrease before applying 
the scenario to the moment after the scenario is applied. Scenario results are presented in Table 2 which shows the 
value of total food waste for the existing conditions and each scenario.

The results of the application of scenario 1 by increasing the frequency of purchases can reduce food waste generated, 
but the percentage of waste reduction generated is around 6.83%, As explained earlier, this scenario has an impact on 
storage losses which if the losses here can be minimized, it is seen that there will be a noticeable increase in profits. 
This might be caused by food ingredients that are used effectively. For scenario 2, the percentage of food waste 
reduction generated is quite low at only around 3.23%. In this scenario there is no significant increase in profits 
although there is a slight increase. This scenario has an impact on the amount of plate waste produced, so when the 
resulting plate waste can be minimized, this will not have too much effect on profits because even if customers leave 
food scraps on their plates, they have paid for the food they take, so the restaurant doesn't suffer losses. Furthermore, 
for scenario 3, the percentage of reduction in food waste produced is high which is 25.10%, However, the decrease in 
food waste does not cause an increase in profit, it is because the restaurant has incurred costs to prepare food but the 
food actually becomes serving losses which even though the serving losses do not become food waste but the serving 
losses are donated, so the restaurant remains incur economic losses but these foods can still be consumed effectively. 
An increase in profit might be felt by the restaurant if there is a waste processing cost that they must spend for every 
kg of waste they produce. So, the more food waste they produce, the more costs they have to spend. However, in this 
study, these costs are not included in the model. 
  
4. Conclusions 
Many factors have the potential to cause food waste, not only from infrastructure and technical factors but also caused 
by human behaviour. The problem of food waste must be the responsibility of all of us, not only for service providers 
such as restaurants or suppliers but also for us consumers who must help protect the environment. Based on the 
simulation results, from the perspective of reducing food waste, scenario 3 is the most effective scenario in reducing 
food waste. The highest percentage reduction is achieved by applying the third scenario with a reduction of food waste 
by 25.10% per day. Therefore, this research shows that restaurants should start to consider collaborating with food

are not aware of the food waste they produce, by applying this scenario it is expected to reduce the rate of increase of 
restaurant’s food waste in Surabaya. The effect of the scenario simulated is uncertain and cannot be taken for granted. 
However, this study provides an overview of the potential impacts of the scenarios developed.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this research is to determine the indicators of the factor affecting consumer buying interest on frozen 
chicken processed products and consumer cluster analysis. The data obtained through questionnaires distributed to 
200 respondents. Seven factors are affecting the buying interest, product, price, promotion, distribution, individual 
characteristics, social life, and psychological aspect. All factors consist of some indicators. The results showed that 
22 indicators that have been determined reduced to 16 indicators based on the results of factor analysis, and grouped 
in 6 factors.  The cluster analysis results from this study formed 2 clusters that the factors of buy interest and 
characteristics of respondents vary in each cluster. The first cluster consists of 138 samples and the second cluster 
consists of 58 samples the first cluster dominates by the female private employee group and second cluster dominate 
by wife household group. All factors hypothesized affecting the customer buying interest are proven for the first 
cluster. While for the second cluster the factors that affect the buying interest are product attributes, price, and 
distribution.

1. Introduction 
The Indonesian poultry industry is a key sector for the national economy, supplying 65% of all animal protein and 
employing 10% of the national labour force (Ferlito and Respatiadi 2019). Food processing industries grow rapidly 
by the emergence of frozen food which is often found in modern markets, hotels, restaurants, and supermarkets, and 
increasing the competition level. Modern public awareness of healthy fast food increases by the emergence of 
processed products of frozen chicken. Business actors must be able to understand the demand and consumer needs 
that change from time to time. Semarang is one of the potential markets for the frozen chicken processed product. 
Currently, various types of frozen food are emerging with a variety of interesting processing and serving creativity, 
one of which is processed chicken products such as frozen nuggets, meatballs, sausages, and so on. 
 
Companies that already have a place in the hearts of the consumer with various superior products such as PT. So Good 
Food, PT Charoen Pokphand, PT Belfoods Indonesia, and some micro businesses compete to sell their product. Also, 
the government encourages the growth of slaughter, storage, and meat processing manufacture, then the poultry 
product no longer sold as fresh food but frozen food. Figure 1 shows us the projected compound growth for the Annual 
Growth Rate of several types of food and beverages in Indonesia from the period 2013 to 2017. The projected growth 
for frozen processed food almost reaches 20 %. The rapid growth of the food and beverage industry has made business 
people understand the demands and needs of consumers as a top priority. The growth of the food and beverage industry 
is influenced by rapid changes in customer preferences (Nisar 2014). In more mature households, the tendency to buy 
canned and preserved food decreases. The tendency to consume something instant like fast food occurs in young 
couples. This is quite a serious concern for processing industries that the enthusiasts of frozen food consumers still 
fluctuate. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the factor of consumer buying interest on the frozen processed product 
which is ideal for all people, especially frozen chicken processed products. There were more than 30 registered micro-
businesses at Semarang in 2017 that operate their business on frozen processed food. This shows that the business is 
a potential sector and has a huge market share of food products in Semarang. Based on a survey conducted by Mars

The specific factor in frozen food distribution is cold chain system which requires quite expensive infrastructure 
especially in a large capacity. Cold chain must also be carried out during the transportation process. Optimal storage 
temperature of deep-frozen food products ranges from -18 to -25 and for frozen food is – 20 (Mercier et al. 2017). The 
existence of this cold chain has a big influence on product quality, prices and product availability. A firm in the frozen 
food industry is focusing limited resources on developing core competencies by enhancing R&D and introducing new 
products, and have spent resources on developing the transportation system, distribution system and the capacity of 
the retailers. The future shows much potential as third-party companies to develop cold chain warehousing and 
distribution (Kitinoja 2014). This condition also occurs in Indonesia. Purwaningsih (2019) found that the performance 
of every company in the chicken supply chain was quite efficient, but the long supply chain created high prices at the 
end consumer level. This is compounded by fluctuations in selling prices because coordination for population control 
is still weak (Purwaningsih et al. 2018). For frozen food, the material is taken directly from the company farm so that 
the price of raw materials is cheaper, but the cost for cold chain in transportation and product distribution makes the 
price at retailers expensive. Also, the highest price margin increases in the supply chain of poultry products occurred 
at the retail level due to the small sales volume (Betrand et al. 2018). 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of factor analysis there are 6 factors of buying interest formed from 16 indicators and 5 indicators 
proven has no significant correlation to all factors. The factors are the marketing mix of the product (product attributes, 
price, promotion, and distribution), psychological factor, and the social factor. Indicators that have a strong correlation 
to the factors from factor analysis means that these indicators affecting the buying interest. 
 
The indicators which have a significant correlation to product attributes are nutrition content and halal food label. All 
indicators in price factor, promotion factor, and distribution factor have a significant correlation to their factor. All 
psychological indicators have significant correlation informed the factors. Social factors show that the product 
information from work partners and friends affecting the buying interest. Lifestyle has no significant effect on buying 
interest. The product attribute brand, taste, packaging, and flavor have no significant correlation to product factors.  
 
Cluster analysis formed two groups of customers. The first group are female, age between 17-38 years old, occasion 
as a private employee and have a salary of up to 3 million per month. All factors in this research are affecting the 
buying interest for the first cluster. The second cluster is female, age between 17-27 years old, occupation as wife 
household and have income between 2 up to 3 million per month. The factors affecting their buying interest are price, 
promotion, and distribution.

Abstract 
 
The infrastructure sector is one of the sectors in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. At present, the sector is of concern to 
the public because infrastructure development is increasing as evidenced by an increased budget every year. Thus, 
attracting the desire of the community to invest in the sector. However, stock returns in this sector not only increased 
but also decreased. This study aims to determine the effect of financial ratios and macroeconomics in the Infrastructure 
sector on stock returns partially and simultaneously. The Secondary data testing to determine the effect partially and 
simultaneously was done using a panel data regression. Panel data regression results shows one point Debt to Equity 
Ratio (DER) and Earning per Share (EPS) can reduce stock returns, then one point Return on Equity (ROE) can 
increase stock returns partially. However, all variables simultaneously have a significant effect on stock returns 
because of the value of prob (F-statistic) less than 0.05. The conclusion is that six variables significantly influence 
simultaneously, but only DER, ROE, and EPS have a partially significant effect. That means the macroeconomics in 
Indonesia doesn’t have a significant impact on stock returns in the sector.

1. Introduction 
The increasing trend of Indonesia Composite Index values indicates the number of good companies in Indonesia with 
sufficient capital. One of them is the Infrastructure, Utilities, and Transportation sector, which is an indispensable 
sector in the economic development of a country. The availability of infrastructure can increase productivity and 
efficiency which results in increased economic growth. Currently, the infrastructure sector gets public interest because 
in the period of President Jokowi (since 2014) there has been an increase in infrastructure development. The increase 
in the period is evident from the infrastructure budget that increases each year which reaches 415 Trillion in 2019 
(Data obtained from the Ministry of Finance). However, stock returns in this sector has increased and decreased or 
not always increase. The stock return is the stock investment income, predominantly including stock value changes 
and cash dividend income of the holding period (Guoying and Ping 2017). The empirical results indicated that stock 
return has a significant impact on investor sentiment, not converse, and investor sentiment has an asymmetric impact 
on stock return during the bear market, but the bull market doesn't exist (Li and Junwen 2016). 
 
Research in this paper focuses on determining factors that can significantly influence stock return on the Infrastructure, 
Utilities, and Transportation sector with used panel data regression. That factors are financial ratios and 
macroeconomic which are independent variables. Infrastructure development and macroeconomic development are 
interrelated. That is because infrastructure development gives rise to economic multiplier effects and economic 
expansion raises the need to develop existing infrastructure. Thus, researchers used several external factors from the 
macroeconomic to find out the actual impact on companies in the Infrastructure, Utilities, and Transportation sectors. 
The macroeconomic chosen are the exchange rate, inflation, and economic growth.  Whereas the financial ratios used 
are Debt to Equity Ratio (DER), Earning per Share (EPS), and Return on Equity (ROE).  
 
In many previous research, the object is a sub-sector or one company, whereas the object of this research is one sector. 
Thus, investors or companies can understand the effects of financial ratio and macroeconomic on stock returms in one 
sector, especially the infrastructure sector. This research was made for investors who want to invest in companies of

The Probability (F-statistic) value in Figure 6 is the simultaneous value of the regression model, if the Probability (F-
statistic) value is less than (<) significance value (0.05), then it influences simultaneously between the independent 
variables on the dependent variable (stock returns). In addition, the smaller significant value obtained, the accuracy of 
this research will be greater. In Figure 6 also known that the R-squared of 0.846445, which means the proportion of 
the influence of the dependent variable can be explained by the model by 84.64%, while the rest of 15.36% (100% - 
84.64%) influenced by other variables not included in the regression model in this paper. 
 
Panel data regression Results can find out the result of the T Test and F Test with the formula, namely: 
 
Y = 30.21026 + (-7.310828) XIt1 + 328.7786XIt2 + (-0.122179) XIt3 + eit 
(2) 
 
In the F Test results, the p-value (Prob > F) is 0.000 less than the significance value (𝛼𝛼 = 0.05), so the decision taken 
is Reject H0. That are DER ROE, EPS, Exchange Rate, Inflation, and Economic Growth simultaneously have a 
significant effect on stock returns in the Infrastructure, Utilities, and Transportation sector. On the T Test result, the 
p-value (Prob> F) is 0.0013 (DER), 0.0000 (ROE), 0.0015 (EPS), 0.7077 (Exchange Rate), 0.3393 (inflation), and 
0.7895 (economic growth). Thus, only DER, ROE, and EPS partially have a significant effect because the p-value 
(Prob> F) is less than the significance value (0.05). 
 
4. Conclusion 
Panel data regression analysis results showed that DER, ROE, and EPS partially have a significant effect on stock 
return, namely one point of DER ratio can decrease stock return of 7.310828; one point of ROE ratio can increase 
stock return of 328.7786; and one point of EPS ratio can reduce stock return of 0.122179. However, DER, ROE, EPS, 
Exchange Rate, Inflation, and Economic Growth simultaneously have a significant effect on stock return because the 
probability value (F-statistic) < significance value (0.05).  
 
Result from this study have important managerial implications. Investors who want to invest in companies of the 
Infrastructure, Utilities and Transportation sector, it is very necessary to pay attention to the financial ratio, especially 
DER; ROE; and EPS than the macroeconomic if the macroeconomic does not change drastically. Companies in the 
sector must also pay attention on financial ratios to stock return. Stock return can increase if the value of DER and 
EPS should be small and the value of ROE must be high, some of which are debt value should be smaller; net income 
value should be higher; and weighted average value of outstanding share should be higher. 
Since it is crucial to find out the effect on financial ratios and macroeconomics on stock return in this sector, it is 
important to recognize this research have certain limitation. The main limitation of this research is only 13 samples 
that can be proceed because only 13 samples that passed the classical assumption test. Therefore, it is recommended

Abstract 
 
The main causes of hyperlipidemia include the consumption of a high-fat diet, which results in atherosclerosis and 
heart disease. Prevention of hyperlipidemia can be done by consuming foods rich in antioxidants, such as anthocyanins 
contained in black rice bran. This study aims to evaluate the anti-hyperlipidemic effect on soy fortified with black rice 
bran extract on humans, which in research conducted on Wistar (Rattus norvegicus) rat research animals. This study 
aims to evaluate the effect of anti hyperlipidemia on soygurt enriched with black rice bran extract on Wistar (Rattus 
norvegicus) rats. This research was conducted in vivo. Research materials included soygurt and black rice bran extract. 
The research stages included preparation of animal lab, 28 male Wistar rats, 3 weeks old; feed AIN-93G (G) and AIN-
93M (M); adaptation a week; depletion period for 5 weeks, until hyperlipidemia with total cholesterol levels ± 200 
mg/ml and total triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dl. Separated into 4 diet treatment groups, namely without a standard diet, M 
diet + demineralized water (P = placebo); M diet + soygurt dried (K = control), M diet + 50 mg black rice bran extract 
enriched in soygurt (S-50), and M diet + 100 mg black rice bran extract enriched in soygurt (S-100) for 5 weeks. 
Taken blood from retroorbital flexus, euthanization, and surgery. Analyses were changed in total cholesterol levels, 
total triglyceride levels. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of one-way variants (One Way Anova) with 
Minitab 17 at a significance level of 5%. If there are significant differences, then proceed with the Tukey's test 
(p≤0.05). The results showed that the S-100 group was able to reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride levels after the 
end of treatment at 95.13 mg/dl and 69.55 mg/dl. Changes in total cholesterol levels during the study, namely at the 
early until the induction increased by 57.19% and the induction to the end decreased by -48.19% had a positive effect 
on the treatment of S-50 and S-100 reducing total cholesterol levels. Whereas for the total triglyceride levels during 
the study, at the early until the induction increased by 46.51% and the induction to the end decreased by -48.42%, a 
positive effect of the treatment of S-50 and S-100 decreased total triglyceride levels.

Hyperlipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by increased levels of cholesterol, LDL (Low-Density 
Lipoprotein) and decreased HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein). Factors triggering such conditions include a family 
history of dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, overweight, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and 
diabetes. Besides a diet that is high in cholesterol such as cow brain, egg yolks, seafood, and red meat also can trigger 
the onset of hyperlipidemia (Price and Wilson 2006). 
 
Research conducted by the Agency for Health Research and Development, in 2013, stated that there are people in 
Indonesia over the age of 15 years had higher levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL above normal, and 
60.3% of them had levels of LDL near-optimal and borderline high (100-159 mg/dl) (Agency for Health Research 
and Development 2013). Some researches suggest that there is a strong correlation between high LDL levels with the 
formation of atherosclerosis (Almatsier  2004).

1962","LDL easily sticks to the walls of blood vessels and cause of plaque and can cause endothelial dysfunction (Diaz et al. 
1997). Antioxidants are known to prevent the oxidation of LDL and increase HDL. The results of this study indicate 
the effect of hyperlipidemia in soybean enriched with rice bran extract can reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels 
to a certain degree. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The results showed that group S-100 can lower total cholesterol and triglycerides after the end of treatment, 
respectively amounted to 95.13 mg/dl and 69.55 mg/dl. Changes in total cholesterol levels during the study in the 
beginning until the induction rose by 57.19% and induction to the end fell by -48.19% positive effect of the treatment 
of S-50 and S-100 lowers total cholesterol levels. As for the total triglyceride levels during the study in the beginning 
until the induction rose by 46.51% and induction to the end fell by -48.42% positive effect of the treatment of S-50 
and S-100 lowering the total triglyceride levels. Decreasing cholesterol and triglyceride levels that can be produced 
from strengthening soybean with black rice bran is expected to improve human health at work. The results of this 
laboratory research, then can be tested on humans and increased to the next stage in the development of food products.

Abstract 
The internet has changed the customer buying behaviour which impact the traditional store practice but provides great 
opportunity for online retailers. The number of online shoppers is expanding at a promising growth rate as the result 
of the increasing of number of e-purchase. However, this is not always followed by the increasing number of repeat 
e-purchases. There are some researches attempt to get more understanding on factors that influence repeat purchase 
intention. But, still few of them are focusing on factors such as customer review and emotional design in relation to 
satisfaction and trust. This study intends to investigate how factors such as satisfaction and trust impact the e-repeat 
purchase intention. The model is an extension of previous model where variables such as satisfaction and trust are not 
considered. This research will be analysed from ergonomic perspective particularly related to the emotional design. 
In this research, data is gathered through online questionnaires. The results from 711 respondents are analysed to build 
structure of a proposed model. The proposed model is then tested by using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) 
method and Structural Equation Model (SEM). The result shows that satisfaction and trust have positive impact on 
the e-repeat purchase intention

1. Introduction 
The growing of Internet has big influence on buying and selling behaviour of modern communities. More and more 
people are now preferring to buy and to sell product or service through online transaction due to reasons such as save 
time, mobility, less effort, efficiency and so on. Nowadays, buyers can choose different options of online stores 
developed by local or international online providers. In Indonesia, for instance, many local and international online 
platforms are available, including OLX, Tokopedia, BukaLapak, Blibli, MatahariMall, Lazada Zalora, eBay, Elevenia, 
and Amazon. Most of those online stores is a typical of online marketplace e-business model where buyers and sellers 
can meet in digital environment to search, buy, display and put prices on the product or service. Another common e-
business model is virtual storefront where product/s directly sold to individual customer or individual businesses 
(Laudon and Laudon, 2000). In this e-business model, customers can search all information about the product then 
place orders by themselves, through an internet transaction. Over the last decade, the number of e-purchasers has 
increase significantly which make online business is more attracting.   
 
The increasing number of e-purchasers, however, not necessarily followed by the increase of repeat purchase. Since 
repeat purchase can bring large potential gain for the e-vendors, it is therefore important to know what factors actually 
influence the e-repeat purchase intention. Several studies have been conducted to find the answer (Chiu et al., 2012); 
(Moriuchi and Takahashi, 2016); (Dewi et al., 2018). Some researchers believe factor such as customer review have 
impact on the buyer’s purchasing decision. Online Customer Reviews (OCR) is an electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) 
in the form of content created in posts on e-vendors or third-party websites (Mudambi, 2010). It is a very important 
information in product purchasing and selling decisions (Chen, 2008) and helps businesses to reach a critical view of 
consumers (Dellarocas, 2003). It is also one information that frequently seek by customers that helps the customer to 
check product or service information before they make the purchasing decision. While OCR is important and has

1968","There is an effect of trust on consumer satisfaction which mean respondents' trust on an online store will also trigger 
customers satisfaction during the shopping experience. This result similar to (Bricci et al., 2016). The trust on online 
stores apparently could give effect on repeat purchases intention. This mean that when the respondent has trusted an 
online store, there is a tendency of customers to repurchase the product /service on online store. Trust could grow 
because of the good visual design of online store. In addition to that, customer who satisfy with the product/ services 
provided by the online store, also affect the customers intention to repurchase the product and service in the future. 
 
6. 
Conclusion 
 
In this section some conclusions are presented based on the finding of the research. First, this research was the 
extension of previous model which aims to find out whether there are any influences of trust and satisfaction on repeat 
purchase intention. The result shows that both trust and satisfaction significantly influence the repeat purchase 
intention. Second, this study is also investigating the effect of OCR on repeat purchase intention by considering trust 
and satisfaction. The result depicts that OCR has no effect on repeat purchase intention since the t-value does not meet 
the criteria. From Ergonomics cognitive point of view, it is concluded that there is an effect of emotional design on 
repeat purchase intention. The test shows that there is an effect of visual appeal on trust and satisfaction which 
influence the repeat purchases intention.  For the future research, it is suggested to assess other factors such as cultural, 
price, place and certain behaviour that influence the repeat purchase intention on online store.

Abstract  
 
Indonesia as a country with a large number of motorcycle users, has a high accident rate where human factors involved 
in most cases. The dangerous behavior committed by motorcyclists is alleged to be one of major reasons of the 
accidents and incidents. Among all possible dangerous behavior carried out by motorcyclists, mobile phone usage 
while riding could bring a horrible consequence to the road safety. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect 
of time period, road density, and rush hour traffic on the use of mobile phones while riding. Field observation was 
conducted to assess motorcyclist’ behavior in using mobile phone while riding. This research observed two level of 
road type based on its density. The observation on each type of road was carried out in the morning, afternoon, and 
evening by considering the rush hour at each observation. The prevalence of mobile phone use among the motorcyclist 
and passengers ranges between 1%~3%. A more detailed results on different observation variables will be discussed 
in this paper.

1. Introduction 
Accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the world where more than 1.2 million fatalities occurred worldwide 
every year on the road (WHO 2015)0. The number of death toll continues to increase to 1.35 million accidents in 2016 
and most accident victims ranging from children to young adults aged 5-29 years (WHO 2018). According to (WHO 
2015) data, there are ten countries with the highest accident rates, namely India, China, the United States, the Russian 
Federation, Brazil, Iran, Mexico, Indonesia, South Africa and Egypt, some of which are developing countries. 
 
Pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists are included in 54% of the death toll from traffic accidents occurred in the 
world (WHO 2018). Approximately 28% of these fatalities were experienced by motorcyclists and Southeast Asia 
became the most vulnerable region with 34% number of fatalities in 2015 and increased to 43% in 2018 (WHO 2015; 
WHO 2018). Traffic accidents not only result in injuries and deaths but also economic losses. The price of a 
motorcycle is one reason of widely used of motorcycle in developing countries, besides the fact that the motorcycle 
is also easier to use, flexible, and can pass through small and dense roads better than cars (Truong and Nguyen 2019; 
Truong et al. 2017). The Indonesian Central Statistics Agency reports that in 2018 there were around 120 million 
motorcycle users out of a total of 146 million vehicles in Indonesia, or approximately 81% of road users were 
motorcyclists. 
 
The Indonesia National Police data shows that most accidents were caused by human factors, following by other 
factors such as poor infrastructure, dangerous environment condition, as well as technical failure of the vehicles. 
Specifically, for motorcycle accidents, the most common cause of accidents caused by driving more than two 
passengers, not wearing a helmet and using mobile phone while riding. 
 
Several studies on the use of mobile phone while riding have been done in some other countries, the results of research 
conducted by (Truong et al. 2016) found that nearly 81% of students in Vietnam use mobile phone while riding. 
(Truong and Nguyen 2019) found that 91.6% of application-based motorcyclist used mobile phone while riding. 
Research by (Pérez-Núñez et al. 2013) showed 0.64% of motorcyclists using mobile phone while riding in three major 
cities of Mexico.

Despite its limitation that the study only covering Bandung area, and bias as a result of manual observation, this 
present study is considered as the first study in the influence of daytime, road density, and rush hour in mobile phone 
use among motorcyclist. Further study in relation to the accident and other possible negative effect of the mobile 
phone use based on these variables are worth to be conducted as an effort to minimize motorcycle accident in relation 
to mobile phone use. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the field study found the prevalence of mobile phone use among the motorcyclist and passengers ranges 
between 1%~3%, and the variables daytime, road density, and rush hour have correlation among motorcyclist and 
passenger. Further research should to evaluate the decrease in alertness using mobile phone while driving.

Abstract 
In the mining company case study, the volume of mining was increasing and the workload of laboratory and 
sample house employees was also increasing. It is important to investigate the physical workload after production 
increasing. The purpose of this study is to analyze and evaluate the physical workload for laboratory and sample 
house (LSH) departments. Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is used to determine the level of the physical workload. 
The job description and the competences of employees will be used to understand, calculate, and evenly distribute 
the physical workload. Furthermore, data is collected through several methods such as discussions, interviews, 
questionnaires, and observation. The result of the study can provide the best strategy for reducing the unbalance 
of the physical workload at LSH and this study can be used to determine the cost and impact of recruiting 
employees based on an analysis of workforce planning as well as for workers, workers can avoid mistakes and 
can work safely. 
1.  Problem Description 
Human resources are the company's main assets in improving the quality of products or services. One of the 
strategies used to achieve effectiveness and efficiency includes increasing the productivity of human resources 
(HR). Human resource management plays an important role in operations in the laboratory. To help companies 
increase productivity, it is expected that all departments in the company are involved in achieving this goal, 
including the laboratory and sample house areas. 
 
In supporting the operations of PT Vale Indonesia Tbk (PTVI), the company has the laboratory and sample house 
to analyze sample mining and process plants (dryer, kiln, furnace, and converter). The sample house serves to 
prepare the sample before it is analyzed in the laboratory. Samples are generally made in powder form. 
Meanwhile, the laboratory is tasked with analyzing all samples of material processed both from the factory 
(process plant) and mining. The main role of the laboratory and the sample house Process Technology is to 
produce reliable, reproducible, accurate, and on-time test results. 
 
In addition, LSH influences the decision making of plant operations in the mining, dryer, kiln, furnace, and 
converter areas. Then, the LSH is required to maintain or even increase productivity as increasing of the number 
of tests and samples in the area. 
 
Therefore, to achieve maximum productivity in the LSH, LSH must understand, calculate, and evenly distribute 
the workload according to the competencies and responsibilities of each employee. Based on research in Slovakia, 
56% of industries consider human resources to increase productivity. Effective workload planning by optimizing 
the capacity of workers must be done to increase productivity (Indrawati et al. 2018). 
 
However, LSH is experiencing several issues regarding workload optimizing. First of all, LSH has an increase in 
workload with a broader spectrum of parameters with an unchanged number of workers (or even a smaller number 
of workers) and must still provide results that are consistent with an increase in turnaround times and of the highest 
quality. Then, increasing the company’s annual production would cause an increase in the number of samples to 
be prepared and analyzed. Based on the results of the Management Review in 2018 and the planned change in the 
volume of work from customer requests in 2019, there is an increase in the number of samples. Table 1 reveals 
the increases in the number of samples between 2018 and 2019:

1979",,"To improve this condition, the company should increase the number of workers for each item according to the 
result of the FTE assessment. Totally, there should be an additional 2 workers at the laboratory. In the meantime, 
the sample house’s workers should recruit 4 new workers. 
 
4.  Concluding Remarks 
According to the research that has been conducted, it can be concluded as follow. Firstly, based on the calculation 
by using Full-Time Equivalent (FTE), it is known that workers at sample house who prepare EFF samples, plant 
(EFM, CS, and Scrap Bin Boat) samples and who take wet-dryer and environmental samples have an overload 
workload with FTE score of 2.91, 1.66 (0.57, 0.72, 0.37), 1.51 (1.06, 0.45) respectively. Meanwhile, the workers 
at the laboratory who do sample exploration smelting workers, x-ray samples as well C&S and xH2O samples 
have an overload workload with an FTE score of 1.68, 1.42, and 1.72 respectively. Secondly, the number of 
optimal workers is obtained from a calculation considering the FTE index. The result generated reveals that the 
company needs 4 workers at sample house, consists of 2 workers of EFF sample, 1 worker of plant sample (EFM, 
CS, and Scrap Bin Boat), and 1 worker of wet-dryer and environmental sampling while at the laboratory the 
company needs 2 workers, consists of 1 worker of sample exploration smelting and 1 worker of Xray, C&S and 
xH2O analyzer. The additional worker must assist in these two areas. Thirdly, with the existing number of 
technicians of 6 people and 8 people at sample house and laboratory respectively, the company needs to recruit 4 
and 2 more workers at sample house and laboratory respectively so that their workers will have normal workload 
according to FTE classification, which is 1-1.28. Finally, the result of the FTE calculation at sample house and 
laboratory can provide the best strategy for reducing the unbalance of the physical workload and can be used to 
determine the cost and impact of recruiting employees based on an analysis of workforce planning.

Abstract 
In a good term, the service sector in this digital era has been altered and influenced by the use of the Internet. One of 
the changes is in the payment option; people nowadays have embraced in a cashless transaction. In such, e-wallet (an 
application in the smart/mobile phone setting) plays its role. As time goes by, the competition in this industry has 
become fierce. To be the first choice for the customers, the provision of an excellent service is essential. In this sense, 
this research aims to analyse the service quality of e-wallet according to the competitive zone of tolerance. It was 
performed by benchmarking against its competitors and prioritizing the service attributes to be enhanced. A case study 
has been conducted to assess the service quality of an Indonesian-based e-wallet application. Result shows that the 
object of the research needs to improve its performance compared to its competitors. Recommendations as a part of 
continuous improvement also provided. This research is expected to provide a company with valued insights into the 
attributes which reflect perceptions of the customers.

Introduction 
In this digital age, the Internet has grown fast to serve millions of users in all parts of the world for a huge number of 
purposes. With more than 40% of the world population or 4 billion users, the Internet has been developed as an 
extremely powerful means that has changed the way people do business. For firms in particular, with the support of 
the Internet, they have adopted the new information and communication technology to support their activities. They 
have tried to advance some competitive advantages interacting with the customers by means electronic commerce (e-
commerce). Most successful firms have recognized that one of the critical success aspects in engaging e-commerce is 
not the website appearance and the low price, but also the quality of electronic service (e-service) (Zeithaml 2002). 
 
Indonesia is one of the largest Internet and mobile users in the world. Around 40% of individuals in Indonesia had 
access to the internet. The popularity of the Internet has increased the number of internet users from 2 million users 
in 2000 to more than 100 million users in 2018. Currently, Indonesians are showing every sign of embracement toward 
cashless transaction solutions. Indeed, there is a wide range of services across the city offering a payment alternative 
to validate the embracement. Without the aid of the Internet, this activity is practically impossible. One of the solutions 
for this cashless activity is the presence of e-wallet. Due to numerous uses of smart (mobile) phones, e-wallet has 
adapted to be e-wallet application. 
 
There are around 38 applications of e-wallet registered in Bank Indonesia. The total value of this new way of electronic 
transactions worth US$ 1.5 billion in 2018, and it is estimated to reach US$ 25 billion by 2023. The Indonesian fintech 
industry led by their own local names. According to monthly active users from Google Play Store and iOS, the top 
five e-wallet applications are GoPay, OVO, DANA, LinkAja, and Jenius. Among the most common services for such 
applications are offline transactions, e-commerce payments, and public transportation. The advantages of using this 
e-wallet application as an alternative in cashless payment method for many users are instant cashback offers and 
additional points. Viewing from the merchant’s side, it is claimed that cashback promos, which range between 20 to 
40 percent, somehow boosted their sales. 
 
In the midst of the intense competition for e-wallet applications, firms experienced several problems related to the 
payment system. According to mediakonsumen.com, from January to October 2019, there were 94 customer 
complaints, including 77 complaints regarding the security of personal data and balances, 14 complaints regarding the

Conclusion 
This study has shown the process of assessing the service quality of an e-wallet application using CZSQ and CZIPA 
diagram. A case study to demonstrate the applicability of the methods also has been provided. The result indicates 
that the assessment has definitely many potential benefits for the manager of the focal firm. There are ten attributes 
(out of 21) that have value of CZSQ more than 0 (zero). It means that the management needs to improve the service 
to be delivered to the customers. To perform a selection in terms of which attributes have to be enhanced so that 
customer satisfaction can be achieved, the focal firm may employ CZIPA diagram to discover how the customers 
perceive the attributes. Notice that not all attributes must be simultaneously improved, because it can decrease the 
enormous amount of finance spent by the service provider. Only the attributes that belong to the first quadrant (and 
have value of d less than zero that immediately are needed to be bettered). Recommendations have been given (see 
Subsection 3.2) for eight attributes located in the first quadrant. The methods, however, are considered uncomplicated 
to be implemented, relatively simple to interpret, and a low-cost solution. It will potentially become benefits for the 
service provider since it assures them to gain valuable insights related to which attributes that are recommended to be 
enhanced based on their importance and performance scores according to the perspective of the customer.

Abstract. 
 
Increasing competency for teacher is necessary, with high competence the teacher can teach well so as to produce 
competent graduates. The X training centre is an institution that has the task of increasing the competency of vocational 
teachers in Indonesia. Education Development refers to the Integrated Tertiary Educational Supply Chain Management 
(ITESCM) model influenced by four factors namely Program Establishment, culture, capabilities, and facilities. In this 
study four construct variables will be investigated in related to education development from the three decision levels 
(strategic level, planning level and operating level). The method used in this study is to use a variance-based analysis of 
Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) that is Partial Least Square (PLS) either partially or simultaneously. The final 
results in this study are, partially Education Development (SL, PL, OL) = 0.007 Program Establishment + 0,409 Culture 
+0,331 Capabilities + 0,312 Facilities, with a simultaneous R-square value of 0.507, this implies that the education 
development variation can be explained by the variable constructs of the Program Establishment, culture, capabilities and 
facilities by 50.7% while the remains 49.3% is affected by other variables.

1. Introduction 
Teacher as educators from early childhood education, basic education and secondary education level has a very important 
role in determining the success of students. Teacher becomes the determinant of the quality education improvement at 
school. The importance of the role of teacher in education is mandated in Laws of The Republic Indonesia (2005) 
regarding teacher and lecturer which behest the teacher training and development as the actualization of teaching 
profession. The term education development in this study refers to the efforts endeavoured in improving the quality of 
educational process and outcomes. Education development comprises pedagogic, professional, personality, and social 
competence. 
 
Referring to a study by Habib and Jungthirapanich (2009), higher education supply chain management comprises of two 
fields namely education and research. Educational supply chain is divided into two: education assessment and education 
development that originally developed by (Habib 2009). This study aims at developing Education Development model 
at the X training centre is a part of, Ministry of Education and Culture of Republic of Indonesia. The educational supply 
chain in Integrated Tertiary Educational Supply Chain Management (ITESCM) model has four variables (Lau 2007) 
which are analysed in this study, they are programs establishment, university culture, faculty capabilities and facilities. 
The four variables will be adopted to create a new model to gain a new overview of education development model using 
educational supply chain at the X training centre. 
 
The study of the X training centre educational supply chain was conducted to examine the effect of each variable to 
education development variable through ITESCM model. ITESCM model was developed by (Habib 2009) with variable 
adjustment: (1) Program establishment or education and training program in the X training centre includes Vocational 
Teacher Competence Improvement Program in the field of technology and engineering from 12 provinces in Indonesia 
with dimensions of training materials, training program structure and time of training, (2) Culture is an organizational 
culture in the X training centre with dimensions of work culture, work ethic, creativity and innovation, (3) Capabilities 
is the capability of educational and service system at the X training centre with dimensions of teaching and service system, 
(4) Facilities refer to all existing facilities at the X training centre used by instructors and participants with dimensions of

is bigger than t-table 1.96 and p value 0.000 < 0,05, with margin of error 5% (two tail), H0 is rejected and H2 is 
accepted. It can be inferred that there is a significant effect of Culture on Education Development partially to the 
three decision making levels (Strategic Level, Planning Level, Operating Level). 
3. The t-statistic value of Capabilities variable on Education Development is 3.940 with p value 0.002. since t-statistic 
3.940 is bigger that t-table 1.96 and p value 0.002 < 0.05, with margin of error 5% (two tail), H0 is rejected H3 is 
accepted. Therefore, there is significant effect of Capabilities on Education Development partially to the three 
decision making levels (Strategic Level, Planning Level, Operating Level). 
4. The t-statistic value of Facilities Variable on Education Development is 5.495 with p value 0.000. Since t-statistic 
5.495 is bigger than t-table 1.96 and p value 0.000 < 0.05, H0 is rejected and H4 is accepted. Therefore, there is a 
significant effect of on Education Development partially to the three decision making levels (Strategic Level, 
Planning Level, Operating Level). 
5. F-count = 37.537 > F-table = 2.434. it can be implied that H0 is rejected and H5 is accepted. It can be concluded that 
there is a significant effect of program establishment, Culture, Capabilities and facilities simultaneously on education 
development to the three decision making levels (Strategic Level, Planning Level, Operating Level).

Based on the results of the path analysis, using linear equations, the SEM PLS model for Education development is: 
Education Development (SL, PL, OL) = 0.007 Program Establishment + 0.409 Culture + 0.331 
Capabilities + 0.312 Facilities. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The equation model obtained from the variance-based Fit model from Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling 
(PLS-SEM) as follows, Education development equation model partially to the three decision making levels (Strategic 
Level, Planning Level, Operating Level): 
Education Development (SL, PL, OL) = 0.007 Program Establishment + 0.409 Culture + 0.331 Capabilities +

1. At the strategic level, planning level and operating level partially tested, stating that Culture is a significant factor 
influencing education development. This means that the implementation of education and training at the X Training 
Centre to produce teachers with high competency strategic level, planning level and operating level must be able to 
create a good culture. 
2. At the strategic level, planning level and operating level that are partially tested, states that Capabilities are a 
significant factor influencing education development. This means that the implementation of education and training 
at x training centre to produce teachers with high competency strategic level, planning level and operating level must 
be able to synergize in good capabilities. 
3. At the strategic level, planning level and operating level partially tested, stating that facilities are a significant factor 
influencing education development. This means that the implementation of education and training at the X training 
centre to produce teachers with high competency at the strategic level, planning level and operating level must 
improve facilities in the implementation of education and training. 
4. At the level of the strategic level, planning level and operating level tested by stating that the Program Establishment 
factors, Culture, Capabilities, facilities. This means that in the implementation of education and training in the X 
training centre to produce teachers with high competency, strategic level, planning level and operating level must 
increase the Program Establishment, Culture, Capabilities, and Facilities. 
 
The problem studied in this study is limited, therefore it is suggested for the future researchers to develop more model, 
for instance by exploring other variables that may affect education development. Thus, it is expected to contribute to

data to find out the most fit method. Lastly, mixed data scale can be used to see the extent of PLS parameter in overcoming 
cases with different data types.

Abstract. 
PT. XYZ is an application-based e-commerce that focuses on selling women’s fashion products. The new business, 
which has been running since 2016 has experienced decrease in sales and profit because of inability to compete 
with its competitor such as Marketplace. Seeing from these problems, the business model of PT. XYZ will be 
evaluated using the Business Model Canvas approach to propose a new business model. Business Model Canvas 
is mapping the business model of a business into nine blocks that explain the general picture of the business in a 
short and easy to understand way, consist of Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, Customer 
Relationships, Key Activities, Key Resources, Key Partnerships, Revenue Streams, and Cost Structure. The nine 
blocks will be analysed and processed using SWOT analysis to find out the business’ weakness, strengths, 
opportunities, and threats. The result of this research is a new business model for PT. XYZ to compete with its 
competitors.

Background 
In this digital age, organizations or companies must always update the strategy taken as an adaptation process with 
the inclusion of the digital era (Flanding et al. 2018). The entry of this digital era also caused an increase in the 
number of internet users in 2018 by 13.3% over the previous year according to (databoks.katadata.co.id 2019). 
The use of the internet forms online shopping activities, namely the activities of buying and selling goods online 
that are felt to provide more comfort and convenience compared to offline stores (Sramova and Pavelka 2019). 
One of the platforms for online shopping is e-commerce, which is the activity of distributing, purchasing, selling, 
and marketing goods and services using the internet and electronic systems (Damanpour and Damanpour 2001).  
 
One example is PT. XYZ which was founded on November 1, 2015. PT. XYZ is an e-commerce that focuses on 
selling women's fashion, such as clothing, veils and women's shoes. PT. XYZ is an application-based ecommerce 
that can be downloaded using an android device. Women's fashion is the brand identity that is used by PT. XYZ, 
therefore PT. XYZ only focuses on women's fashion and does not sell other needs. PT. XYZ applies a membership 
system for its customers to access content on the application, so that non-member customers cannot purchase 
products on the application.  
 
Based on existing data, income received in 2018 decreased by 34.5% compared to 2017. This is due to the growth 
of the Marketplace and people's preferences towards the Marketplace. PT. XYZ must have a value that can 
distinguish PT. XYZ with its competitors. The membership system that is run also makes it difficult for customers 
to reach. From these problems, PT. XYZ needs an alternative business model that can be used to compete with 
other businesses. To discuss solutions, a business model mapping was carried out to PT. XYZ uses the Business 
Model Canvas and SWOT Analysis.

Literature Review 
2.1 Business Model Canvas 
The Business Model is the overall thing that is done and designed by the company to achieve profitable results 
and meet the specified target consumers (Wrigley et al 2016). One type of business model is the Business Model 
Canvas, which is the business model approach of an organization or company by mapping in nine aspects or 
components, each of which explains how the company generates revenue (Osterwalder and Pigneur 2010). The 
Business Model Canvas consists of nine interconnected blocks, that are Customer Segments, Value Propositions, 
Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams, Key Activities, Key Partnerships, Key Resources, and Cost 
Structure. Each block is interconnected to create a business model as shown as in the Figure 1.

Abstract 
One of the activities that can be done to control costs in production activities is by optimizing the level of supply and 
demand. Dynamic Lot Sizing Model is one method to get a minimum inventory level which in essence can reach the 
minimum costs that must be incurred by the company. This model seeks to eliminate the assumption that fixed demand 
level is calculated the same for each period that is commonly used in the EOQ model. This paper considers dynamic lot 
sizing, stochastic demand, by selecting one supplier, each supplier has quantity discount system and also transportation 
cost. In this case, backlogs are permitted, and the standard normal loss function used to represent the standardized unit’s 
number of shortage function. By having an objective function and some constraints where the variables can be integer 
and biner, then solving using MINLP is a good choice for this formulation model, with commercial optimization software. 
Study case performed in manufacturing, and model can help to determine quantity order to purchase, with specific 
supplier and for each period. The goal to be achieved is to obtain the minimum costs from the purchase cost, order cost, 
backlogging cost, handling cost and transportation cost.

Introduction 
Inventory management is very important for a company to achieve competitive costs and to obtain a decent profit in the 
market. It has become a popular topic both in academia and in real practice for decades. As the production environment 
becomes more complex, various types of mathematical models have been developed, such as linear programming, non-
linear programming, mixed integer programming, geometric programming, gradient-based nonlinear programming, 
dynamic programming and also another method such as heuristic tools try to solve the problems more effective and get 
the result, especially when the problems become non-deterministic. 
 
Having good production planning through effective inventory management is important for companies to stay competitive 
in the market. With single item, and many periods are one of the most common and basic problems and are often dealt 
with in the literature. There are various extensions of the model to consider various problems in the real environment. 
 
Inventory storage and backlogging costs incurred to store purchased products and do not meet product needs when 
needed, this is a concern. Therefore, finding the optimal set of suppliers and the number of goods to be obtained in each 
time period, can maintain inventory and reduce costs related to company suppliers.

Literature Review 
In the inventory management literature, the problem of dynamic lot size has received a lot of attention especially when a 
set of planning periods is considered. In 1958, Wagner and Whitin introduced the first dynamic programming algorithm 
to solve the dynamic lot-sizing problem for only one type of product and at one supplier. The next researcher tries to find 
a solution with other algorithms to improve efficiency empirically. The researcher tried several algorithms, starting from 
mixed integer programming, multi-objective programming, genetic algorithms, heuristic dynamic programming or 
others, to get solutions with more efficient solutions (Wagner and Whitin 1958; Evans 1985; Federgruen and Tzur 1991). 
 
Research also develops by considering the backlog and quantity discounts. Other researchers mention that this quantity 
discount has two kinds, namely the quantity discount is based on all products, or the quantity discount is given on

units, and in period 3 from supplier A with 16,302 units. And the optimal solution as a total cost is $243,153.

Analysis 
From the results obtained in table 6, it shows that ordering in the first period to meet needs until period 2, this causes no 
need for a backlog in that period. This also happened in period 3, where orders were made to fulfil the next three periods, 
and so on. Although the objective function states that there is a holding cost and backlog cost, the variables related to 
quantity will indirectly contradict, where if there is a stock, it means that there is no backlog for each period. Thus, the 
results obtained indicate that there is no quantity backlog for each period. 
 
The outcomes of sensitivity analysis are appeared in Table 7. This analysis performed dependent on the optimal solution. 
When the order cost from every supplier (𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖), inventory holding cost (ℎ), backlog cost (𝑠𝑠) or transportation cost (𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡) is 
increase or decrease 50%, the total cost in the framework is changed. For this study case, with decrease of holding cost 
by half, the all-out costs will diminish by 7.06% to 225,991 dollars. From three parameters above, we got that holding 
cost is a significant parameter since that variable can prompt a bigger change in all out expense.

It is significant impact if we expand for the number of quantity discounts price break (𝑘𝑘) for each supplier, include with 
add more suppliers (𝑖𝑖), more periods (𝑡𝑡) and those will make difficult size and may cause the issue to become NP-hard

Conclusion 
Proposes of this paper is develop a MIP model to decide the stochastic part estimating renewal for various periods 
consider over amount limits, different suppliers and service levels. The contextual investigation shows the common sense 
of the model in accomplishing the best fulfilment under different objectives, which are limiting absolute expense and 
fixing the service level. At the point when a recharging issue isn't unreasonably confounded, for instance with hardly any 
periods, suppliers and amount price breaks, a MIP model can be effectively explained by scientific programming, for 
example, LINGO. Nonetheless, when there are numerous periods, a few suppliers and various amount markdown breaks, 
the difficult will become NP-hard and restrictive computerized. As far as we could possibly know, a MIP model, which

2023","considers amount limits, various suppliers and administration level to at the same time limit all out expense and utilize 
the piecewise straight capacity to speak to the normalized number of unit deficiency work, is non-existent. 
 
In addition, the investigation gave in this examination is exceptionally valuable for buyer in planning a recharging 
approach to manage the stochastic part estimating issue which has the attributes of safety stock, numerous suppliers and 
distinctive discount schedules from suppliers. 
 
The proposed MIP model can be custom fitted and applied to other inventory management issues. For future research, 
we can consider an increasingly complete case for flexibly supply chain. A model that considers backorders, delay 
purchases, lost sales, variable lead time, and diverse need of requests can likewise be established.

Abstract 
 
Air Traffic Control (ATC) is a complex cognitive task. The complexity may cause the workload of air traffic 
controllers (ATCs) to increase. Increased workload could degrade operator performance, which further affect safety 
and functioning of the system. Numerous studies in evaluating mental workload in various tasks used physiological 
and biochemical measures, including studies in ATCs. The use of physiological measures in those studies provides 
unique information of the operator's condition. This systematic review summarizes literatures on the measurement of 
the mental workload in ATCs using physiological and biochemical measures. The conducted systematic search come 
up with thirty-four studies to include for analysis. Physiological measures are categorized into cardiovascular, ocular, 
brain, respiration, and skin measures. Biochemical measures consisted of cortisol and salivary immunoglobulin 
(sIgA). The literature review covers various studies either in simulation environment or real working environment, all 
with different conditions and task scenarios. Even though this review specifically focuses on mental workload of 
ATCs, in general, the result of physiological measures still differs between broad studies. The difference might be 
influenced by the study task loads, difficulty levels, and the participants' characteristics.

Introduction 
The nature of work has changed from physical work to demanding cognitive work as the increasing use of Visual 
Display Terminal (VDT) and automation system in many workplaces. The Air Traffic Control is a complex (Nolan 
2011)  and stressful job (Nikolova and Danev 2011). 
 
The increase in traffic density and system automation become a challenge for air traffic controllers. The air traffic 
controllers should be able to sustain their focus of attention over a continuous period of time (Warm et al. 2008). As 
safety becomes the major priority of this task, the performance of air traffic controllers should persist. Therefore, 
mental workload becomes an important variable to investigate user performance (Young et al. 2014). Mental workload 
is often described with terms such as mental strain and emotional strain (Cain 2007). A repetitive simple task may not 
be affecting mental workload, but additional temporal pressure may affect mental workload (Young et al. 2014).  
 
Workload is assessed using three general categories i.e., subjective measure, physiological measure, and performance 
measure. The development of the new technologies in physiological measure encourage numerous researches in 
mental workload. This type of measurement attempts to associate physiological changes with levels of workload. It is 
a natural type of workload index (Young et al. 2014). One of the advantages of physiological measures is the ability 
to provide real-time data. It also offers more accurate reports of mental workload, can be standardized, and compared 
across different studies (Tao et al. 2019). The increase in mental workload requires more cognitive resources, and it 
will provoke several physiological activities in the human body including cardiac activities, brain’s electrical 
activities, eye movement, and metabolic changes (Fairclough and Houston 2004).  
 
Air traffic control tasks required more mental resources than physical since it does not only include visual and auditory 
monitoring but also decision making.  Most of the researchers manipulate the complexity of the task, as an indicator

Abstract 
 
The case of power dominance does exist in the asymmetric relationship. Thus, an asymmetric relationship is generally 
explained as a lack of perceived dyadic equality in the partnership, which is caused by large dissimilarities in several 
aspects. Supply chain tactical strategies that translate the strategic planning into details of operational planning have 
been proven by studies able to improve performance. There are several studies on asymmetric relationship and supply 
chain tactical strategies. However, no study reveals the link of asymmetric relationships with supply chain tactical 
strategies. Whereas, knowing the link of those will support the decision-making on how asymmetric relationships 
must be managed to obtain better performance. Furthermore, this study attempts to fill the research gap through a 
comprehensive literature review. A conceptual framework is derived as the essence of the needs of supply chain 
tactical strategies to improve performance in an asymmetric relationship. The conceptual framework can be a 
fundamental theory for further research in asymmetric relationships as well as the manager’s guidance for decision-
making. Eventually, this research will be continued with a case study to test the conceptual framework into real-world 
and supply chain modeling to implement the supply chain tactical strategies.

Introduction 
There are several cases of successful partnerships in a supply chain that obtain benefits for the individual partner as 
well as a supply chain. For instance, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart work together to establish long-term information 
sharing and price agreement; Microsoft and Dell collaborate to ensure that they have a synergy technology roadmap 
(Handfield and Nichols 2002). Wal-Mart collaborated with Warner-Lambert to obtain the benefit of synergy planning, 
forecasting, and replenishment (Simatupang and Sridharan 2005), Chrysler and its suppliers reduced their cost 
significantly through collaborative relationship (Hartley et al. 2002). General Electric (GE) collaborated with its 
retailers in information sharing for a build-to-order system (Simatupang and Sridharan 2005). However, scholars and 
practitioners acknowledge that supply chain relationships are challenged by power asymmetry, wherein power 
dominance does exist in relationships (Mdarhri and Noureddin 2020; Villena and Craighead 2017). 
 
It is essential to reveal some understandings in supply chain asymmetric relationships because of their significant 
impact on organizations’ performance (Michalski et al. 2018). Furthermore, Nyaga et al. (2013) emphasized that 
asymmetry in the supply chain relationship itself is an important topic for research because some differences between 
partners are unavoidable. The reason is that the supply chain is composed of multiple company interactions. The 
interaction between companies over time is usually more asymmetric, imbalanced, and different (Thomas and Esper 
2010). Thus, studies on asymmetric relationships are increasingly important over time. For decades, most of the 
research on asymmetric relationships only reveals the high-level concept and determine the extent of asymmetric 
relationships. However, there is no study in the asymmetric relationship area, which arranges to discuss supply chain 
detail strategies at the tactical level. 
 
On the other side, research on supply chain tactical strategies is many. They attempted to reveal the determinant factors 
which impact the performance of individual firms or systems (Hall and Saygin 2012; Okongwu et al. 2016). Tactical 
strategy transforms strategic planning into details and becomes a benchmark for operational planning targets. It is also

2038","2014), compensate demand uncertainty by flexible orders, safety stock, and production rescheduling (Vieira et al. 
2003), and reduce communication error by experiencing working together (Pérez and Cambra-Fierro  2015). Thus, 
supply chain strategies are more chosen as a constructive strategy to improve performance. 
5.   
Conclusion and Research Opportunities 
There were a number of findings from literature in asymmetric relationships. First, the asymmetric relationship 
provokes the external uncertainties as exogenous factors (Gupta and Maranas 2003) of strategy decision-making 
(Cendon and Jarvenpaa 2001). Second, the dependent manufacturers in asymmetric relationships prefer a constructive 
strategy rather than a deconstructive strategy to achieve better performance (Pujawan et al. 2014). Third, under 
asymmetric relationships, supply chain tactical strategies are a tool of better performance achievement through a set 
of strategies such as capacity tightness, safety stock, frozen time fence, rescheduling frequency, and information 
sharing. The extensive literature review has been used to construct a new conceptual framework that can answer the 
research question. Thus, the link of exogenous factors that emerge from an asymmetric relationship and supply chain 
tactical strategies in order to achieve better performance is answered. 
This study can fill the gap of knowledge in asymmetric relationships and wherein there is a lack of previous research 
that discusses the detail of supply chain tactical strategy. However, further validations are required to obtain stronger 
arguments. As follow up of this research, the authors will construct a comprehensive case study to the number of 
manufacturers to clarify the validity of a conceptual model. Thus, the phenomena of asymmetric relationships, 
including its exogenous factors and the firm’s supply chain tactical strategies, can be explained in empirical cases. 
Furthermore, in order to prove the theory through a quantitative method, the authors will utilize the simulation model 
to obtain the appropriate strategies’ scenarios on performance.

Abstract 
The use of mobile phones while riding is one of the major causes of road accidents. Despite of its danger, the 
use of mobile phones while riding is still widely found in Indonesia, especially among taxi riders because it is 
perceived as an important and beneficial activity since they rely much on the mobile application to do their job. 
The purpose of this study is to assess the behaviour of taxi riders when using a mobile phone while riding. The 
research was conducted by observing 125 taxi riders in Bandung, one major city in Indonesia. The results show 
that the most activities carried out on mobile phone while riding were the use of GPS (44.8%), sending messages 
(1.6%), and making phone calls (1.6%). Importantly, taxi riders’ response to a telephone call are: 69.6% chose 
to ignore the call, 24.8% chose to pick up the telephone while riding, and 5.6% chose to pull over before picking 
up the call.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia is one of developing countries which relies on motorcycle as a dominant mode of transportation. 
According to WHO data (2013), Indonesia is the 3rd country with the largest motorcycle population in Asia. The 
high number of motorcycles is reasonable as motorcycle offers flexibility and mobility with affordable price. 
Not to mention, technological innovation which led to the emergence of application-based motorcycle is very 
tempting for many motorcycle users in Indonesia. However, the high use of motorcycles in Indonesia is also 
followed by a high rate of accidents. According to the Republic of Indonesia State Police Traffic Corps (2018), 
the highest number of traffic accidents were experienced by motorcyclist, which in 2018 there were 37,059 cases 
with 28,000 fatalities. In other perspective, there are three people die every hour due to motorcycle accidents. 
Injuries, deaths, and losses from these accidents cost around 3% of Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product. 
 
The high accident rate of motorcyclist is caused by several factors. According to the Ministry of Communication 
and Information, the biggest factors causing traffic accidents are the human factors (61%), while there are also 
other contributing factors such as infrastructure and environment (30%) and vehicle factors (9%). Within the 
human factors, one of dominant issues which should be anticipated is the use of mobile phone while riding. 
Research reviews (Pérez-Núñez, et al. 2013) on various modes of transportation show that using a mobile phone 
while driving a car increases the risk of being involved in road accidents by four times greater (McEvoy et al. 
2005). As for pedestrians, crossing the road while using a mobile phone increases the chance of being hit or 
nearly hit by a vehicle (Stavrinos et al. 2011; Nasar and Troyer 2013). Meanwhile, research on cyclists reported 
about 9 to 10 percent of cyclist accidents can be attributed to the use of portable electronic devices, including 
mobile phone (Goldenbeld et al. 2012). 
 
Despite of being categorized as dangerous act, the use of mobile phone while riding is still widely found among 
riders in Indonesia. The results of observations conducted in Bandung, one of major cities in Indonesia, shows 
that the prevalence of mobile phone use while riding reached 42%, whereas the use of mobile phone among taxi 
riders shows twice compared to general motorcyclist. The high use of mobile phone among taxi riders might due 
to the nature of work which often requires them to check mobile phones on the road. In this case, the activity of 
using mobile phones while riding is considered to be a normal activity and is often carried out among groups of 
taxi riders and is an important part of their daily work. The use of mobile phones is also considered a 
communication tool which offers an important advantage in the work routine of this group. 
 
Given the urgency to overcome the mobile phone use problem among taxi riders, unfortunately research related

calls. If the customer disclaimed, then they did not pick up the phone call because they just wanted to ensure that 
they had been with the right customer. The taxi riders who chose to pull over to take the call might think that it 
was the safest method. Meanwhile, the taxi riders who choose to receive the call while riding might perceive 
that it is not a dangerous thing to do because they can maintain their riding performance or ride slower while 
picking up the phone call.

The frequency of mobile phone use as a function of hands-held/hands-free and response to a call can be seen in 
Table 3. Further analysis using the chi-square test shows a significant relation between how to use a mobile 
phone when riding to the response to a phone call (χ2 (4) = 20.651, p = .000, p <.05). The taxi riders who use 
mobile phones by hands are more likely to pick up phone calls, while riders who use the hands-free tools are 
more likely to ignore phone calls. The possible reason to explain the fact is that when using the mobile phone by 
hand, the position of the mobile phone is more convenient to receive incoming telephone calls. Whereas in the 
hands-free situation, the position of the mobile phone will be in the holder so that it will be more difficult for 
riders to pick up incoming phone calls. The interesting finding is that there were some riders who did not use 
mobile phones while riding (kept a mobile phone in a bag or pocket) but chose to receive calls while riding. 
However, the numbers of this group are relatively small.

4. Conclusion 
The most widely used mobile phone usage activity among taxi riders is the use of GPS. When getting a phone 
call, even though most riders ignore the call, there is a tendency that the rider will still pick up the call while 
riding. This present study is the first study in Indonesia which observes the behaviour of taxi riders in relation to 
mobile phone use. Further research needs to be done to investigate the effect of mobile phone use activities to 
the riding performance and or accident.

Abstract 
 
Banking is one sector that has a high risk in its operations. Risk management is an effort to overcome the risks faced. 
Risk management seeks to manage risks to secure firms’ sustainability and to enhance performance. This study focuses 
on the impact of intellectual capital on Indonesian banks’ risk management performance. Intellectual capital is 
knowledge-based capital which is believed to have a strategic role in improving performance. Our research sample 
was 29 banks listed at the Indonesian Stock Exchange. By using the panel data regression technique with the Fixed 
Effect Model to analyze the data, this study demonstrates that intellectual capital affects risk management. In 
particular, structural capital and relational capital affect risk management, while human capital cannot predict risk 
management. 
 
1. Introduction 
Risk management has been recently under increasing attention because many firms cannot manage their risks 
sufficiently that leads to business failures (Lechner and Gazhert 2017).  Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a risk 
management model that identifies, evaluates, and controls risks that potentially threaten firms’ survivability and 
activities. Beasley et al. suggest that ERM as a new paradigm in managing organizational risks and making decisions 
(Baesley et al. 2005). Risk management allocates resources sustainably to increase organizational performance 
(Mohammed and Knapkova 2016). In Indonesia, Banks are required to implement Risk Management effectively both 
for Banks individually and for Banks on a consolidated basis with Subsidiary Companies. Risk management must 
receive attention in banking operations in Indonesia, as stipulated in Bank Indonesia regulations. This regulation was 
compiled and issued by Bank Indonesia as the highest institution in banking regulation in Indonesia. 
 
Sällebrant et al. (2007) propose that increased level of intellectual capital have been associated with risk management 
performance. Intellectual capital is the key to increase firms’ competitive advantage (Chen et al. 2005; Maji and 
Goswami 2016; Hejazi et al. 106). In this respect, knowledge capital is an inimitable asset. Firms will continuously 
develop if they deploy their intellectual capital effectively. A more dynamically and complexly changing environment 
causes knowledge-based resources to be the main asset to preserve firms’ sustainable advantage (Wei and Hooi 2009). 
Modified Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (MVAIC) measures intellectual capital performance (Ulum et al. 
2014). MVAIC itself consists of four components, namely, Human Capital Efficiency, Structural Capital Efficiency, 
Relational Capital Efficiency, and Capital Employed Efficiency. 
 
In particular, risk management positively contributes to firms’ performance with greater intellectual capital (Andersen 
2008). Sällebrant et al.  (2007) find that intellectual capital is negatively related to idiosyncratic risk. The relationship 
implies that intellectual capital helps firms implement risk management that reduces their risks. Thus, This research 
was conducted to determine the effect of intellectual capital on risk management.

2049","The positive impact of RCE on ERM implies that the increased efficiency of relational capital enhances banks’ ERM 
implementation. When banks increase their relationships with their stakeholders, they need to improve their risk 
management. Stakeholders understandably expect banks to manage risks efficiently to protect them from losses when 
they transact with the banks.  
 
This study also demonstrates that CEE negatively affects ERM. The result does not support our hypothesis that 
predicts that CEE positively affects ERM. ERM requires significant costs (Lechner and Gazhert 2017; Sultz 2008; 
Lin at el. 2012). Consequently, when banks need to increase their capital efficiency, then their risk control will be 
affected in the opposite direction.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Intellectual capital positively affects Indonesian banks’ risk management as indicated by the significantly positive 
effect of Modified Value Added Intellectual Coefficient on Enterprise Risk Management.  Also, the components of 
Modified Value Added Intellectual Coefficient, i.e., Structural Capital Efficiency and Relational Capital Efficiency, 
positively affect Enterprise Risk Management. The results suggest that intellectual capital contributes to banks’ 
enhanced risk management implementation. Banks will implement their risk management when they are more aware 
of risks, and awareness will increase when organizational knowledge improves.

Abstract  
 
Currently in business, the retail sector faces a number of problems such as poor or weak business management, 
presence of waste, presence of high inventories, problems with customer service, inefficiency in the work line, among 
others. This research raises the question: What research has been done in the retail sector to know how Lean tools 
could help solve their current problems? The type of research that has been chosen is of documentary design and for 
its development has been used the systematic literature review of twenty-six (26) articles published between 2000 and 
2020, selected on the basis of keywords and which apply the philosophy of Lean manufacturing in the retail sector. 
The results show that the application of the Lean methodology allows for better business management, cost reduction, 
increased productivity, improved customer service, reduced inventories and shorter delivery times.

2056","4. Discussion 
 
In the papers reviewed, Lean tools and continuous improvement concepts have been proposed with different 
approaches and have been applied at some of the stages of the value chain of retail businesses with favorable results.  
Most of the results from the papers reviewed suggest applying tools such as JIT, VSM, Kayzen, 5S, and Poka Yoke.  
 
Lean Principles of streamlining processes, reducing waste, and increasing productivity are valuable and applicable to 
retail operations, especially where efficient in-bound and out-bound logistics processes are of paramount importance. 
However, managers ought to avoid taking a myopic view of lean retailing, as reduction of inventory holdings is not 
synonymous with improvement of operational efficiency. Taken together, the associations of company size and 
demand uncertainty discussed above appear to be useful. (Chuang et al., 2019) 
 
The use of a Lean Principles, and in particular the value stream on identifying waste and its causes, was highly effective 
in quickly identifying a number of opportunities for improvement within company’s value chain. Lean philosophies 
can be used to transform the strategies to address the problems related to inventory, obsolescence, long lead times and 
distribution in the supply chain (Daine et al., 2011; Shah and Khanzode, 2017; Kroes et al., 2018). On the other hand, 
Bashir et al. (2020) shows in the warehouses of a hypermarket the savings in shipping cycle time by 16% and a 
reduction in labor cost by 25% by applying lean manufacturing principles and focusing on seven wastes. 
 
In the same way, JIT has a great impact on general performance (quality, speed, reliability, flexibility, and cost); Poka-
Yoke plays a critical role in performance as it helps prevent and eliminate quality defects whereas Kaizen and 5S have 
a moderate impact on general performance (quality and speed). Lean helps deliver products and services faster at a 
lower cost and inventory (Shah et al. 2017; Maher y Das, 2013). According to Kumar and Kwong (2011), evidence 
that the application of Six Sigma tools is quite effective in streamlining and integrating the process flow in a 
pharmacy's customer service. Additionally, it’s essential worker’s participation in lean projects to increase their 
motivation, to assure an increase in productivity and process efficiency (Jaca et al., 2012).  
 
These are some results from applying lean tools: Bashir et al. (2020) labor cost reduction in 25% for a supermarket 
chain; Speredelozzi et al. (2006) unloading time reduced in about 46% for a retail distribution warehouse; Jaca et al. 
(2012) an increased productivity from 9.06% to 9.96% in the distribution center warehouses; Vignesh et al. (2016) 
and Andrés-López et al. (2015) provide advantageous financial results and excellent customer satisfaction for 
businesses in the services industry. According to research conducted, in practice quantitative effects of lean thinking 
in retail are sales increasing (up to 10 %), labor costs reduction (between 10% to 20%), inventory reduction (Between 
10% to 30 %) and stock-outs (between 20% to 75 %). This significantly affects customer satisfaction and profitability. 
(Lukic, 2012). 
 
Abernathy et al. (1999), the most quoted author, proposes applying Lean techniques in the retail sector through a 
simple work organization – the pull system – to drive replenishment and eliminate bottlenecks and waste across the 
supply chain to improve overall retail performance. Another example presented by the same author, is the change that 
Lean retailing entails, which is forcing apparel manufacturers to rethink the way they interact with their retailing 
customers, undertake distribution, forecast and plan production, and manage their relationship with suppliers. 
 
It is worth noting that the literature reviewed does not include any research in Latin America. All papers are based on 
Asia, Europe or North America. However, Maher and Das (2013) state there are no sufficient Lean tools as effective 
as to improve their relationship with retailers. Both of them are opportunities for future research.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The question proposed in the research herein is proven through the literature review since the businesses in the cases 
studied undertook Lean Retailing as work philosophy and attained a better business management, reduced costs, an 
increased productivity, a better customer service, a reduced inventory and delivery time, among others.

Abstract 
 
In the Aircraft redelivery process, MRO companies often experience delays in the completion of aircraft maintenance 
and repair before being handed over to the lessor (aircraft owner). A study was conducted to analyse the risk causes 
with a systematic risk management approach. The risk assessment study refers to ISO 31000, which consists of 4 
stages: risk-cause identification, risk-cause classification, risk analysis, and evaluation, and risk treatment 
identification. Root-cause and Pareto analysis also used to help to strengthen the analysis and decision making. This 
study was conducted in one of the MRO Companies in Indonesia. From a study of 7 cases of aircraft redelivery delay 
in 2001-2017, it was found that the dominant cause of the risk was late in decision making on new findings of aircraft 
condition, bad data management, bad system planning, availability of materials and workers, and poor quality of 
maintenance work. After the risk assessment process, it was obtained that 6 risks causes need to be reduced, 3 risks 
need to be shared/transferred, and 3 risks need to be accepted. 
 
1. Introduction 
The aviation industry applies very high safety standards to ensure every flight is safe. Flight safety is very dependent 
on the aircraft condition. The aircraft condition becomes a particular concern by each airline as the lessee and lessor 
as the owner of the aircraft when the lease agreement ends. The lessee is obliged to redeliver the aircraft to the lessor 
in accordance with the redelivery provisions (International Air Transport Association 2017). In this series of redelivery 
processes, a Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) company is appointed to carry out maintenance and repairs 
of aircraft. One of the important issues that often occurs is the delay in aircraft maintenance and repair completion. 
This issue has a big impact on MRO companies related to extended work time and cost, penalty fees of late handover 
from the lessor, and disruption of subsequent aircraft maintenance activities. Approximately, there are 80% delay 
occurred in the aircraft redelivery process (Lehri 2019). Since 2010, there has been a significant increase in the aircraft 
leasing business, and it is estimated that this number will continue to increase, because of its ability to remove residual 
value risk, provide alternate financing, increase flexibility in orders, and until recently, enable off-balance-sheet debt 
(World of Leasing Yearbook 2018). Therefore, an effort is needed to improve these conditions so that the risk of delay 
in aircraft redelivery can be minimized.  
 
All types and sizes of organizations have internal and external factors that influence the achievement of their 
objectives. The effect of this uncertainty has on an organization's objectives is “risk”. Which can be measured by the 
likelihood and its impact on the organization (Wang and Hsu 2009). Efforts to systematically minimize the impact of 
risks are called risk management. Risk management has long been an important contributor to most types of 
management and is widely applied in various areas, such as manufacturing, insurance, services, and economics 
(Ritchie and Brindley 2007). The study was conducted in one of the MRO Companies in Indonesia. Documentation 
from the 2001-2017 period about aircraft redelivery delay was analysed. In the literature review process, it is known 
that there are still a few academic types of research that discuss about risk management in the aircraft redelivery 
process. Therefore, this study aims to help the MRO Company to minimize the risk of aircraft redelivery process by 
assessing the risks. The scope of this study includes risk assessment which consists of identifying the risk causes, 
classifying risk causes, analysing and evaluating the risk causes, and risk treatment categorization. Pareto analysis and 
root cause analysis are also used to determine the dominant factors and their causes

In addition, the consequence value for risk causes categorized as a crisis, and high shows a high value. It means that 
the risk cause has a significant impact on the delay in the aircraft redelivery process. International Air Transport 
Association, in its research stated that the redelivery of the aircraft process requires excellent system planning, 
considering that the implementation requires quite a long time and involves various stakeholders and complicated 
processes. Therefore, MRO companies must improve the existing condition to minimize the occurrence of risk causes 
by planning improvements according to risk treatment 
 
4.3 Risk-cause Treatment 
Risk-causes treatment involves selecting one or more options to conquer the likelihood, impact, and the 
implementation of these options (Santos and de Oliveira 2019). This step was carried out through interviews with the 
stakeholders, and it was decided that there were six risk causes that were reduced, three risk causes were 
shared/transferred, and three risk causes were accepted as shown in Table 7. Based on prioritized risk causes, the 
company should focus on solving them by reducing and transferring the risk causes systematically in order to reduce 
the delay of the aircraft redelivery process by 80%. From Table 7, it is known that risk causes that accepted, MRO 
Company can do nothing to solve the problems, for example, the long holiday and long negotiation process because 
they are related to external stakeholders/environment, so it was decided to accept the risk causes.

5. Conclusion 
The principal objective of this study is to identify, classify, analyse, and evaluate risk causes of aircraft redelivery 
delay help the MRO Company to minimize the risk of aircraft redelivery process by assessing the risks and prepare 
risk cause treatment categorization. From the results of this study, it was known that risk causes which dominantly 
happen are late to make the decision about new findings, bad data management, bad system planning, availability of 
workers and materials, and poor quality of maintenance works. This knowledge can be information for managers in 
MRO Company, as well as the other researchers. There are a few limitations of the present study, along with many 
possibilities for future research. This study only applied several steps to form the ISO 31000 risk management 
framework that is related to risk assessment steps. In order to, gain more comprehensive results, future studies could 
apply the complete risk management framework of ISO 31000 and also enhance the risk treatment activity. 
Furthermore, future studies could also analyse the application of integrated risk management framework on lessor 
company, lessee company, and MRO company to obtain the more comprehensive results from all the process that 
related to aircraft redelivery process.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia as a country with a Muslim majority population is very concerned about the halal status of the food 
it consumes, including food in the form of fresh beef. The Indonesian Ulama Council has set the halal standard of 
fresh beef by collaborating with slaughterhouses that are closely monitored by the slaughtering process according to 
the halal standard according to Islamic law, but many illegal beef circulating does not comply with slaughter standards 
according to Islamic law and is difficult for Muslims to distinguish halal beef which is cut according to Islamic law 
and illegal beef. The purpose of this research is to help those who care about halal beef and make it easier for Muslims 
to find out the halalness of fresh beef using block chain technology.

1. Introduction  
 
Cows are a commodity in the livestock subsector. Cows have several types, namely beef cows which produce 
meat and dairy cows which produce milk. Beef cattle are livestock that can support the needs of meat consumption, 
because cows can be raised simply, easily, are liked by many people and their bodies are quite large when compared 
to other livestock. Beef has an advantage as a product, namely as a provider of good nutrition. Beef supply chain 
activities need to be carried out to meet consumer demand which is spread across several regions and is in 
accordance with the halal standards of the Indonesian Ulama Council or MUI. 
The beef supply chain must pay attention to several aspects that can affect the smoothness of the distribution 
process up to the end consumers. Because in addition to meeting consumer demand, the form of regulation in the 
meat supply chain also aims to benefit the chain involved. So that we need an approach to the supply chain system 
in the form of an approach to find out product flow, financial flow, information flow besides the halal standard 
which is the most important thing in the beef supply chain for Muslim community. 
As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, halal products are a necessity for Indonesians. But in 
reality, regular people still have difficulty identifying the halalness of a food and beverage product including fresh 
beef sold in traditional and modern markets because there is no mechanism that can help Muslim consumers check 
the halalness of the beef they will consume. 
 
 
1.1 Objectives  
Taking into account that the majority of Indonesians are Muslim who are very concerned about the halal 
status of the food they consume, one of which is fresh beef and there is no mechanism that can be used for Muslims 
in Indonesia to check the fresh beef they will consume, a way is needed for Muslims Indonesia to know the halalness 
of the fresh beef it consumes. The large number of illegal beef or animal meat that is forbidden for Muslims circulating 
in traditional and modern markets in Indonesia is a strong reason to create a beef supply chain procedure that ensures

Figure 3 describes the overall interaction between all parties involved in the halal beef supply chain using 
the block chain network. As explained in the previous figure, the information that comes from the slaughterhouse is 
connected in a block chain network, which means that any changes or additions to existing fresh beef information 
are protected from illegal beef. Information on halal fresh beef that has been rigorously validated and is 
continuously updated can be used by consumers from the market via the internet using a smartphone or computer. 
The government can also use the information available for government purposes.

Abstract 
 
One of the challenges faced by the food industry when managed supplies are perishable products. Perishable products 
are products that have a short lifetime. A short lifetime will make a decrease in value over time. The problem with 
inventory management for perishable products is how to determine the amount of supply needed to used/stored before 
the product's life runs out and will achieve profit maximization. In this research, an inventory management model 
product will make by doing a renewal process. This model has three inventory phases. Each phase stores a different 
type of product, where inventory in the first phase will change to the second phase through a specific process. The 
renewal process is to change a product in the previous phase and becomes a different product in the next phase. By 
doing the renewal process, the rest of the product from the previous phase can be used and not wasted. The purpose 
of doing the renewal process is to extend product lifetime. The problem in this study will perform in several case 
scenarios that can represent real system conditions. It also can prove that doing the renewal process can provide higher 
profits.

Introduction 
The biggest challenge that will be faced by the food industry that requires the supply of perishable products. How to 
determine the amount of supply needed to be used/stored before the age of the product runs out. The quality of 
perishable products is one of the characteristics that need to be considered in a supply chain (Sahin et al. 2007). Some 
research on inventory management has already done before. The development of an optimal inventory management 
model with consideration of late payments has been carried out by (Sahin et al. 2007; Ibrahim 2018). Ibrahim (2018) 
has also developed a supply model with consideration of gas emissions. Other research determines optimal inventory 
for perishable products with a single vendor and multi buyers system (Chen 2018). Other research states that by 
integrating production and distribution, the results will depend on the level of freshness of the product when 
distributing. How can the minimization of supply costs be achieved, which includes costs incurred due to damaged 
products (Amorim et al. 2012). 
 
Inventory management problems will become more complicated if the product under study is perishable. Perishable 
products have a limited lifetime. The quality of their products will decline from time to time. Duration of time and 
temperature influence the level of freshness for perishable products (Song and Ko 2016). The customers (more than 
50%) would check the expiration date before buying a product (Tsiros and Heilman 2005). In order to guarantee safety 
and quality and produce optimum profits, managers of perishable product supply chains must have a strong 
commitment (Wang and Li 2012). Not all food will improve in quality when stored (except wine and cheese). Quality 
loss detects by smell, taste, touch, or visual. This change happens because of several factors, such as oxygen, humidity, 
light, microbial growth, and temperature (Tanner 2016). 
 
Fresh vegetables that have the best nutrition will obtain when vegetables are harvested and will be reduced over time 
until the vegetables rot. The quality of a vegetable product is worth 100% when the product already sold at normal

2083","This total income obtains from the number of products sold. Because the product in this study is perishable, and the 
level of product quality into consideration. The level of product quality will affect the selling price of the product. 
When the quality of the product goes down, the selling price of the product will also go down. To find out why the 
production costs needed can be lower in the scenario that does the renewal process. Then it is necessary to know the 
cost components included in the production costs, such as holding cost and lost sales cost. Table 9 shows the holding 
cost and lost sales cost result from the numerical calculation.

If the storage costs and the cost of lost sales totaled, then the scenario that does the renewal process will have a higher 
cost. However, if we see which scenario has a more significant advantage is a scenario that does the renewal process. 
This conclusion has resulted from numerical experiments with three different levels of product demand. Even though 
the numerical calculation results without the renewal process have a small lost sales cost, it does not guarantee a 
significant profit.

From table 10 can be seen overall, the purchase costs required in the scenario without doing the renewal process are 
much higher. In the first scenario SK1-2, the total cost required is IDR 182,700,388. When compared with numerical 
calculations using the renewal process, the total cost required is IDR 118,195,216. By doing the renewal process gives 
higher profits because when there is a renewal process that can make savings, savings occur because of buying raw 
materials at low prices and then processed themselves. For example, to make dried chili, fresh chili is needed, which 
is processing by drying. The price of fresh chili and the cost of this drying process is lowest than buying dried chili 
directly.  
 
Likewise, in scenario two, the demand level is increasing. The total cost required for numerical calculations without 
renewal is greater IDR 205,116,475. While numerical calculations with the renewal process get a smaller total cost, 
that is IDR 94,024,661. The same thing happens in the third scenario, where, without doing the renewal process, it 
requires a higher cost.

Abstract 
Green supply chain management (GSCM) is an approach to minimize negative impacts on the environment during 
the construction process. Green material management (GMM) is a phase of the project life cycle that has a significant 
effect on GSCM performance. GMM dimensions consist of green procurement, green transportation, green 
warehousing, and reverse logistics (RL). The application of RL in the construction is difficult because of the lack of 
awareness. The difficulties of RL application because RL not integrated along the supply chain. In construction, RL 
viewed as an independent system. The ease of RL implementation requires performance evaluation as a start to 
determine the initial steps in efforts to improve performance. Previous performance evaluations on GMM did not 
include RL as a dimension in measuring performance, so the purpose of this study is to develop and added an RL 
indicator for GMM performance evaluation. The weakness of the previous research is a measurement not to use a 
quantitative approach. The purpose of this research is to develop indicators and added an RL indicator for GMM 
performance evaluation. The result of this study is a framework of GMM concepts in the construction that consists of 
four dimensions, ten elements, and 38 indicators.

Introduction 
The construction industry is an essential sector in infrastructure development for Shakantu et al. (2008) supporting the 
growth of a country (Luangcharoenrat et al. 2019). During the process of infrastructure development, the construction 
consumes a lot of non-renewable material Wong et al. (2016) which will be emerging a significant impact on the 
environment (Shakantu et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2016). The construction industry produces solid waste (rubbish, mud, 
air pollution, CO2 emissions), and non-solid waste (delay, rework, high cost, etc.) (Wibowo et al. 2018; Wibowo et al. 
2017). The construction of the utilization of 35% of energy will release 40% of CO2 gas into the atmosphere, it shows 
the role of the building in environmental degradation, and it requires more environmentally friendly practices 
management throughout its business processes (Luangcharoenrat et al. 2019). 
 
GSCM in the construction sector has a goal to achieve good quality, cost, time, and environmental performance. 
Therefore, GSCM implementation must be integrated with PLC. The concept of integration is the result of research 
conducted by Wibowo et al. (2018). The GSCM concept with the PLC approach includes green initiation, green 
design, green material management, green construction, and green operations & maintenance (Wibowo et al. 2018; 
Farida et al. 2019; Wibowo et al. 2018). Each phase during the project life cycle will produce different waste, so it 
will need such amelioration through the supply chain to reduce the waste and improve the performance of a 
construction project (Wibowo et al. 2018; Nur et al. 2018).

Abstract 
 
The growing number of digital start-up companies have a significant impact on the industry and economy globally, 
rising a question of how these companies commend their businesses out of intriguing ideas. The role of a business 
incubator in fostering and nurturing digital start-ups is argued to be necessary as business owners start developing the 
ideas. The role of business incubators in developing digital start-ups becomes a question. How may the guidance 
program support the digital start-ups in developing and executing ideas? This study endeavors to elaborate on the role 
of business incubators in developing digital start-up companies using a systematic literature review. We reveal several 
unique insights from the review; the role of a business incubator is not only limited to the digital start-up companies, 
but also the ecosystem. Therefore, business incubators influence the ‘upstream’ to ‘downstream’ of development of 
digital start-ups.

Introduction 
We have become aware that the world has changed with the growth of digital start-up companies. These companies 
have breached many things by changing the map of competition in various industries; for instance, Facebook, Uber, 
WhatsApp, Twitter, with novel ideas to make users feel easier for their life. In Indonesia, we are also observing almost 
the same phenomenon; there are Gojek, Traveloka, Tokopedia, Bukalapak, and Ovo, which have become Unicorn 
digital start-up companies, i.e., start-up companies with a valuation of more than $ 1 Billion. The achievement was 
obtained in a relatively short time, under ten years since the establishment of these companies. In terms of impact, 
with a large number of users, each of these start-ups “disrupts” conventional businesses. A similar question remains; 
how Gojek disturbs the transportation business, how Tokopedia and Bukalapak disturb the conventional market and 
small businesses, how Traveloka disturbs the travel business, and how Ovo disturbs wallet and payment mechanism. 
These so-called revolutions have become pro and contra for many parties, ranging from businesspeople, users, to 
regulators. 
 
Furthermore, there is an interesting issue that can be explored, when these digital start-up companies start ideas and 
seek for potential users, they are faced with the choice to develop their company self-taught or learning from a business 
incubator. By learning from the business incubator, of course, it is expected to increase their knowledge until the 
digital start-up companies are finally ready to plunge into their operating industries. From the business incubator side, 
are they ready to provide the right experience or guiding program for the digital start-up business makers? It might be 
that the guiding program has played an essential role in developing the digital start-up company’s plans to develop 
ideas and continuous improvements to “hit” other industries. In Indonesia, the number of business incubators is 
increasing from 2009 until now. Examples of the business incubators (and accelerator) in Indonesia are Kejora 
Ventures, Indigo Creative Nation, GnB Accelerator, Kolaborasi. 
 
Based on the described phenomenon, how is the relationship between business incubators and digital start-up 
companies may promote beneficial conditions? In other words, what are the roles of business incubators? This research 
identifies the role of business incubators in fostering digital start-ups. We argue that the roles have a significant impact 
on the start-ups so that they can take advantage of the guidance program provided by the business incubators. We 
focus on systematically exploring previous studies to examine the literature. The systematic literature review (SLR) 
has been used to provide an analytical overview of the current knowledge and examine the research theme under study 
(De Araújo et al. 2017; Arviansyah et al. 2011). The SLR is acknowledged in the academic community to offer an

Abstract 
 
Indonesia has always been a lucrative market for e-marketplace and classified ads development as the country has 
both a large population of youth and stronger economic growth. However, e-marketplace and classified ads are still 
highly associated with fraudulent acts. According to the POLRI report from January to July 2019, there were 1.243 
cases of fraudulent activities and this condition worsened the trust in using e-marketplace and classified ads. This 
condition also makes the perceived risk and negative review in using e-marketplace and classified ads to increase. The 
decrease in confidence also has an impact on price dispersion increasing perceived risk and ultimately makes the 
perceived value by the community to change. So, based on this phenomenon, this study aims to formulate the 
conceptual model of the relationship between initial trust, perceived risk, price dispersion, perceived value and e-
WOM toward the intensity of transaction. This study uses several models from previous authors as a reference to build 
a conceptual model. Thus, this study proposes a new conceptual model consisting of eight variables for e-marketplaces 
and classified ads. The findings of this study are to build a conceptual model to determine the relationship between 
variables for further research.

Introduction 
The advent of internet technology has made the development of C2C (consumer to consumer) e-commerce grow very 
rapidly throughout the world (Dan 2014). The growing development of e-commerce business also has an impact on 
the increasing number of online fraud cases that occur every year starting from 1993 (Renjith 2018). Indonesia is one 
of the countries experiencing e-commerce developments, both e-marketplaces, and classified ads.  
 
E-marketplaces are defined as internet-based business facilities for buying and selling on a website, where there are 
third parties whose job is to direct and be neutral (Janita and Javier 2013). The surveys to 2,026 Indonesian consumers 
which is conducted by Dailysocial.id (2019) collaborate with JakPat indicated that Shopee is the most preferred e-
marketplace service at 34%. Then Tokopedia 28%, Bukalapak 17.5%, Lazada 14%, Blibli 2.15%, and the rest are 
other e-marketplaces totalling 4.31%. Besides e-marketplaces, selling on stalls or social media providers is also very 
popular in Indonesia. Selling at stalls and social media providers in the field of e-commerce are called classified ads. 
Although both are selling in online stores, in classified ads, the stall providers do not interfere in the transaction process 
(Eko 2013). The data indicated that, in Indonesia, the most preferred classified ads are OLX, mamikos, rumah123, 
mitula, and others (Similarweb 2020). The survey conducted by APJII mentioned that Facebook (50.7%) is the most 
visited social media respondents. It is followed by Instagram (17.8%), YouTube (15.1%), Twitter (1.7%) and LinkedIn 
(0.4%) (Dailysocial.id 2019).  
 
The many e-commerce sites that have arisen in Indonesia has increased fraud cases. Countries in Asia are reported as 
the countries with the highest fraud rates, especially Indonesia and China, which reached 22% in 2008 by Rofiq and 
Joseph (2010). Based on Kaspersky Lab and B2B International's research results, 26% of consumers in Indonesia 
become victims of online fraud and the study calls Indonesia as the country with the most victims in the world

Abstract 
 
The current distribution system is highlighting supply chain resilience concerns in the business competition. Related 
to it, the Indonesian government prioritized in retail data collection and management of retail distribution systems 
(traditional and modern) to deal with the business competition. In terms of supply network resilience, the aspects of 
decision-making behavior will have a significant influence. This study aims to build an initial decision-making 
framework in traditional retails. This research developed a framework using primary data collection from surveys and 
interviews and secondary data through literature studies and theories directly related to traditional retails behavior. 
The framework will represent traditional retails decision-making behavior in pricing strategies, action behavior, retail 
performance, and distribution selection. 
 
1. Introduction 
One of the challenges in Indonesia's economic sector is managing supply network resilience for traditional retailers. 
The configuration of the economic policies of the retail and market sectors states that there are urgent needs in the 
structure and data collection of the modern and traditional retail, in the absorption of local products, and the 
improvement of the distribution system. This condition becomes a big concern of the government and business people, 
especially for traditional retailers. 
 
The definition of resilience is the ability of the system to react to unexpected disruptions and restore normal supply 
network operations (Disraelly et al. 2003; Christopher and Peck 2004). Under dynamic conditions, the supply chain 
network is strongly influenced by conditions inside and outside the system all the time.  Supply chain resilience studies 
state that disruption in this concept is an operational part that will affect network resilience (Christopher and Peck 
2004; Jüttner et al. 2003; Tang 2006; Kovács and Tatham 2009; Zhao et al. 2011). 
 
One of the important reasons for measuring supply network resilience is the relationship between network resilience 
and business competition performance. The concern of the company in the current global competition is the existence 
of supply chain disruptions, including operational and financial risks (Craighead 2007). According to the results of 
the Logistics Performance Index measurement issued by the World Bank in 2018, the highlights problem of the current 
distribution system concerns over the resilience of the supply chain network to maintain business competition. 
 
The problem needs to be concerned about is the distribution system to maintain and improve the performance of 
traditional retail businesses. Asosiasi Pengusaha Indonesia (APINDO), well known Indonesian businessman 
association, states that the distribution of stores or retails in Indonesia in 2017 is dominated by traditional retail, which 
is 82.3%. This data shows that traditional retail is still growing very well in Indonesia. The habit of consumers making 
small purchases makes them always rely on traditional retailers (Blanco and Fransoo 2013). The dominance of 
traditional retailers has the potential for weak business competitiveness. Hence, supply network resilience becomes a

5. Conclusion  
This study produced a framework for traditional retail behavior in decision-making. Traditional retailers have the same 
selling price strategy through unit-based costs. In the next process, retailing does the learning process for its 
operational existence by adjusting price changes that occur over time. From these two processes, transactions between 
retail and consumers occur in action behavior. Business performance is built using business profitability calculations. 
The final process is the procurement of goods through distributor selection and replenishment policies. 
 
This research is limited to the concept of behavior based on an initial survey of several traditional retailers. The use 
of empirical data, more transactional data, and appropriate advanced methods are expected to explain the impact of 
traditional retail behavior in distribution network systems. In addition, linkages with other stakeholders are still needed 
for future research.

traditional retail uses the number of ordering policies in normal conditions, so the calculation uses equation (7). The 
third possibility is ordering goods based on the number of sales of the previous period. Retail uses consumer demand

In the process of determining the distributor requires a utility function. The utility function will express traditional 
retail satisfaction with distributors. Preferences are defined as sets P = {p1, p2, p3, … pn}, where pi is the value of the p 
index preference to i. In this study, each individual has an attribute score on preferences. 
 
From interviews with traditional distributors and retailers, preferences narrow down to trust relationships, services, 
and distributor prices. Of these three preferences, there will be 23 types of traditional retail preferences, so there are 
eight possibilities of preference, as shown in Figure 3. ""Very good"" trust shows personal closeness (such as kinship) 
between distributor and retail, while ""normal"" shows a close relationship limited as a seller (distributor) with a buyer 
(retail) only. ""High service"" services are additional services offered by distributors, such as the arrangement of goods, 
and return service for defective products, whereas for ""normal service"" are services without additional services. In the 
price preferences, there are two types, namely (normal) market prices and below market prices. 
 
Based on data collection from 30 traditional retailers, the tendency of traditional retail behavior is narrowed to three 
types as in Table 2.

There are 59% of traditional retailers (18 out of 30 retailers) have type 1 preferences. This type is a characteristic of 
traditional retailers who have a preference for ""very good"" trust relationships - ""high service"" services - ""normal"" 
prices. Based on the results of surveys and interviews, this character explains that the relationship of trust (with 
distributors) and service has more value than price. According to traditional retailers, this character has an important 
role in building and maintaining their business models while still providing normal prices on the market. Through 
trust, disturbances in the procurement process are easier and faster to overcome. This behavior is then translated in 
the form of a utility function.  
 
It is necessary to calculate the proportional score yi of the individual attributes by the evaluation function, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖=
𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖−𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∈[0,1] and pi is the value of the p index preference to i.  From each calculation of yi  then given a weight 
of 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖. The formulation is as follows: 
𝐹𝐹= ∑𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1
(𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖. 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖)|𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖= 𝑓𝑓(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖)

Each traditional retail will have different satisfaction because each traditional retail has a different weighting 
preference value. Traditional retailers will decide or choose a distributor based on the highest utility value.

Abstract 
 
One of the objective measuresof mental workload is through respiratory method. Respiration is a physiological process 
mainly related to the exchange of O2 and CO2 from body tissues to the air. The aim of this study is to  review  
respiratory method and mental workload research for developing cognitive workload measurement methods based on 
a literature study. As acknowledge by authors, there are 28 studies using respiratory approach, with 13 parameters in 
which the respiratory rate parameter is often used. There are 7 domains and 1 nonspecific domain about the studies.  
From the literature review, considering its advantages, the respiratory seems to be a promising approach in the study 
of cognitive workload measurement in particular in Indonesia due to its low cost and practical reasons.  
 
1. Introduction 
Recently, the characteristics of work in industry and daily activities has shifted from physical activity to mental 
activities. This change is triggered with the development of industry 4.0, which is characterized by the massive use of 
internet and cloud system. In addition, the changes also involve cognitive abilities (for example thinking, 
remembering, and making decisions) in a large extent. The need of cognitive abilities to fulfil the job demand in recent 
activities raises the issue of cognitive load. The cognitive workload, which is defined as the difference between work 
demand and worker’ cognitive capacity, (Gopher and Donchin 1986) has become an important issue in recent years, 
in relation to the efforts to improve the performance of the systems. The term cognitive workload sometimes 
interchange with the term of mental workload in some studies. Maintaining the optimal cognitive workload will ensure 
the optimal performance. Too low of cognitive workload (i.e., under load) will cause boredom and decreased 
performance (for example, increasing vigilance decrement). In contrast too high of cognitive worklaod (i.e., overload) 
will causes errors as well as work accidents. Therefore, measuring cognitive workload is very important. 
 
Measuring cognitive workload should fulfill some criteria. According to O'Donnel and Eggemeier (1986) cognitive 
workload measures should sensitive (i.e., can differentiate  the level of cognitive workload on the same job), acceptable 
(i.e., accept by the respondents), diagnosticity (i.e., can distinguish sources of cognitive workload variation and the 
contribution of each source the total cognitive workload), not intrusive (i.e., does not interfere with the work or activity 
to be measured or the workload to be measured), , and minimal equipment (i.e., using minimum equipment so that the 
measuredoes not  affect the performance of the respondent). 
 
Measuring workload can be done subjectively that is through the assessment of employee questionnaires that are 
measured at the end of the activity, for example Rating Mental Effort Scale (RSME, Zijlstra and Van Doorn 1985, 
Widyanti et al. 2013), Subjective Workload Assessment Technique or SWAT (Reid and Nygren 1988), and NASA 
Task Load Index or NASA-TLX (Hart and Staveland 1988). It can be done objectively as well, using a physiology 
approach such as using heart rate variability or HRV (Widyanti et al. 2013), Galvanic Skin Response or GSR 
(Widyanti et al. 2017) and electroencephalograph or EEG (Rahma et al. 2020). Both subjective and objective method 
have their own advantages and disadvantages.

2138","electroenchepalograph/EEG (Rahma et al. 2020). Thus, the respiratory approach is relatively new in the study of 
cognitive measurement in Indonesia. 
 
The RR parameters of respiratory are often used.  Brookings et al. (1996) state that the increased respiration rate may 
have been a direct effect of the increase of metabolic demands required to perform the task. Furthermore, the RR is 
the most useful of the respiratory measures for MWL measurement (Roscoe 1992). RR was found to be the most 
sensitive measure in the present study, which increases significantly with the additional cognitive load under all 
conditions tested. 
 
Considering the high need to measure cognitive load in both laboratory and industrial settings, as well as the practical 
advantages of respiratory measures, this measures seems promising in measuring and optimizing cognitive load in 
Indonesia.  
 
5. Conclusion 
RR and TV are indicators of respiratory approach that is often used. The respiratory approach is relatively new in the 
study of cognitive measurement in Indonesia.

organization supported by Information Systems, including Operational Management, Tactical Management, and 
Strategic Management. The purpose of this study is to analyse the research on measuring the effectiveness and 
efficiency of Information Systems at each level so that it can be known the business value of Information Systems. 
The method used is to collect literature relating to the effectiveness and efficiency of Information Systems. We group 
existing domains based on the organizational level. From the results of the literature review, three measurement groups 
can be considered. This literature review provides new research opportunities to take measurements based on existing 
theories and prove measurements that are appropriate to the organization. 
 
1. Introduction  
Establishing an appropriate information system (IS) and evaluating the success of IS is very important these days, 
given the need for companies in various fields to be superior and efficient. Developing methods and techniques for 
assessing the value of Information Technology (and IS) is a difficult and challenging task (Sethi et al. 1993).  
 
There has been a lot of research done by making models and frameworks for conducting evaluations to determine the 
value of IS businesses. Kun proposes a framework for the realization of business value during the deployment of 
enterprise information systems (EIS) (Kuna 2014). This framework uses a holistic approach, in which the application 
of EIS investment to the organization is expected to shorten processes and minimize resources so as to drive customer 
performance and increase revenue. 
 
Measurement or assessment of the business value of a company must consider the strategy, goals and objectives of 
the organization itself. Assessments that are not related to the organization's strategy, goals and objectives need not 
be used (Hamilton and Chervany 1981). For example, someone who is going to measure body weight can use an 
analog or digital scale, and it is not recommended to use a vegetable scale because the measurement is not appropriate. 
There are different management levels in an organization that are distinguished by the objectives of each level. This 
study wants to focus on approaches to effectiveness and efficiency based on organizational level to find out IS 
Business Value. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The study of the theory discusses the basic theories and concepts related to research in order to obtain a theoretical 
construction foundation as a guide and benchmark of research. The theoretical studies of this study include 
Organization’s Level and IS Measurement. 
 
2.1 Organization’s Level 
Information Systems are not just hardware and software used by users, but more than that, Information Systems are a 
unity between technology, organization, and people who cannot be separated from one another. Information systems 
can provide value for an organization by providing solutions to existing challenges.

5. Conclusions 
This study examines the measurement of the effectiveness and efficiency of SI based on the level of the organization. 
Each level has a different purpose. Therefore, measurement of effectiveness and efficiency must be in accordance 
with the object to be measured. From the review literature examined, researchers found the appropriate variables at 
each level. Operational management is measured based on operational effectiveness and efficiency. Tactical 
management is measured based on decision making effectiveness and efficiency. Strategic management is measured

Abstract 
 
Transformation in the manufacturing industry followed by the development of globalization, requiring 
performance improvements along the supply chain. Supply chain management is one of competitive strategy to 
enhance the company’s productivity and profitability. Supply chain management maturity models is present to 
propose the best practices in supply chain management. A basic idea from these models is that increased maturity 
will improve supply chain performance. This study investigates the relationship between supply chain 
management maturity and supply chain performance based on the five key supply chain management maturity 
dimensions consisting of strategy; asset and facility; human resource; information and technology system; and 
process areas provided in SCOR model derived from previous literature. They were collected by web-survey from 
relatively manufacturing industry in various company size. The study results may be limited by the size of 
collected sample. The research framework and hypothesis in this study were tested using Partial Least Square 
approach. The results specifically highlight the contribution implementation of supply chain management maturity 
which can improve supply chain operational and supply chain organizational performance. This study provides 
useful planning information in the manufacturing industry.

1. Introduction 
The manufacturing industry has experienced changes in recent years, including management change, 
technological processes, customer expectations, supplier attitudes, competition, and other aspects. Current global 
economic trends with liberalization by all countries in the world have significantly reduced trade barriers. The 
biggest impact is increased trade in the manufacturing industry so manufacturing companies are more 
competitive. Globalization, specialization, and ownership in various components of the supply chain in the 
manufacturing industry have become increasingly complex and extensive in the fields of logistics and inventory 
as well as other related matters related to customer satisfaction. Because of this change, manufacturing 
companies are required to support the market and promote competitors by increasing the speed and efficiency of 
shipping, and must be able to produce the goods needed by the global market by ensuring the best quality. 
 
Supply chain management offers a management philosophy for managing activities and integrating upstream 
and downstream parties and the company's internal supply chain (Ross 1998). Supply chain management is 
identified as a strategic tool for companies to improve performance and ensure their competitiveness. From some 
literature can be summarized into several points of definitions (Handfield and Nichols 1999; Cooper et al. 1997; 
Mentzer et al. 2001) 
 
First, supply chain management views the supply chain as a single entity that requires cross-functional 
integration in an organization and across companies in the supply chain. Second, supply chain management aims 
to improve the performance of each company as well as the entire supply chain. Third, companies must establish 
and maintain the practical management such as integrated behaviour, information sharing, mutual risk sharing 
and appreciation, cooperation, common goals and the same focus in serving customers, process integration, and 
building and maintaining long-term relationships. Although the definition of SCM itself leads to a supply chain 
integration, in practice this has not been achieved much. Therefore, the improvement of SCM implementation 
becomes very important in the manufacturing industry to provide better customer service.

2152","5. Conclusion and Implications 
This paper has provided empirical study that identifies two SCM maturity and describes the relationship among 
SCM maturity, operational performance and organizational performance within the context of manufacturing 
industries. It sought answers to the main research questions that is how the level of maturity of SCM practices 
in the manufacturing industry is. 
 
The current implementation of supply chain management concepts in manufacturing companies is shown in the 
results of a survey that shows the level of maturity of each application of supply chain best practice. From 57 
results of the questionnaire that have been processed show that the average level of implementation of the 
implementation of supply chain best practice is in the development stage and there needs to be some 
improvement in some practices. For companies engaged in the manufacturing industry, attention should be 
directed more towards the factors of increasing cooperation and collaboration both in terms of internal and 
external with suppliers and customers, as well as increasing the use of information technology at all sizes of the 
industrial scale. Data for the study were collected was tested using partial least squares method, which is a 
structural equation modelling approach. Based on previous literature, SCM maturity were grouped in five 
dimensions: strategy, asset and facility, human resources, ICT, and SCOR process. The results indicate that five 
factors of SCM maturity dimension have direct positive and significant impact on operational performance and 
also organizational performance. In contrast, the relationship between the two performance-constructs was found 
direct positive effect but not significant effect on organizational performance. 
 
The present study has some limitations, the most serious limitation of this study was its small sample used in 
this research. Data is collected from one respondent in an organization that might be a cause for response bias. 
The next research is expected to be able to increase the number of samples so that the indicators have good 
validity and reliability and can provide a better picture tangible to the objectives and issues in research. It is 
hoped that future research can provide input on how to evaluate the maturity level of supply chain management 
practices in the form of a framework design that has been adapted to the current condition of manufacturing 
companies in Indonesia, so that it can be used as an appropriate reference for other manufacturing companies 
when implementing a supply chain best practice. Future studies can also investigate the proposed relationship 
by integrating some contextual variables into the model including industry type, supply chain structure, and 
length of the supply chain.

Abstract 
 
The level of sales becomes the most important thing in the Rosella Baru Sack Factory and recently there was a decline 
in sales levels in the company in 2019, this declining sales level is an obstacle to the development of the company. 
Besides, the Rosella Baru Sack Factory has also shown the customer relationship with the quality of services and 
products through employee agility, employee professionalism, and facilities that provide comfort, but have not yet 
had a significant impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 
how much relational benefits, service quality, and product quality on customer satisfaction and loyalty for the future 
to be input to the company. And data were collected by questionnaire with 31 customers of the Rosella Baru Sack 
Factory. The analysis technique in this study uses Partial Least Square (PLS). The results showed that product quality 
had a significant positive effect on customer satisfaction and had no effect on customer loyalty, and other results 
showed that relational benefits and service quality also had no effect on customer satisfaction or loyalty. This research 
is important to be conducted as an input for stakeholders to determine the role of relational benefits, service quality, 
and product quality on customer satisfaction and loyalty.

1. Introduction 
In the field of agriculture and plantations, the distribution of goods cannot be separated to deliver these goods to a 
place, namely plastic bags. Aside from being economical, easy to obtain and practical, plastic bags also have the same 
functions and benefits as jute bags. Not only that, plastic bags can also be designed according to your wishes, so they 
can be printed according to the wishes of the manufacturer and more practical. So, after all the plastic sack business 
is very promising for an agricultural country that is full of production in agriculture and plantations, call it sugar, 
coffee, cocoa and others. Businesses also need to compete and find new ideas to be able to develop their business, one 
of the ideas is to retain old customers compared to finding new customers. The cost of acquiring new buyers can be 
five times more expensive than the costs of maintaining old customers. 
 
Choi and Matilla (2009) states that loyalty is the key to the success of a business. New customers are no guarantee to 
bring profit and success to a company. The profit, success, and sustainability of a company can be continuously 
improved through loyalty (Parsa et al. 2005). According to Etemad-Sajadi and Rizzuto (2013), loyalty is the impact 
of satisfaction. Giese and Cote (2000) states that satisfaction is a response from consumers, which means the 
assessment that a product (goods) or services can provide a pleasure for the users of the goods or services when using 
the goods or services. Giese and Cote (2000) states that satisfaction is the impact of several factors, namely Product 
quality, Service quality, and Image. Product quality consists of various kinds, namely variations in goods, appearance 
of goods, and taste of goods. The factors contained in Service quality such as fast service, friendly service, skills, and 
service behavior affect Satisfaction. Views or consumer information about goods or services can be seen through a 
symbol, also called Image. Consumers who buy goods or services can be created if consumers have a good image of 
an item or service (Malik et al. 2012).

trusted. 
 
Based on the results of the hypothesis test in Table 7, of the seven research hypotheses, only one can be accepted 
because it has a positive and significant path coefficient, and six of the research hypotheses are rejected because they 
have a significance level of more than 0.05. 
 
Based on the results of the analysis that has been done, the formulation of this research problem has been answered. 
The analysis shows that there is a positive and significant relationship between product quality and customer 
satisfaction, which means that product quality has a significant effect on customer satisfaction. While other hypotheses 
are rejected and have no influence with each other.

This is also supported by the company which says that plastic sack is a supporting material or packaging material of 
a company and indeed the timeliness is very calculated, but not with the quality of service, if the quality of service is 
improved not necessarily the customer will be loyal or satisfied with the company because most customers of PT 
Rosella Baru are more concerned with product quality than service and because service costs are charged to the 
customer, it can be used by companies to improve product quality, which makes service not important in the eyes of 
customers. And with improved product quality, of course, customers will be satisfied and even loyal to the company. 
 
5. 
   Conclusions 
Based on the analysis and discussion that has been carried out, it can be concluded that relational benefits and service 
quality do not affect satisfaction or customer loyalty, for product quality variables have a significant positive effect 
on customer satisfaction but do not affect customer loyalty. In this study also concluded that customer satisfaction has 
no effect on customer loyalty. This is possible due to factors outside of loyalty itself, such as forced situations that 
cause customers to buy products in the company because no other company sells similar products or customers buy 
products on a need basis.

Abstract  
This study aims to develop a distribution optimization model for bulk and package products of cement industry from 
cement plant until the store customers in Java and Bali market regions area. In distribution model, 2 cement plants, 5 
packing plants, 6 virtual distribution centers, and 128 market areas are included. The transportation mode types are 
ships and trucks. Linear programming will be used to develop proposed distribution optimization model. The main 
objective of proposed model is to minimize supply chain costs of production and distribution system in this case study. 
The improvement recommendation also will be declared to reduce supply chain costs from plant until customers. The 
implication practices of this study is the supply chain manager could plan and manage the production and distribution 
of bags and bulks cement product from cement plant until customers that has minimizing supply chain costs. As for 
the potential reduction in supply chain costs, it can save up to Rp49.6 Billion if existing allocation compared to optimal 
allocation and also recommendation to stop operation of packing plant due to low production utility.

1. Introduction 
Supply Chain Management is an important concept in the world of business and logistics, especially that experienced 
by companies that work together to create product distribution to reach the final consumer. The first time a product 
is provided by the manufacturer or factory, then the distribution of products is continued by the distributor to the 
agent and the last is the consumer (Pujawan and Geraldin 2009). Companies always strive to increase value through 
efficient supply chain management, and one of the easiest ways to increase value is through increasing volume while 
reducing waste through reducing operating costs. 
 
One of cement companies in Indonesia owns and manages all cement plants from production to distribution process. 
One of cement distribution is from the sales area in area A and has supply facilities in the form of a cement plants, 
packing plants, grinding plants, sea ports, and virtual distribution centers. Cement distribution in area A uses ships 
and trucks for transportation modes. Ships are used to transport bulk cement from cement plants to the packing plants 
as a transshipment facility. Meanwhile, trucks are used to transport bag and bulk cement from cement plants, packing 
plants, distribution centers to the marketing districts. 
 
In existing condition, the company makes deliveries through direct shipping and through distribution center facilities, 
packing plants and cement plants. Deliveries are made through the cement plants to the packing plants, distribution 
centers and marketing districts. Bag cement is delivered from the cement plant to the virtual distribution center as a 
transshipment facility. Meanwhile, bulk cement is delivered from the cement plant to the packing plant . Bag and 
bulk cement delivery is also carried out directly from cement plants to marketing districts. Cement delivered from 
virtual distribution centers and packing plants to marketing districts are bag and bulk cement.  
 
Distribution problems that occur are the lack of management of distribution costs due to ineffective allocation of 
cement distribution and lack of collaboration and coordination between departments involved in production and 
distribution to monitor and evaluate costs arising from cement allocation to each marketing district, which creates a 
burden on cement distribution cost in area A reached almost 14% or equivalent to 2.19 Trillion Rupiah of the 
Company's Principal Expenses in 2018. 
 
This study is more focused on distribution problem bag and bulk cement products in area A. The improvement of the

6. Conclusion 
This study has identified cost types in production and distribution model for cement industry. The most affecting 
decision variable in optimization models making to reduce supply chain cost is the volume of cement that is delivered 
from the cement plant to the packing plant. Meanwhile, the most affecting constraint is the transshipment balance. 
The optimization model produced two results. First is supply chain costs reduction from the existing condition 
allocation. Second is recommendation to stop operation of packing plant due to low production utility. Therefore, 
there will be supply chain costs decreasing and production utilities increasing at certain facilities. There is also a 
change on bag and bulk cement volume allocation from supply facilities to marketing districts. The limitations of this 
study that this study does not consider lead time, terrain difficulties, and truck availability. Lead time is not used in 
this study because it tends to be relatively fixed. Terrain difficulties is not used in this study because cannot be 
controlled by the company. Therefore, it is very possible to include them at future research.

Abstract 
In this paper, the problem to be resolved is how to choose a strategy to supply additional heavy equipment needs to 
meet the needs of limestone by considering economic aspects. The company recently have conducted limestone 
mining in three locations:  A, B and C. It is estimated that by the end of 2020 limestone reserves in the Area A will be 
exhausted, and hence all limestone must be gotten from Area B and Area C. The transport distance from the blasting 
area to the crusher area is getting further away. The impact is that the needs for heavy equipment, particularly dump 
trucks and excavators, are increasing. The alternative for fulfilling heavy equipment that can be identified are 
explained as follows: doing investment for the need of additional heavy equipment, rent of additional heavy 
equipment, choosing mining services contract. Based on the lowest Net Present Value or Present Worth of Cost 
calculation, it can be concluded that the alternative chosen to supply additional heavy equipment is through a mining 
service contract.  The company will get another benefit, namely not needing to provide a large investment cost up 
front. The company can distribute the burden of investment cost into operational cost.

Introduction 
PT X is an industry engaged in cement production with a production capacity of 8.9 million tons per year. Limestone 
is a mining material which is the main raw material for cement production. It reaches 80% of all raw material 
requirements. The mining process takes place in three locations. It is estimated that by the end of 2020 the limestone 
reserves in the Area A will be exhausted, and hence all limestone must be met from the Area B and Area C. 
 
The distance of limestone transportation from the blasting area to the crusher area is getting further away while the 
volume moved is the same. Consequently, the need for heavy equipment, particularly dump trucks and excavators, 
increases. If the increase in heavy equipment needs is not fulfilled, the volume of limestone transported will be lower 
than before because the previous average distance was less than 1.5 km, but it changes to an average of 2.2 km. 
Increased demand for heavy equipment must be fulfilled. Otherwise, the need for limestone cannot be met, and 
production target of cement cannot be achieved because the main raw material for cement production is limestone. 
The initial alternatives for fulfilling machines that can be identified are as follows: 
1. Do investment for getting additional heavy equipment. 
2. Rent additional heavy equipment with permanent operational controls at PT X. 
3. Contract some mining services. 
 
Regarded to those alternatives, it is necessary to do an economic analysis to get the best solution that has the lowest 
cost. Based on the background of the study, it can be formulated that the problem is how to choose a strategy related 
to heavy equipment supplies to meet the needs of limestone raw materials by considering economic aspects.

Based on the lowest Net Present Value or Present Worth of Cost calculation, it can be concluded that the alternative 
chosen to supply additional PT. X heavy equipment is through a mining service contract. Low Net Present Value 
is contributed by lower labour and maintenance costs. The company also does not need to provide investment costs. 
The company will get another benefit, namely not needing to provide a large investment cost up front. The company 
can distribute the burden of investment cost into operational cost. The sensitivity of the selected alternatives can be

Abstract 
 
The role of stressors is recognized as critical for human resource development and management issues where it can 
have an impact on occupational stress and performance blue-collar employees in the pharma manufacturer division. 
The employees themselves developing various kinds of stress factors that may interfere with the implementation of 
the work. According to these conditions, the role of an organizational change related to work pattern hours, shift 
handover and workdays is an unavoidable policy of management change. This study was conducted to determine the 
effect of several stress factors, especially for the policy of management change on occupational stress and performance 
blue-collar employees in the production division. The outcomes of Smart PLS 3.2.9 path model revealed findings for 
blue-collar employees (360 respondents) role in the organization significantly correlated with employee’s stress (T = 
3.305; p-value = 0.001) and also significantly correlated with performance (T = 3.268; p-value = 0.001). The indicator 
that has the highest factor loading value of the role of the organization is the work pattern hours. A negative 
relationship was established between stress to performance of blue-collar employees.

1. Introduction 
Research related to work stress that affects the performance of workers is increasingly being done.  Work conditions, 
resources, characteristics, and social environment of an individual can become stressors which trigger in an 
occupational stress (Baba et al. 1998). Job stress is a condition of tension experienced by employees in the face of the 
work that can affect emotions, and conditions of a person's thought processes. Emotions and conditions of thinking of 
workers are influenced by experiences that tension of job stress at work. Job stress can be caused by several sources 
of problems, for example is the conditions at work. Narayana and Lakshmi (2000) informs that comparisons of 
stressors and coping techniques are reported on different types of occupations. 
 
Management of work stress is a challenge for organizations to increase productivity and improve employee health 
which will indirectly reduce health costs, so in this case the handling of occupational stress is a serious problem that 
must be done. Dulger (2009) prove that there are six OSI (Work Stress Indicators) sources that are valid in measuring 
work stress, namely career and achievement, relationships with others, organizational roles, organizational structure 
and climate, intrinsic to the job and home / work interface. Card (2002) distinguishing stressors consists of six types, 
namely Relationships in the organization, Career Development, Personality Factor, Factors Intrinsic to job, 
Organizational climate, and also Role in the Organization.

5. Conclusions 
The desire of companies to change working hours patterns and eliminate shift meetings requires further study. Based 
on the results of the analysis on blue-collar pharmaceutical employees obtained a significant effect on employee stress 
which has a negative effect on performance. This allows the study to optimize the pattern of working hours that are 
appropriate to maintain employee morale in achieving company targets specifically related to productivity.

Abstract 
 
Sustainable Green Supply Chain Management (SGSCM) is a development of supply chain management activities with 
meet 3 main factors in its realization namely economic, social, and environmental. Supply Chain Management is an 
important strategy that supports in improving the overall performance and key of determinants of competitive 
advantages for companies. Adds the concept of ""Green"" to emphasize the importance of environmental issues and the 
need for environmentally friendly systems. To find out more about SGSCM, an evaluation or measurement must be 
carried out on it. Moreover, the measurement of supply chain performance in companies becomes very basic as a basis 
for determining the direction of company improvement. The study was conducted at PT. XYZ, one of the furniture 
company in Semarang, which so far has never measured supply chain performance. The measurement of supply chain 
performance is carried out by the SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) method by first looking for the weight 
value of SCOR performance attributes with ANP (Analytical Network Process) methods.

1. Introduction 
The industry process has an important role in the Indonesian economy. Some industrial sectors are the main sources 
of state revenue, one of which is the furniture industry. Indonesia is one of the biggest furniture exporters in the world, 
along with China, Italy, Vietnam, and Malaysia. 
For facing the competition in this industry, it is a challenge for companies to carry out their production activities. 
Along with increasing government regulations and increasing public awareness in environmental protection, the 
companies cannot ignore environmental problems if they want to survive in the global market (Van Hoek, 1999).  
 
As one form of the company complies with environmental regulations for the sale of products for some countries, 
companies need to implement strategies to reduce environmental impacts. Integration of environment, economic, and 
social performance to achieve sustainable development is a major challenge for today's business competition. 
Companies are also required to think creatively in implementing competitive strategies by producing goods/services 
that are of higher quality, cheaper, and faster than competitors. 
 
Implementation of SCM in recent years Improves movement because the environment is becoming a global issue in 
the manufacturing industry. It cannot be denied because industrial activities also contribute enough to cause 
environmental pollution that can damage the environment. The development of the industry and consumer’s concern 
for the environment is increasing and the issue of the concept of an environmentally friendly industry has been 
enhanced by the concept of the green industry in each of its business processes, which later developed into Green 
Supply Chain Management (GSCM). GSCM is a supply chain management concept integrated with environmental 
aspects which are complemented by product design, supplier selection, material procurement, manufacturing 
activities, packaging activities, product delivery activities to 3 consumers, and management of the use of end products 
(end-of-life products) (Sundarakani et al. 2010). GSCM strives to eliminate or minimize waste (energy, gas emissions,

9. Discussion and Conclusion  
The supply chain operations reference model (SCOR) is a management tool used to address, improve, and 
communicate supply chain management decisions within a company and with suppliers and customers of a company. 
The model describes the business processes required to satisfy a customer's demands. It also helps to explain the 
processes along the entire supply chain and provides a basis for how to improve those processes. The model integrates 
business concepts of process reengineering, benchmarking, and measurement into its framework. Therefore, it is a 
complete model for corporate's; inbound/outbound logistics, manufacturing, distribution, and after-sales operations.  
 
The ANP method is solved using a super decision package. In this method, benefits, opportunities, costs, and risk 
factors are considered separately and weightage for each merit is provided based on the company’s strategic policies. 
The measurement of supply chain performance with the case of PT. XYZ providing recommendations for 
improvement to improve supply chain performance in accordance with the GSCM concept.

Abstract  
This paper is a review of boiler maintenance technologies currently used in the main power generation plants in 
South Africa, Sasol (coal fired plants). The poor maintenance of the boilers at these plants has been the main cause 
of shortage of power due the boiler breakdowns, while the demand of energy usage remains a necessity for 
households and businesses. At Sasol Synfuels power station in Secunda, the use of soot blower cleaning technology 
has contributed a lot to failure resulting in unplanned outages, with high cost of maintenance. A recently published 
paper discusses the design of an acoustic horn and its beam as an alternative technology that may be a better solution 
either to be used along with the current soot blower technology or independently for  new design of boilers. In this 
paper the regulations for maintenance of pressure vessels in South Africa governing the maintenance of pressure 
equipment are reviewed for the case of the boilers at these power plants. South African National Standards (SANS), 
American Standards of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) and American Petroleum Institute (API) are the used 
international standards in supporting pressure equipment regulations (PER) and Occupational Health and Safety Act 
(OHSACT).

1. Introduction  
Coal fuel and natural gas is part of every power plant in generating electricity. These fuel types are used by power 
plants to power boilers, which are known to produce ash. The ash forms slag deposits over the tubes running though 
the boilers. The slag affects the efficiency of the boilers due to the poor heat exchange or high pressure drop. The 
cost to the company is very high in buying the coal for firing up the boiler that does not reciprocate efficiency that is 
relative to the coal used because of the slag and failure of current cleaning techniques. Sasol Synfuels Power Station 
in Secunda consists of 17 boilers in total (9 boilers at eastern side and 8 boilers at western side). Each produce 560 
t/h at 42.50 bar high-pressure superheated steam [1, 2]. Each boiler contains a box of steel tubes [2]. The tubes 
convey the water by means of natural circulation passing the furnace from the bottom upwards turning converting 
water into steam. Energy is transferred from fire in the furnace to the water (radiation, conduction & convection). 
The fire is from burning coal. The soot blow system provided on each boiler is used to blow ash off the boiler wall 
tubes (short soot blowers) and the super heater and convection tubes (long soot blowers). High-pressure (HP) steam 
is taken from the HP steam outlet, reduced to ± 1000 kPa and is blown inside the boiler to remove the ash. Air from 
the Primary Air system is used as a cooling medium to keep the soot blowers cool when not in use [3, 4]. The 
objective of the project is to design an acoustic horn cleaner to be used in cleaning a boiler whilst it is operating with 
a small vibrating beam as an alternative solution to minimise soot blower use. 
2. Literature Review 
Any component designed and manufactured to contain fluid under pressure equal to or greater than 50 kPa is a 
pressure vessel and is regulated using Pressure Equipment Regulation (PER). The boilers at Sasol falls under 
pressure vessels as they operate at HP steam of more than 1500 kPa and their soot blowing system operates at more 
than 1000 kPa. There are different regulations applied in the maintenance of these boilers depending on the type of 
equipment/piping and their category according to hazard category as specified by SANS. Their classification of 
pressure equipment is according to the level of risk taken from the design pressure and the volume of the medium it

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
• 
It is recommended that optimizations be performed on the acoustic horn to reduce material wastage and 
hence not over design the horn. 
• 
It is recommended that the maximum force and stress is will not be used as this can affect longevity of the 
beam as to strong stress and force, therefore, to much vibration will Couse the beam to fracture quicker and 
easier.  
• 
If the beam does not remove the any slag and soot because vibrations are to low the multistage horn device 
can be used as well as to increase the frequency delivered form the horn.  
• 
It is recommended to place the horn such that the vibration get distributed evenly throughout the beam. 
• 
Instead of brittle material such as cast iron any ductile material can be used as it can also be cost saving and due 
to its ductility and malleability as well it can be very effective.   
5.4 Validation  
It is recommended to construct this design and a field test to be done to see if it works. Although this is a conceptual 
design, it would be helpful to do a model of the acoustic horn. 
6. Conclusion  
Using good practice of engineering regulations and national standards, a design of an acoustic device can be used a 
solution/alternative to minimize breakdown costs for coal fired power plant.

Abstract 
 
Drowsiness appears in situations of stress and fatigue unexpectedly and inconveniently. It may 
be produced by sleep disorders, certain types of medications, and even boredom because of 
driving for an extended period. The sleeping sensation reduces the level of vigilante, producing 
dangerous situations and increases the probability of an accident occurring. Those in the prime 
of their lives are particularly vulnerable, with road injuries the leading cause of death among 
those 15-29 years old. The results in terms of damage, injury, and death can be only as permanent. 
Drivers who are tired and sleepy have delayed reactions and make bad decisions. This study 
intends to develop a device or a system that will help drivers in minimizing road accidents. The 
review uses the concept of the Human-Computer Interaction and Usability Test as it follows the 
maximization of the ease, efficiency, and safety of the product and also to have well-designed 
software that has a sizeable impact on learning time, performance speed, error rates, and personal 
satisfaction.

1. Introduction 
Road traffic injuries and deaths have a terrible impact on individuals, communities, and countries. They involve massive costs 
too often overburdened health care systems occupy scarce hospital beds consume resources and result in significant losses of 
productivity and prosperity, with deep social and economic repercussions. According to the 2016 report of WHO, 1.24 million road 
traffic deaths occur every year. This makes it the number one cause of death among those aged 15-29 years. This number is 
predicted to increase to around 1.9 million by 2030 and to become the seventh leading cause of death if no action is to be taken.  
 
The anti-sleep driving alarm for people doing all night drives as well as security guards and others we have to sit in one 
place for long periods of time without any stimulating interaction. The newest high-tech way to stay awake is good whether you 
ever have to drive back home after an exhausting day at work or just need to get something done and sleep is not an option. This 
trusty sleep alarm will keep you at full alert and is always ready to help if your head dozes off.  This has the potential to save lives 
on the road. Long-distance lorry drivers can fall asleep by driving too long hours due to the pressures put on them to get the goods 
to their destination at certain times. This item has the potential to keep them awake or at least to tell them when they are overtired 
and need to stop driving. 
 
This study intends to develop a device or a system that will help the driver in minimizing road accidents. 
 
1.1 Problem Statement  
 
Driver exhaustion is a significant variable in an expansive number of vehicle accidents. Late insights assess that yearly 
1,200 deaths and 76,000 injuries can be credited to weariness-related accidents.  Less attention leads the driver to be distracted 
and the likelihood of a street accident goes high. Drowsiness-related accidents have all the earmarks of being more serious, because 
of the higher speeds involved distraction and the driver being not able to take any avoiding activity, or even brake, before the 
accident. The improvement of innovations for recognizing or preventing tiredness of the driver is a significant test in the field of 
an accident preventing systems. Because of the danger that that drowsiness presents on the road, strategies need to be created for 
checking its influences. Loss of awareness because of tiredness causes a few changes in the human body and activities. These side 
effects and parameters empower us to effectively measure the drowsiness level. 
 
Every year, 1.25 million people around the world die due to road crashes – a global problem that the World Health 
Organization (WHO) says is both predictable and preventable. Most of the victims come from low and middle-income countries.

5. Recommendations and Conclusion 
 
 
The analysis and design of driver drowsiness detection and alert system are presented. The proposed system is used to 
avoid various road accidents caused by drowsy driving.  
 
At the end of the study, the researchers have attained the main objective which is the prevention of road accidents caused 
by drowsy driving. It is attained by supporting the specific objective, the researchers were able to develop a device that will help 
the drivers to stay awake and alert while driving through the use vibrating device.  
 
Considered the facts mentioned in Discussion in V Section it is concluded that the hybrid method that the researchers 
proposed for drowsiness detection is more suitable than the detection techniques which consider only one category of 
measurements such as physiological, behavioral, or vehicle-based methods  
 
As a recommendation for this device, the researchers recommend improving the system by: 
• 
Providing LED to display the heart rate of the driver because when we are falling asleep or feeling drowsy our 
heart rate changes, it will go down and the sound alert will enter. 
• 
Sound alert that is attached to the device to notify the drivers when their heart rate is dramatically changing 
due to drowsiness or sleepiness. 
• 
Changing the materials in manufacturing this device materials that can handle any situation for example using 
rubber as the case of the device so that when the drivers accidentally hit it with another object and create the 
impact it will not break.

Abstract  
 
The Business owner is facing the same problem and looking for a solution to survive in the Covid-19 Pandemic 
situation. The massive movement from traditional to digital done by many businesses to hang on. The movement 
becomes the only one make sense strategy in this situation. Nevertheless, the problem is not all of the business types 
suitable for being digital. Moreover, many small businesses and traditional businesses do not have enough resources 
to become digital.  Refuse to death, some traditional small businesses in Indonesia, trying to find out the other solution. 
Could the business survive or slowly dying to death? What is the survival strategy that uses in traditional business? 
Using a case study on a small traditional food business, namely Pempek MINIAMPERA, this research aims to 
determine how this business could survive during the pandemic? The shocking finding from the MINIAMPERA is 
that the business is not moving their activity to digital but could create maximum profit at a stable rate. This research 
provides the detail of the survival innovation strategy implemented by MINIAMPERA that called as personal 
neighborhood selling approach strategy. Because of the research done in the traditional food business, the strategy 
may be different and not suitable for other kinds of business and different countries with different cultures from 
Indonesia.

2234","5. Conclusion  
Based on the research result, MINIAMPERA as small traditional food business have good selling performance during 
the Covid pandemic. This is shows that the opportunities to survive during the Covid for traditional food business 
without rely on online platform is possible. The alternative strategies could be chosen besides massive digitalization 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. The challenging situation could be managed when the business owner puts all the 
business's passion and effort. A case study of MINIAMPERA shows that in the pandemic, this business could running 
well and get specific growth in profit and customers. The soft entrepreneurship skills and analysis skills that own by 
the owner already save the company. This is proof that creativity and innovation are the keys to manage the business. 
In that way, every entrepreneur or business owner needs to learn and maintain their creative spirits. An entrepreneur 
who always finds ways to survive, using innovative and creative solutions, and then harmonizes with the environment 
and culture called creativepreneur. The research finding also support the previous research’s result in traditional food 
business that online platform as sales cannot replace the offline channel. The online platform act as addition to them 
rather than substitute (Zhang et al., 2019) . by understanding about customer’s perspective on what they really concern, 
the effective strategy could be build by the owner of MINIAMPERA.  
The innovation strategy that implement by MINIAMPERA, combine personal selling and local culture. That could 
be called as personal Neighborhood selling approach Strategy.  The result finding in this research could be improve 
by examine more and break down the aspect of personal neighborhood approach strategy. The next research also 
could looking for the requirement needed to implement this strategy. Base on the assumption, this strategy could 
give different effect to different culture that different with Indonesia (West Java) cultures.

Abstract 
 
This research presents the analysis and comparison of two river crossing alternatives in terms of their impact on the 
on the city’s urban traffic demand by means of implementing simulation models. While the first proposed alternative 
considers the construction of a bridge, the second one is limited to the use of medium-size ferry to transport vehicles 
across the river. The work is carried out following a 4-stage methodology: analysis, design, construction, and 
validation. The virtual models’ construction is based on the classical 4-step travel forecast model. First, a base model 
to simulate the actual traffic flow is constructed, calibrated, and validated. Starting from it, two new models are 
developed, the first one to simulate the construction of a bridge, and the second one to simulate the implementation 
of a ferry line. Realistic restrictions are considered for each proposal: vehicle capacity, travel time, boarding time, and 
departure frequency, etc. Simulation results and statistical tests reveal that the bridge-based model has a significant 
impact on the travel time. Whereas the ferry-based model does not have such impact. In conclusion, the approach 
based on virtual models’ simulations proved to be an useful tool to compare the impact of different river crossing 
alternatives.

1. Introduction 
Modern cities always attract people looking for new opportunities and better living conditions. The concentration of 
the population in large cities is a phenomenon that has been observed during decades. Unfortunately, it is often 
common that the existing infrastructure is not prepared to satisfy the housing and mobility needs of the newcomers. 
The growing number of vehicles on the streets gives rise to traffic congestion problems in the busiest districts, usually 
in downtown and wherever private vehicles and city buses share routes. Of particular interest are the cities crossed by 
rivers, where the presence of bridges is crucial for connecting popular districts. The access to those bridges is typically 
where traffic jams will appear during the hour of high demand. This is the case of Valdivia, Chile. The city is crossed 
by rivers and counts with four bridges to interconnect the city. Since the construction of new bridges is currently under 
study, it is interesting to study different alternatives to interconnect the city across rivers using transport simulation 
techniques. The present work analyses two river crossing alternatives: a bridge and a ferry. 
 
1.1 Objective 
Analyze the effect of new river crossing projects on the urban traffic of Valdivia by means of developing and 
comparing macroscopic simulation models. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1 Traffic Simulation  
There are three mayor approaches for simulating urban traffic: microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic. The to be 
used will depend on the scope and motivation of the study. While microscopic simulation focuses on the behavior of 
individuals, the macroscopic simulation considers the entire flows (Figure 1).

6. Conclusion 
Considering the effort involved in the preparation of OD matrices, the update coefficient is of great help to extend 
their useful life. However, it does not consider the impact of new infrastructure projects as it was seen during the 
validation of the base model. The selection of the right number and proper location of the control points is crucial to 
collect enough data for the calibration and validation of the base model.  
Difference in the simulation results of the proposed river crossing alternatives suggests that the models can adequately 
forecast the travel demand between zones. 
The ANOVA analysis reveals statistical evidence of differences in travel time when a new crossing structure is 
incorporated to the existing road network. However, a post-hoc analysis reveals that only in the case of the bridge-
base model the travel time reduction is significant, whilst the ferry-based proposal does not.

Abstract 
 
This research presents the analysis and comparison of prediction models for the market price of real states by means 
of applying machine learning schemes based on artificial neural networks (ANN). Three prediction models are 
developed, each considering a particular set of attributes and a different ANN architecture. The research is carried out 
following a 4-stage methodology: analysis, design, construction, and validation. To construct the prediction models, 
228 real estates are considered. For each property, 35 attributes were documented. The dataset was split into 2 files. 
The first one containing 80% of the data for training and testing purposes, while the remaining 20% is left for 
validation. To reduce the uncertainty, a cross validation strategy was applied. All prediction models are finally 
compared by means of the error measures MAPE, MAE, and RMSE. In all cases, prediction results present a MAPE 
between 14% and 16%. In conclusion, the research revealed promising results when machine learning schemes are 
used to predict real estates’ market prices. pricing model.

1. Introduction 
The dynamics of real estate markets have always had a profound impact on the sales prices of listed properties, which 
are influenced by both objective and subjective aspects. Commonly, a property’s sale price differs greatly from its tax 
assessment. Among the objective aspects are the construction materials, area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, 
location, etc. Some of the subjective aspects are, on the other hand, architectural style, surroundings, exclusivity, etc. 
Before buyers get involved in a negotiation it is a common practice to ask advice from a realtor with enough experience 
to determine a fair price for a property. However, real estate market is often highly speculative and susceptible to 
market conditions and even to trends. Therefore, sales prices can fluctuate significantly depending on the knowledge 
of the realtor, the ability to negotiate and the conditions of the local market. The situation of global economy might 
also have an impact on this sensitive market as the conditions to obtain home loans varies too. For these reasons, it is 
interesting to explore the potential of artificial intelligence tools that by means of applying models based on machine 
learning algorithms allows to determine the right sale price of a property. 
 
1.1 Objective 
Apply artificial intelligence tools to help determine the right sale price of properties in Valdivia (Chile) by means of 
implementing prediction models based on machine learning schemes such as artificial neural networks. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1 Machine learning schemes 
Machine learning schemes are algorithms used to find patterns in data sets through experience, without the need of 
explicitly programming code. There exist supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms. 
In supervised learning algorithms the training is done using labeled datasets that contain the response or class to be 
predicted. In unsupervised learning, instead, the desired response or class is not known. In the reinforcement learning, 
on the other hand, predefined actions, parameters, and final values are used. 
There are different machine learning algorithms, which are usually grouped as follows:

be found in the literature.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Gaining a good understanding of the local real estate market during analysis stage the is crucial for the development 
of prediction models. To incorporate the preferences of buyers for specific districts, the zoning proved to be a useful 
tool to compare and weight the sale price of the square meter across the city.  
The definition of a wide number of attributes to characterize the listed properties make possible to build prediction 
models based on different criteria. For instance, both regression and correlation analysis can be used to decide whether 
to include or exclude certain attributes or independent variables that are not statistically significant. 
The availability of separated dataset for training and testing and for validation make possible to determine if the models 
can predict adequately when a set of unknown data is used. The application of cross-validation technique helps 
eliminate the bias caused by an unfortunate partition and therefore, it helps reduce the uncertainty of the result by 
means of performing multiple iterations. 
Finally, the resulting error measures from the validation dataset suggest that prediction models based on artificial 
neural networks can be a useful tool to help estimate the sale price of a property using an objective criterion based on 
multiple attributes.

Abstract  
 
Humanity is facing an unprecedent sanitary crisis. Vaccination campaigns at large scale are being carried out all over 
the world. This research analyzes and compare two supply chain virtual models that simulate a stratified vaccination 
campaign in central southern Chile. In the first model the gravity model is applied to locate distribution centers. In the 
second model, the criterion of service distance is applied to locate distribution centers. Both models have identical 
three-echelon configuration with 1 supplier, 5 distribution centers and 20 vaccination points. Simulation results 
revealed that in first model, distribution vehicles travel 14,300 km to deliver 2.48 million vaccines, having a 0.33-day 
lead time with a fleet of 8 vehicles. In the second model, vehicles travel 21,050 km to deliver 2.48 million vaccines, 
having a 0.83-day lead time was 0.83 days with a fleet of 13. In both cases, 5 distribution centers are and 100% of the 
vaccines are delivered on time. In conclusion, simulation results suggest that virtual models for simulating supply 
chain models can be useful when planning vaccination campaigns and making decision about resources’ allocation.

1. Introduction  
The world is facing a pandemic at a scale never seen before. Scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and governments 
are working tirelessly to save lives. Meanwhile, vaccination campaigns are being planned and quickly implemented 
to immunize population and to maintain the crisis under. However, sanitary infrastructure and medical resources to 
satisfice a growing number of infected patients are limited. To make things even more complicated, vaccine 
development and testing take a long time. And when a vaccine is finally approved for use on patients, mass production 
and distribution pose new challenges.  
During the past year governments from all over the world have been working on contracts with pharmaceutical 
companies to provide enough vaccines for their countries. But with a limited production capacity and an enormous 
demand, vaccines are expected to be supplied in rather small lots over time. Since it is understandable that a complete 
population immunization will take a while, governments have developed stratified vaccination plans to saisfied the 
demand gradually. 
Vaccination plans face innumerous difficulties to be implemented successfully. In the first place most of the countries 
have scheduled restrictions such as total or partial quarantines to restrict people’s mobility and so, vaccines will have 
to be sent wherever people are. On the other hand, high risk groups must be prioritized and provided with doses 
quickly to overcome their exposure to the virus. However, transporting vaccines from factories to temporary storage 
locations and from there to vaccination points sets another challenge as, in most cases, the product must be kept under 
strict climate conditions and tracking protocols. 
During the last decades, the application of supply chain management methods has gained attention and interest in 
different fields outside the classic industrial engineering field and health care systems are a good example of that. 
Therefore, it is interesting to develop supply chain simulation models to study the effectiveness of a vaccination plan 
when different approaches are adopted. 
In this investigation, a stratified vaccination plan for central southern Chile is analyzed by means of implementing and 
comparing two supply chain virtual models. In the first model the gravity model is applied to locate the distribution 
centers where the vaccines are temporarily store before being delivered to the vaccination points. In the second model,

Although not visually clear from the previous figures, actual roads and highways are considered during the simulations 
to estimate the traveled distance (Figure 10). 
 
6. Conclusion 
This work presented in simple terms the application of optimization algorithms commonly used in industrial 
engineering and operations research to a real-world problem of crucial importance nowadays. Two distinctive 
approaches were adopted to model the supply chains and proper performance indicator helped visualized objectively 
the advantages and disadvantages of each proposal. 
In conclusion, even though both proposed supply chain models allowed complete the vaccination campaign 
successfully, differences were found in their efficiency. The supply chain based on the gravity model proved to be 
more efficient in terms of transportation costs by a margin close to 30%. Although often laborious, the implementation 
of virtual models for simulating supply chain models can be useful when planning vaccination campaigns and making 
decision about resources’ allocation.

Abstract 
 
This research presents a simplified methodology to develop rapid macroscopic traffic simulation models that can be 
used study reduced areas or districts with high traffic congestion. In contrast to the classical macroscopic approaches 
that require large amounts of data and a large-scale implementation model, the proposed approach focusses on a 
manageable area instead to trying to cover the entire road network of a city. For the purposes of the investigation, the 
subject of study is an area of high demand with access to a bridge that connect two populated districts of Valdivia, 
Chile. Two virtual models were constructed, calibrated, and validated. The base model representing the actual situation 
and a second one with a double bridge to connect the districts. Simulation results revealed a significant difference in 
the rate of use of the bridge`s lanes in both directions during the peak hours. While the base model showed a use rate 
close 76% and 73% in each direction of the bridge, the double bridge model showed a use rate close to 38% in both 
directions. In conclusion, simulation results suggests that the proposed simplified methodology might be to be a useful 
tool for developing reliable models that produce consistent results.

1. Introduction 
The concentration of the population in large cities and the growing number of vehicles in the streets inevitably give 
rise to traffic congestion in the zones of highest demand. Urban traffic planning is a complex and demanding task. 
Before a mayor infrastructure project is initiated, an extensive analysis of the current situation and the impact of any 
modifications on the dynamics of the city's traffic flow must be completed. 
Classical travel forecasting models have been used by scholars and transport engineers during decades. These models 
are extremely complex and demand the collection of large amounts of data to characterize all the travels that take 
place in an area of study, usually a city or a metropolitan area. It is necessary to know the number of trips being made, 
their origin and destination, the reason and the means of transport used. Additionally, it is necessary to have 
information about the available infrastructure: direction of streets, number of lanes, and traffic control signals. The 
availability of any public transport network and city bus lines must also be incorporated along with travel made using 
private vehicles. In summary, to analyze the effect of any alteration to the existing infrastructure, for instance, a change 
of direction in an avenue or the addition of a new lane, it is necessary to have a complete model to forecast properly 
the future number of trips in the city.  
This research is focused on the development of rapid macroscopic simulation models to evaluate modifications in the 
existing road infrastructure by means of applying a simplified methodology that considers models with a limited 
geographic scope to evaluate specific areas of interest.  
 
1.1 Objective 
Analyze the properness of a simplified methodology for the rapid development of macroscopic simulation models to 
study urban traffic flows by means of the construction and comparison of virtual models of areas with high traffic 
congestion.

6. Conclusion 
Base model simulation results suggest that by means applying the proposed simplified methodology there is 
consistency between the volume flow generated by the model and the flow observed in-situ. Although necessary and 
helpful, updating the OD matrices may not be completely accurate as it does not consider the infrastructure projects 
that were built after the creation of the original OD matrices. 
Even though it is based on the classical models, the main advantage of the proposed simplified methodology is the 
reduced effort (data, measurements, construction, calibration, validation) needed to construct virtual models thanks to 
the focus on rather reduces areas instead of the whole road network. 
Finally, the comparison between the simulation results of the base model and the double bridge model are consistent 
with the expected result, which is a reduction close to 50% in the traffic flow. The results suggest that the proposed 
simplified methodology might be a useful tool to analyze the impact of alterations to the existing by means of 
developing rapid simulation models focused on small areas of interest.

Abstract  
 
In Thai public hospitals, a hospital meal demand did not come from an inward admitted patient's desire but medically 
indicated by a medical professional. Moreover, it will be known only after a daily bedside diagnosis of each patient. 
A hospital self-operated kitchen system in Thai hospitals uses static production planning by predetermined production 
quantity in advance of actual production for a week. Unlike in the new Danish public hospitals, patients can select 
their meals listed on a menu based on their health condition. Danish hospitals' centralized kitchen acted as a production 
hub providing postponed food to its network hospital within its area. Therefore, this paper explores how public 
hospitals in these two different countries manage and control their catering production systems. Two public hospitals 
in Thailand and one public hospital in Denmark are select as a case study. With the exploratory research approach, a 
result not only explored a detail of its supply chain and operations, including inbound operations, production, and 
outbound operations from the selected case study hospitals in both countries. But it also reflects a different principle 
on planning hospital catering system between these two countries.

1. Introduction  
The hospital catering system plays an important role in hospital supply chain management. Supeekit et al (2015) 
explored that the hospital supply chain consisted of ""the patient"" as an ultimate customer seeking diagnosis and 
treatment. Hence the hospital acts as a producer of two major services in the chain; ""clinical care services"" from 
medical professionals and ""supporting services"" such as medical supply, medicines, and food (especially for the 
inpatient department, also known as IPD, where patients are admitted into a hospital for one or several overnight stays.  
Controlling the operations of the hospital catering system is complex and challenging since it is one of the most diverse 
within the healthcare business (Hartwell et al, 2007). The objective of hospital catering is to provide food that meets 
the nutritional and medical requirements, satisfies the patients, improves morale, and is microbiologically safe 
(Hartwell and Edwards, 2001). A well-managed delivery system along with other logistics activities of meal services 
to hospital wards will help the hospital achieve both its food safety and financial goals (Goeminne et al, 2012). 
Thailand is a developing country located in southeast Asia, with a population of 70 million with a GDP per capita of 
7,223$ in 2018. Thailand introduced the Universal Cover Scheme (UCS) in 2002 as a main social health insurance 
program covering approximately 75% of the total population. Under this program, most services were free of charge 
at public hospitals (Paek et al, 2016). While Denmark is a Scandinavian country with a population of around 5.8 
million and GDP per capita of 61,350$ in 2018. Denmark provides free healthcare to all residents funded by taxes. 
One of the major differences between these two countries is the hospital catering system. In Thai public hospitals, IPD 
patients are not allowed to select their meals likes in a restaurant but automatically are provided meals indicated by a

kitchens. However, should there be a shortage of something, there are transports between the three hospital units that 
make up a cased study hospital three times per day as a fixed schedule. Thus small cooling boxes can be delivered at 
short notice.

Since all patients can order room service from 09.00 – 20.00 every day, the receiving kitchen's policy is to consolidate 
orders every 15 minutes, cook, and be ready for the meal hosts to serve within 45 minutes. In other words, the dishes 
will not be made before they are ordered, and therefore, there will be no significant food waste in the kitchen from 
overproduction. The maximum time from a patient's orders to the time the food is served will be no longer than an 
hour in the case of room service. However, it's only a maximum waiting time of 30 minutes from ordering to serving 
in the hospital restaurants.  
 
When the finished meal has been placed on the tray, the tray will be placed in a room service cart, and meal hosts will 
then bring it to the patient, whether the patient is in his/her room or the commons area of the ward. Besides the á la 
carte offers on the menu card, there are meal carts and/or fridges in all wards. The kitchen will refill the carts and 
fridges every day as arranged with the individual ward. This could be sandwiches, fresh fruit, cakes and other things 
that could be served as small-meals. 
  
6. Discussion and Conclusion  
This paper explores and compares a catering production system between a public hospital in Thailand and Denmark. 
Inbound operations from purchasing raw materials, production systems, and outbound operations from the central 
kitchen to the bedside of a patient were explored.  
 
Firstly, we found that Thailand and Denmark have a different nature in its healthcare system, Thai people have direct 
access to a hospital even with a common flu symptom. This is because, in the Thai healthcare system, not all citizens 
have an individual general practitioner assigned to them as in Denmark, where the first point of contact with the health 
care system – unless it is an emergency – is the citizen's general practitioners. The general practitioner can then decide 
to have the patient admitted to the hospital. Outside of the normal hours of work for the general practitioner, Danish 
citizens need to call the emergency unit ahead of arriving at the hospital. Based on the conversation, a medical 
professional will determine if the person can visit the emergency unit or whether they are advised to wait until the 
next day to see their own general practitioner (Ministry of Health, 2019) Thai hospitals are therefore faced with more 
complicated demands, including for hospital meal, as it is more difficult to predict how many will show up at the 
hospital while in Denmark, the general practitioner – or the medical professional at the emergency hotline - plays a 
significant role in managing an inflow of patients by screening and transferring to a hospital as a planned demand. 
 
Secondly, this paper found a different demand nature for hospital meals between the two countries. In Thailand, 
patients cannot select their meals but are assigned by a doctor and medical professionals. The demand is said to be a 
derived demand, not a direct demand like in Denmark. The orders received in the kitchen are the real demand from 
patients right from the hospital's offers. Hasachoo and Masuchun (2017) found that a derived demand caused difficulty 
in production scheduling called schedule nervousness, which is a situation when an actual demand differs from a 
planned schedule. This causes difficulties for Thai hospitals to minimize the inventory while making sure that all 
patients will have their food served on time. 
 
Thirdly, both countries are facing the same challenges from demand uncertainty, which is different from 
manufacturing industries. The Thai hospital system is coping by predetermining its production in advance of actual 
production for weeks while the Danish hospital consolidates a demand from patients every fifteen-minutes before 
deciding on production quantity using postponed input from a central kitchen. These two strategies are also known as 
static and dynamic uncertainty strategies, which were proposed by Bookbinder and Tan (1988). 
 
Other than a discussion under a production perspective, this research found a different role of doctors in the hospital 
catering systems. In Thailand, it is required that admitted patients' food must be assigned by a doctor together with 
medical professionals. On the other hand, in Denmark, the doctor will only interfere with the patient's choice of the 
menu if the patient has encountered a very special medical requirement not known at the time of admittance when it 
would have been entered into the digital journal. Because of such a requirement in a Thai hospital, this paper found

Abstract  
 
In the present, logistics management becomes an important strategy for reducing costs and improving the efficiency 
of all processes in many industries. The healthcare industry is one of the industries that applied logistics concept to 
improve their processes to meet with the standard and requirement of the organization but the implementing of 
logistics management in healthcare industry still faced with many barriers which make the applying of logistics 
concept difficult in the practical. Therefore, the medical supplies department in Thai public hospital was selected to 
be the case study in this research. The main aims of this research focus on the exploration and investigation of all 
logistics processes and barriers in the medical supplies department of Thai public hospital which comprise inbound 
processes, operations, and outbound processes. The unstructured questionnaire was used to collect the data from the 
experts in the hospital and the workers of the medical supplies department. The results of this research, the logistics 
processes, and the barriers are found. And the finding proposed in this research can help the researchers, top 
management, practitioner, and other related people understand more about the situation of the logistics processes and 
the main barriers which happened in the case study. The result can be the guideline for further research of other 
departments in the hospital and other related industries.

1. Introduction  
 
Logistics management becomes an important concept in every industry in the present which the main proposes of this 
concept aim to reduce the cost of the organization and increase the service level for their customers. Logistics 
management also helps the businesses to have a more competitive advantage than their competitors in the violent and 
unpredictable market in the current situation under Covid-19 pandemics. For healthcare businesses, the principle of 
logistics management and process are the same as other businesses. But there is one thing that needs to add in the 
logistics management process which is “patient safety” because the failures in the logistics management for the 
medical supplies will put the patient at risk.  The management of logistics activities will be different from the 
traditional process of physical flows and services flows. It is focused more on the patients through the care chain. 
(Blandine et al. 2018).  
The hospitals worldwide also tried to use the concept of logistics management to increase the efficiency of their 
activities, increase profits, increase customer service, reduce costs, while continuing to meet the customer 
requirements and expectations (Fouad et al. 2018). Hospital is a place that has a more complex system for managing 
people, medical supplies flow, materials flow, food flow, linen flow, etc. It is not only related to the medical but also 
related to non-medical support as well which can help each other to drive the success of the hospital. The integration 
and coordination of all logistics activities could help every operation in the hospital run smoothly, meet the standard 
and the quality of the organization. Landry and Beaulieu (2004) presented that hospital logistics related to the design, 
planning, implementing, and controlling of all activities in the hospital.

2287","Logistics management barriers of medical supplies department 
Based on the finding of this research, the barriers of logistics management implementation in the medical supplies 
department of ABC hospital are:  
1. Lack of expertise in logistics management in the medical supplies department. 
2. There are long processes of documentation. 
3. Lack of sharing information in the hospital. 
4. The different lead time of delivering products from the vendors. 
5. Excess of inventory at the stock of the users. 
6. Excess of inventory and shortage of inventory in some items in the main warehouse 
7. Limitation of the number of medical supplies department staff. 
8. Inventory level mismatch with data in the system.  
9. Lot sizing of ordering process unstable. 
10. Uncertainty of the demand from users.  
 
5. Conclusion  
 
This research aims to explore and investigate the logistics processes and barriers of the medical supplies department 
of Thai public hospital and the ABC hospital has been selected to be the case study. The results of this research found 
that in the logistics processes of the medical supplies department, there are three main processes include inbound 
processes, operations, and outbound processes. The inbound processes will be started when the vendor received the 
order from the medical supplies department until the hospital receive the products from the vendors which the locations 
and the lead time of delivery from each vendor will be difference. For operations, there are four main processes 
comprise of receiving, storing, picking, and dispatching. It is started when the vendors deliver the products to the 
hospital. The vendors delivered all products to the medical supplies warehouse then the staff of the warehouse 
monitored and received them. The products from the receiving process will be transferred to the storage area and wait 
for the order of the users. After the orders came, the staff picked the products out of their locations and prepared for 
the dispatch process. For the outbound processes which is the last process of the medical supplies department. The 
products were ready to dispatch to the users which are out-patient department (OPD), in-patient department (IPD), 
operating room (OR), emergency room (ER), etc. Even the logistics management can improve the efficiency of the 
medical supplies department of the case study but there are some barriers for logistics management concept 
implementation such as lack of expertise in logistics management in the medical supplies department, lack of sharing 
information in the hospital there are long processes of documentation, the uncertainty of the demand from users, lot 
sizing of ordering process unstable, etc.  
For future research direction, due to there are some barriers that made the implementation of the logistics management 
concept difficult and cannot operate smoothly. Therefore, it should use the multi-criteria decision-making methods 
for prioritizing the barriers to support the decision of the top management such as fuzzy AHP, best- worst methods, 
etc., or finding the solutions for solving these barriers.

Abstract  
 
The main resource of a company is its human talent, since it is thanks to the cooperation and contribution of employees 
and the performance of their roles that it is possible to achieve its objectives. Among the factors that most influence 
job satisfaction is the salary, since an employee who feels that he/she receives a fair payment for the activities he/she 
performs will remain happy with his/her job and with the organization in which he/she works. The personnel of 
Productos Caribe S.A.S. is presenting nonconformities related to remunerations because in 1979, the year when they 
started operations and the salary was established, the management did not take into account the importance of a 
remuneration that contemplated the specification and description of the positions and the dynamics of the sector in 
terms of salary for similar jobs. The objective of this research is to propose an equitable remuneration through a salary 
structure in which it is previously determined whether the salary earned corresponds to the skills and the physical and 
cognitive components required by each position, considering the external competitiveness and the compensation

1. Introduction  
Human talent constitutes a competitive advantage for a company through its contribution to the achievement of goals 
and the proper use of resources. This can be affected if employees work long hours in inadequate work environments, 
perform positions that do not have a clear definition of their functions or receive an inappropriate salary, which can 
cause a decrease in their motivation and impair their productivity.  
 
One of the main reasons for job dissatisfaction is the remuneration assigned because, on occasions, it is not 
proportional to the job description and specification, causing workers to feel that their work is not adequately 
recognized and opt to look for new jobs in other companies, increase their absenteeism, among others. In order to 
avoid this problem, it is pertinent that every organization implements a compensation system that allows establishing 
the importance of the position taking into account their requirements and responsibilities to promote the development 
of a salary structure that defines the remuneration in a fair manner. 
 
In addition, the salaries offered in the sector must be appreciated, because if the remuneration is lower for jobs with 
similar conditions and functions, it will not be possible to attract and retain qualified personnel and competitiveness 
in this area will be lower than that of the competition.   
 
The following study is carried out with the intention of proposing a salary structure to the company Productos Caribe 
S.A.S. through the implementation of a compensation technique and the elaboration of a salary curve considering the 
remuneration dynamics of the market to establish a remuneration congruent to the functions of each position that 
contributes to improve the perception of the employee with respect to the organization and his job.

It is appropriate to make the salary adjustment to the 8 positions that require it because this will allow to promote 
equitable remuneration conditions (table 16). Although, for Productos Caribe S.A.S. it may result in an increase in the 
value of its payroll, in the long term it will show an appreciable improvement in the motivation of employees.

6. Conclusion  
The purpose of the study was to propose a compensation for the positions that make up Productos Caribe S.A.S. in 
order to mitigate the demotivation of its employees. It was necessary to implement the compensation system of points 
assignment with the purpose of knowing the relevance of the job positions and their relationship with the salary earned 
in the absence of any previous one.  Among the analyzed, it is observed that the description and specification for the 
production manager, quality control manager and human resources administrator is not proportional to what they 
actually receive, so their relative values are considerable but are not reflected in a fair and equitable remuneration.  
 With the relative value of each job position, the salary curve was designed to delimit the function that best reflects 
the behavior of the data obtained by means of a trend line. Those with a score above 770 require an increase of 50% 
or more. The areas requiring the greatest salary leveling with an increase of at least 35% are production and quality 
control.  
With respect to the comparison with the sector to establish how competitive the organization is in terms of salaries, it 
was found that of the 10 jobs valued, only 5 are in the salary ranges, implying that if Productos Caribe S.A.S. does 
not consider the situation, it will be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and maintain an organizational 
climate that encourages its workers to perform their duties with the best possible attitude.

Abstract 
 
The following research work proposes the creation and implementation of a strategic planning for the company Metal Proffice 
S.A.S. For which a methodology was used that allowed to collect integral information of the company, with the help of tools 
it was possible to obtain an internal and external diagnosis of the company and thus be able to identify the shortcomings where 
it should be reinforced. In addition, it was possible to propose the objectives and strategic plans that would commit all the 
company's stakeholders to consolidate those activities that would provide a better competitive position and a significant 
improvement in the production areas. Finally, certain recommendations are given for the owners of the company so that they 
can have a long-term vision of the benefits of the project.

1. Introduction 
 
Strategic planning has served for many years as a valid guide for the fulfillment of organizational objectives; however, the strategic 
planning process accepted by most CEOs found less acceptance among middle managers and other employees, who only saw it as ""yet 
another form- filling exercise,"" according to Ansoff and McDonell” (Aguilera Castro, 2010). The following research work aimed to create 
a strategic plan focused on the company Metal Proffice S.A.S. to lead the company towards success, fulfilling in a planned and organized 
manner the strategic objectives proposed by the plan. At present, the importance of a strategic direction in any type of company is 
recognized so that they can proceed correctly in situations that arise in their normal activity and be aware of their direction in the future. 
It is possible to structure in this research work strategies that allow Metal Proffice S.A.S to take the initiative to improve its internal 
process and consequently, to enhance the solidity of the company to deliver solutions to its clients. 
 
In the first measure, a diagnosis was made to the entire organization, analyzing each part of it to discover the characteristics of its 
administrative and operational processes. For this, tools that allowed external analysis such as PESTEL were used, in addition to 
methodologies such as Five Forces of Michael Porter to further evaluate the competition, stakeholders and other factors that influence 
the company. A survey was also conducted with the management to obtain more knowledge of the company from the experience gathered 
by the owners and operators throughout these years. The SWOT matrix was implemented to determine those strategies that could be very 
useful for the internal part of the company. Finally, a strategic map was designed to outline the corporate objectives, which opened the 
way to the development of the action plans that the organization needed. Carrying out the diagnosis of the company allowed to evaluate 
a structure of the situation in which the organization was located and thus facilitated the design and creation of the strategic planning that 
Metal Proffice S.A.S. needed.  
 
Regarding the structure of the present investigative work, first a description of the problem of the case study will be found, where those 
relevant characteristics for the investigation of the market where the company operates are defined, such as the problems, events, and 
facts. Then an analysis of the commercialization of the organization was carried out, showing the activities in which, it is involved. 
Subsequently, the external and internal analyzes are specified to finally deliver the step by step to carry out the strategic plan. Finally, 
the action plans are analyzed and the respective conclusions of the implementation of the strategic direction in the company are delivered.

2306","5.3 Proposed Improvements 
 
The political situation of the company evaluated based on the PESTEL methodology brings with it possibilities to 
expand the brand thanks to the support that SMEs in the city receive from the government in recent years. The 
foregoing is predictable by the state, which has determined that, with investments in small and medium-sized 
companies, they will help the Colombian economy increase and therefore a decrease in inflation. MetalProffice can 
take advantage of the economic situation in which Colombia will find itself (especially the region in which it is 
located) where, increasingly, the high demand for furniture is fundamental for the large number of public and private 
entities that are creating and legally constituting in the city, which need all kinds of products from chairs, tables, 
among other types of furniture for offices and / or schools. In addition, the good management of its production 
systems will quickly position it as one of the best due to the increase in labor productivity and fulfillment of orders 
that bring with it an increase in sales, thus fulfilling one of the objectives set by the owners. 
 
According to the PORTER analysis carried out, certain external points are also rescued, but focused on the rivalry 
of competitors and on the qualities that the company must maintain to have a good relationship with customers and 
suppliers. In the context of the market, companies compete to have the best customers and strive to fully retain them 
with the company. After all, they are the ones who collaborate with the business growth that the company seeks. 
MetalProffice must generate very strong social relationships with its stakeholders and must respond quickly to their 
needs to keep competition below.On the part of potential entrants to the furniture manufacturing business, although 
there are not many, one must be cautious of the emergence of any company with new ideas for customers since they 
could sound very attractive and consequently sales would decrease. 
 
This analysis to assess the external situation helps to complement the objectives that would be about to be created for 
the strategic direction. Now, a last analysis carried out at work was decisive for the placement of company goals. This 
is called SWOT analysis and it is a tool that allowed us to know the company internally, evaluating its strengths, 
opportunities, weaknesses, and threats. It should be mentioned that not everything was investigative and thanks to the 
information provided by the owners it was much easier to draw conclusions about the internal situation of the 
company.Based on the strategies that were deduced from the classification of the aspects, the company in relation to 
its strengths and opportunities needs to improve the space of the facilities to maintain order in the production area, 
as well as to introduce new machines and generate innovative ideas to attack potential threats from the competition. 
Encouraging both administrative and operational personnel for the continuous improvement of the company is vital 
to build a development environment aimed at meeting the objectives. So, the creation of action plans to achieve 
certain goals becomes an opportunity for management for the company to enter the market considering its current 
situation. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In this project, it was sought to implement a strategic direction to the company MetalProffice S.A.S that leads it to 
success without omitting the objectives proposed by it in different administrative or operational areas. Additionally, 
the creation of this project contributes significantly to the growth of the company as it provides a fundamental pillar 
that every company needs to efficiently develop and fulfill production tasks. It is recognized that the market in which 
the company operates is very competitive and that is why many companies tend to seek innovative alternatives to 
stand out from the rest. Sometimes it is not enough to offer the best product but also to know the company's way of 
working to improve internally to optimally face external factors, realizing the processes and integral solutions that 
there are to offer to customers. The work addressed the situation that the company manifests to understand both 
internal and external strengths and deficiencies. Its analysis was carried out through strategic evaluation 
methodologies such as SWOT, Pestel, Five Forces of Michael Porter and through surveys carried out with the owners 
of the company. Finally, an analysis was carried out on the scenario and the current influence of the company in the 
market and then applying a strategic direction based on the main needs. The market study and analysis of the Five 
Forces of Michael Porter, allowed to identify and corroborate that the Colombian market is saturated with 
competitors that carry out the same activity, however, in the city of Cartagena the advantage of having only two 
companies was found legally constituted including the one in this research study, that is, despite the large number

2316","of national competitors, MetalProffice has the possibility of growing as it captures most local clients. In addition, 
among other findings identified during the development of the work, we can mention the importance of loyalty 
throughout the company's supply chain, this to meet all the objectives that management must increase its profits and 
in turn satisfy the essential needs of customers. Therefore, the company must apply quick solutions where it 
maintains good relationships with customers and suppliers, just as it needs an injection of capital from the owners to 
improve the production area. It is worth mentioning that the ecological part was a very important point found in all 
the research, thanks to the Pestel analysis the opportunity to recycle the surplus of the raw material was evidenced 
and obtain monetary benefits from this action. It should be noted that the Colombian state grants companies tax 
benefits for the simple fact of causing a neutral (not positive) impact on the environment through the intervention of 
the recycling process, which avoids subsequent and increasing contamination in the area. Among other opportunities, 
it was found that the implementation of an area of innovation and development in the company and that targets within 
this business sector, will help to obtain new products and services that are unique in the market, becoming attractive 
to any client. In addition to the above, the hiring of people with disabilities, beyond being part of the benefits that 
companies can obtain, provide employment to a sector of the Colombian population that can hardly obtain decent 
job stability. 
 
As proposals for the company to improve significantly and maintain a reliable status in the market, management can 
seek strategies for minimizing costs and exponential growth in sales, through good production and design of its 
products as well as management of a good marketing campaign, providing the company with excellent profits. Also, 
by implementing all the management systems or, failing that, those that mostly cover the organization, it would help 
to provide highly certified and safe products and services. However, it is vitally important that the company in such 
case does not have the experience in implementing a management system, it must turn to an expert consultant on the 
subject so that it can develop the necessary processes and help the company to be certified quickly and without 
wasting money. Everything previously described is the conclusion that was determined for MetalProffice to be able 
to take advantage of all those alternatives that seek to improve quality management within the company, the inclusion 
of new products in the market and the optimization of the service to retain customers. Since, in a certain way, they 
are the main strategies that you must implement to position yourself among the best companies in Cartagena.

Abstract: 
 
Understanding the fragility induced by multiple interdependencies is one of the major challenges in the design of 
resilient infrastructures. These rippled failures greatly increase their vulnerability to disruptions along with delays in 
their restoration efforts. Networks feature a bidirectional dependence such that power stations depend on 
communication nodes for control, and communication nodes depend on power stations for their electricity supply. 
This research investigates the effects of disruptions on the interdependent infrastructures of electric power and 
telecommunications networks and performs an empirically based analysis to understand their interdependence and its 
effects in restoration efforts. The aftermath of extreme events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemic outbreaks 
provide a unique opportunity to obtain experimental evidence that the critical infrastructures are indeed 
interdependent.  Empirical analysis including Granger causality tests are performed to assess interdependency between 
the networks following the event. After interdependency and its duration are properly assessed, a system dynamics 
model is proposed to provide insights on how to reduce restoration times by appropriate selection of model parameters.

Abstract 
 
This research analyzes the reorganization of the traffic control devices in the city’s busiest avenue by means of 
implementing microscopic simulation models. The investigation focused on the development of alternatives to help 
reduce traffic congestion problems during hours of high demand. Initially, a base model to represent the actual 
situation in Valdivia’s downtown is constructed and validated. Then a second model including the proposed 
reorganization of the existing infrastructure is developed. Both models are implemented in PTV Vissim. Simulation 
results revealed that the proposed modifications help the aggregate time travel by 32,9% and the aggregate delay times 
for vehicles by 49,5%. In conclusion, the results suggest that virtual models properly calibrated and validated can be 
used to evaluate and quantify the potential impact of a reorganization of the traffic control devices.

1. Introduction 
The concentration of population in urban centers and the consequent increase in the number of vehicles reveal the 
precariousness of urban planning. Funding constraints often result in the city's infrastructure growing at a slower rate 
than the population's needs. This results in traffic congestion problems that deteriorate people’s quality of life in large 
cities. To overcome this situation, many cities have rules that restrict the circulation of vehicles, access to certain 
districts, the use of lanes reserved for public transport, among others. 
One of the greatest difficulties in vehicle traffic planning is to quantify the impact, positive or negative, of a specific 
project on the dynamics of vehicle flow. Fortunately, technology allows the development of highly complex 
simulation models that allow the current vehicular flow to be studied in detail and forecasting the impact of 
modifications to the existing infrastructure. The present work focuses on the development of virtual simulation models 
to analyze alternatives for the reordering of traffic control elements in the downtown of Valdivia, Chile. 
 
1.1. Objective 
Analyze and compare improvement alternatives to reorganize the existing traffic control elements in areas with high 
traffic flow through implementing microscopic traffic simulation models. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1. Transportation systems 
Transportation systems can be conceptualized as the interaction between a demand and supply of travels. Travelers 
commute for work, study, and other reasons. Travel supply corresponds to the means of transport available at different 
times, the road network through which they circulate, the infrastructure and traffic control devices (Ortúzar & 
Willumsen, 2008). 
 
2.2. Microscopic simulation 
Simulation can be defined as the process of creating virtual models to represent the behavior of a real system and its 
subsequent study under different conditions. In the context of urban traffic simulation, there are two main types of 
simulation: microscopic and macroscopic, which differ mainly in the approach applied (Figure 1). Macroscopic

6. Conclusion 
The proposed model containing the installation of an additional bus stop for public transport in the study area, located 
between the existing ones; the reorganization of the use of bus stops for the stopping of different minibuses lines, and 
the restriction of the use of some stops by line taxis; and the definition of optimal schedules of green light times and 
synchronization between traffic control lights – help reduce the traffic congestion, delays, and travel times. 
Specifically, the improvements proposed would result in reductions of 32.9% in total aggregate travel times and of 
49.5% in total aggregate delay times, by vehicles that drive through the study area during the time period that was 
modelled (5pm to 8pm in workdays, under conditions comparable to those studied and simulated).This research is, 
thus, one example of the usability and capabilities of microscopic traffic simulation for the analysis of transportation 
problems, particularly for the modeling and analysis of complex interactions between vehicles of different types and 
behaviors, and the definition and proposal of alternatives for the improvement of transportation systems. These 
simulation tools have several more capabilities and uses, which may strengthen the analytical and data-driven 
definition and backing of public policy initiatives and projects in transportation and road infrastructure.

Abstract 
 
This work analyzes the impact of incorporating waterbus routes into the existing public transport network by means 
of implementing macroscopic simulation models. The research is carries out following a classic 4-stages structure: 
analysis, design, construction, and validation. During the construction, the classical 4-step travel forecast model was 
applied. Initially a base model to represent the actual public transport network of Valdivia (Chile) is constructed. 
Updated origin-destination matrices along with new measurements taken in-situ were used to calibrate and validate 
the virtual model. Then a second model that includes the proposed waterbus routes is constructed. Both models were 
implemented in PTV Visum. Simulation results revealed that only a fraction that barely reached a 1.8% of all trips 
was made through the proposed water bus routes. In conclusion, with an estimated error of 9.3%, the work suggest 
that the proposed waterbus routes might be a complement to the existing transport network, but they would not be the 
traveler’s favorite option.

1. Introduction 
It has been observed that during the last decades the population in large cities has incremented significantly. People 
move in the search for new opportunities and better living conditions. It is not common that the growing in the 
population comes along with more infrastructure to satisfy the new housing and transportation needs. Also, recent 
favorable economic cycles have made possible that many families acquire one or more vehicles, which sooner or later 
will end up giving rise to traffic congestion problems. Usually, centralized governmental urban traffic planning offices 
are responsible for designing alternatives to make traffic flow on a road network more efficient. Along with the private 
transport means, the public transport system plays an important role in the dynamics of cities. Although in many cases 
public transport lines do not obey centralized planning since it might be under the control of private corporations, it 
usually covers great areas connecting distant districts and transporting thousands of people every day. A special case 
are those cities crossed by rivers and whose connectivity depends greatly on the existence of bridges, which are 
commonly the center of serious traffic congestion problems. This research is focused on the possible implementation 
of waterbus lines to complement the public transport network of Valdivia, Chile.  
 
1.1 Objective 
Analyze the impact of incorporating waterbus routes as a complement to public transport network of Valdivia by 
means of implementing macroscopic simulation models. 
 
2. Literature Review  
 
2.1 Simulation 
The simulation process involves the creation of virtual models to imitate the behavior real systems and their subsequent 
study under specific conditions. Urban traffic simulation models require several specific objects such as zones, 
centroids, nodes, arcs, connectors, routes, bus lines and stops for the public transport network.

6. Conclusion 
The simulation results obtained during both calibration and validation of the base model suggest that the model was 
constructed correctly and that the base model represents the actual system and therefore it can be used to explore 
alterations to the existing transport network.  
The simulation results produced by the waterbus route model showed that a fraction of all trips was made through the 
proposed water bus routes. However, the percentage barely reached a 1.8%. 
Finally, the selection of key indicators to compare both virtual models revealed that the incorporation of waterbus 
routes modifies in some extent the distribution of trips in the city.

Abstract  
 
It has been well established that sustainable development is a critical issue worldwide. Countries should consider the 
conservative consumption of available resources while maintaining their desired levels of economic growth. This 
study aimed to develop a global sustainability index for the Group of Eight + Five (G8+5) countries by using the 
Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The index is based on three criteria: the

competitive advantage over other multiple-criteria decision-making techniques. They also reveal the criteria weight 
sensitivity of the developed index. This suggests that policymakers and researchers should pay special attention to

1. Introduction  
 
It has been well established that sustainable development (SD) is a critical issue worldwide.  SD initiatives aim to 
meet the needs of current and future generations (Schaefer and Crane, 2005). This creates a dilemma for countries as 
they promote conservative approaches to resource consumption while maintaining their desired levels of economic 
growth. Therefore, in the past two decades, developed countries and many developing countries have sponsored SD 
initiatives (Bilgili et al. 2017, Borland et al. 2019, González et al. 2017, Majid 2020, Zhang and Wen 2008). Given 
that the Group of Eight + Five (G8+5) countries are either the most developed countries (Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) or the largest emerging economies 
(Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa), their initiatives are supposed to represent the ideal sustainable 
practices that can be benchmarked. Thus, this paper  argues that the economic, social, and environmental data from 
these 13 countries could encourage researchers and policymakers worldwide to investigate and to benchmark SD 
initiatives. 
 
1.1 Objective 
 
This study aimed to develop a global sustainability index for G8+5 countries by using the Technique for Order of 
Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The developed index is based on three criteria: the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP), carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and the World Happiness Index (WHI), which constitute 
the economic, environmental, and social dimensions, respectively, of sustainability. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
Mensah and Casadevall (2019) noted that although sustainability refers to the capacity to maintain “things” over time

2340","countries either maintained their positions or rose just one level. The exception was Japan, which dropped just one 
level. It should be noted that in Model 4, all the countries except China scored higher than 50%.

6. Conclusion  
 
This paper presents the TOPSIS as a flexible MCDM tool to develop a sustainability index. Although the developed 
index was formulated on the basis of only three criteria and 13 alternatives, an unlimited number of criteria and 
alternatives (countries in this study) can be managed through the TOPSIS. This flexibility gives the TOPSIS a 
competitive advantage over other MCDM techniques, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), goal programing, 
interpretive structural modeling (ISM), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). Other 
MCDM techniques, such as the VIKOR method and the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of 
Evaluations (PROMETHEE), share the same competitive advantages as the TOPSIS because the criteria and 
alternatives in these techniques are treated almost similarly during model construction. Such an attribute offers the 
potential for developing an extended global sustainability index that includes all United Nations (UN) countries. 
However, the results of the present study indicate that the developed index is very sensitive to criteria weighting. 
Specifically, the results revealed an extreme difference in the rankings for the United States and China in two of the 
models: the GDP and CO2 perspectives. This suggests that policymakers and researchers should pay special attention 
to criteria selection and weighting.

Abstract 
 
Downtime due to sudden machine failure will cause much loss to the company. To overcome this, 
companies need to develop suitable maintenance strategy. Nowadays, machines in smart manufacturing 
provide large volume data to monitor machine conditions. Big data analytics becomes needed for processing 
large data, especially for predicting machine failure in Industry 4.0. Predictive maintenance works better 
than corrective or preventive maintenance. It can continuously monitor diagnostic and prognostic processes 
to predict future failures and the equipment's remaining useful life (RUL). Using real multi-sensor data and 
machine failure reports in industrial equipment, machine learning models can study data patterns and build 
failure prediction models based on real-time condition monitoring. The purpose of this study is to construct 
a diagnostic and prognostic model with tuning optimal machine learning parameters in support vector 
machine and random forest (RF) for classification of equipment conditions and RUL so that company can 
find out the prediction of future failure times. Also, the comparison of machine learning parameters and 
methods is carried out to determine which model has the highest accuracy. Based on each model's accuracy, 
RF performed better than SVM in diagnostic and prognostic models.

1. Introduction 
Smart manufacturing is physical and digital integration in manufacturing from upstream to downstream by utilizing 
advanced information to increase flexibility and adaptability to change with the Internet of Things (IoT) (Moyne and 
Iskandar, 2017). The data generated by the supporting machines for smart manufacturing has a large volume. Large-
scale data processing (big data analytics) is necessary for data processing to support company decision making. Data 
can come from variations in production machines and equipment as well as factory locations. One of the data used in 
supporting industry 4.0 is sensor data to monitor the machine's reliability. Sensor data can be used to make 
maintenance planning decisions to avoid unnecessary equipment replacement, reduce unplanned machine downtime, 
energy efficiency, and save cost that usually occurs in the company. 
Based on a case study on one manufacturing company in Indonesia that already uses smart manufacturing industrial 
equipment, machine availability only reaches 70 – 80 %. This number can lead to several low productivities in 
production. With provided large volume of sensor-data, the company will have the opportunity to optimize 
maintenance strategy and reduce unplanned machine downtime to increase availability time and production 
productivity. 
There are three types of machine maintenance strategies: corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance, and 
predictive maintenance (Carvalho et al, 2019). Corrective and preventive maintenance exclude diagnostic and 
prognostic activities in determining maintenance. In predictive maintenance, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is 
carried out. CBM discusses the maintenance plan's optimization by relying on sensor data generated by the engine in 
real-time and preventing system failures by knowing when and how the machine will be maintained. Developing a 
maintenance strategy using CBM method will need a good quality of data representing the existing machines' situation 
and state. 
CBM data processing with machine learning can continuously analyze patter data from the latest data by itself. 
Machine learning in predictive maintenance can be used to diagnose and prognostic the machine's deterioration against 
existing parameters. However, not many studies have carried out both processes using real industrial data. Several

6. Conclusion 
This research proposed a fault diagnostic algorithm based on two algorithms for multi-class classification of normal 
and abnormal conditions and fault prognostic for RUL classes in predictive maintenance of Motor EPFAN with sensor 
data. Different machine learning techniques, namely SVM and RF have been used to proposed model scenarios. 
According to the discussion and result analysis, the proposed diagnostic and prognostic model could predict classes 
of each model. Each algorithm has good accuracy for the diagnostic and prognostic model. But the highest accuracy, 
precision, and recall were obtained with random forest. Therefore, RF is a suitable algorithm for Motor EPFAN fault 
diagnosis and prognostic. Using this proposed model, similar industries can optimize sensor data utilization to make 
better decision-making for maintenance strategies and predict remaining RUL. Other machine learning techniques and 
parameter will be explored more to improve the performance of research results in the future.

Abstract 
In line with the advancement of Industry 4.0 which provides opportunities for the utilization of sensors and Machine 
Learning (ML) technology, make Predictive Maintenance (PdM) practices much easier. Regarding implementing PdM 
with ML, manufacturers need to provide data that supports the machine learning process. However, the majority of 
data is unlabeled and still requires manual labeling to support the learning process, which is risky, costly, and labor-
intensive. Therefore, the current research uses the integration of Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Learning 
(SSL) to solve labeling problems and support PdM models with a better level of generalization. First, unlabeled multi-
sensor data stored on the main server database and slight labeled data becomes the research sample. Second, the AL 
scheme selects the most valuable unlabelled samples, to label and add to the training data set. Third, the SSL scheme 
to optimize the data usage, using the remaining samples to be labeled. Finally, based on the augmented training data 
set, the fault diagnostic model is trained to support the failure class prediction. Regarding the selection of the ML 
algorithm, the result of trained Random Forest Classification (RFC) could predict a fault diagnostic model of 
approximately 99,85%.

1. Introduction
The availability of production machines and equipment is one thing that needs to be considered to support the 
continuity of manufacturing process. According to Ran et al., (2019) the shutdown and unplanned downtime will 
disrupt the company's core processes and have the potential to cause losses and loss of reputation which is difficult to 
quantify. According to this, equipment maintenance practices are one of the policies that need to be prioritized in 
manufacturing. CKM Lee et al., (2017) and Susto et al., (2013) explain that machine maintenance strategies can be 
categorized into three types, that is Corrective Maintenance (CM), Preventive Maintenance (PM), and Predictive 
Maintenance (PdM). The technology revolutions and development of system complexity lead to the transition of 
machine maintenance management from CM to PM to PdM. In this case, PdM becomes a trade-off between the two 
strategies by optimizing the frequency of maintenance efforts and maintenance costs. Montero Jimenez et al., (2020) 
and Ran et al., (2019) state that PdM allows the lowest possible maintenance frequency to prevent unplanned CM 
without incurring excessive costs for doing too much PM. 
Chuang et al., (2019), Lande et al., (2019), and Sakib & Wuest, (2018) define PdM as a maintenance activity carried 
out by detecting the changes on physical condition of machines, that aimed for maintenance activities and maximizing 
tool life without increases failure risk, which seeks to understand that maintenance must be taken to delay the failure. 
In contrast to other strategic approaches, Jimenez-Cortadi et al., (2020) explained that CM more focused on machine

achievement of the classifier model that was successfully formed were able to validate the effectiveness of using AL 
and SSL integration, with higher results when compared to previous studies. Based on the research results, the 
integration of the two learning methods can improve the quality of training data more optimally, and produce a fault 
diagnostic accuracy that is above 95%. Thus, the use of AL and SSL in failure diagnostics is able to solve labeling 
problems more effectively so as to optimize the use of data and support the development of prediction models with a 
good degree of generalization. In this case, this method plays a role in overcoming labeling problems, which can 
improving the quality of training data by the addition of data labeled to supprt machine learning process.  
 
5. Conclusion  
In this paper, we develop the concept of active semi-supervised learning (AL and SSL) to support PdM activities, 
especially for the formation of a fault diagnostic model that is able to recognize machine equipment failure modes. 
The main contribution of this research is to provide the development of research theories and methods through the 
integration of AL and SSL. AL learning makes expertise only performs labeling on the most informative samples, 
which can save on the labeling process and can improve the quality of better training data. Furthermore, from the 
unlabeled data that is still available, to optimize the extraction of information on the data, SSL learning is carried out, 
in which the labeling mechanism is carried out automatically by machine annotators without the involvement of 
expertise anymore. In addition, this study contributes to forming a failure diagnostic model more effectively and 
efficiently, as well as achieving a more accurate classification performance using only a small amount of labeled data. 
Thus, the integration of the AL and SSL approaches has advantages when compared to other ML strategies. In this 
case, with the implementation of the existing case studies, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method 
are proven, and the results show that this method can improve the accuracy of the fault diagnostic model by using a 
small number of labeled samples.

Abstract 
It will be seen in this research article: 
Process management.- In order to properly manage the academic administrative processes related to the services 
provided to the student, the processes were ordered using the international standard ISO 9001: 2015, as well as the 
administration of knowledge to achieve the expected results. 
Measure quality. - The indicators of the processes on the dashboard are not enough, therefore it was compared with 
the opinion of the students; to perform this measurement, a questionnaire validated by expert judgment was prepared 
based on the ServQual model. 
Fuzzy logic.-  
Quality in its various dimensions and sub-dimensions, being subjective, was clarified using fuzzy algorithms based 
on a membership function, in order to have a certain level of certainty in relation to students' perceptions. 
Results: After applying the fuzzy logic to the survey carried out with the students, it was visualized in a perceptions 
dashboard and the non-conformities were analyzed, which constitute the new baseline to improve.

1. Introduction 
According to Vergara and Quesada (2011) point out that the quality of the service of an educational establishment is 
reflected in the conformity and satisfaction experienced by the academic community about the different services 
provided by it. 
When the processes of an organization are disorganized, the improvisation and the chaos originates, therefore there 
will be users or dissatisfied customers. One of the ways to manage quality is to use the ISO 9001: 2015 technical 
standard, which in its various items promotes the quality of services and products, facing the scenarios under a risk 
strategy and with a culture based on leadership of senior management. 
Quality in higher education is estimated by quality assurance systems using self-assessment processes. Higher 
Education Institutions (HEIs) conceive it as a stakeholders' active participation process of identifying strengths and

The hypothesis is validated given that by implementing orderly processes, the quality of administrative processes is 
being improved as seen in Table 1, which is the students' perspective, however there is much to improve which will 
be seen according to the model until reaching an ideal state of quality of service in a comprehensive manner. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The model to manage quality and validate it, leads to the following conclusions: 
The implementation of administrative academic processes using the ISO 9001:2015 standard improved student 
satisfaction levels, as seen in the results of Table 1. As the perception of quality is subjective, it was necessary to 
clarify through fuzzy logic implemented by means of a fuzzy logic algorithm. 
Education, being constantly evolving, influences processes, therefore student satisfaction, so each academic semester  
has to iterate the improvement in the quality of the educational product and its services. 
Improving administrative academic processes is not enough, it is necessary to go further, it is very important, the 
personal attention service, the level of empathy, the infrastructure, the feeling of security, the reliability, that the 
student perceives, for that reason it was used the ServQual model, to measure these perceptions which is also seen in 
the Table 1 , Figure 6 and Figure 7, these indicators must be crossed with the accreditation indicators, it was also 
observed that to implement processes according to the ISO 9001 standard : 2015, to provide a quality service, 
knowledge must be constantly managed, that is, information must be administered to all personnel involved in the 
processes and services, with talks and induction workshops. 
As a suggestion or recommendation, the perceptions survey should be conducted by an autonomous entity of the 
accreditation area or an external entity that does not belong to the Faculty, and not by the directors of the professional 
careers, since there is a conflict of interest. Then the perceptions report should be delivered to the dean and the directors 
of the professional careers to make the respective improvements, currently it is handled internally.

Abstract 
The online retailing industry activity has been steadily increasing in the past couple of years, due to the wide product 
offerings and provides customer convenience. The Philippines is part of the Asian population with steadily increasing 
online retailing activity, making the country one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in Asia. With the 
increased number of online retailers, different factors can now be determined, as well as an implementation framework 
for brick-and-mortar retailers' consideration to expand into online retailing. A survey was conducted to measure the 
perception of Philippine-based brick-and-mortar retailers with regard to key factors to expand into online retailing. 
The research study used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework and Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) in determining the significant factors that retailers consider in their expansion into online retailing. 
Cybersecurity, IT Infrastructure, Capital Cost, Reach, and Online Retailing Industry Attractiveness were all found to 
have a significant effect on Retailer's Decision to Expand into Online Retailing. A readiness index was formulated 
from the results of the SEM, which in turn aided in developing an implementation framework catered to different 
levels of readiness.

1. Introduction  
Brick-and-mortar retailing usually requires businesses to sell an array of products, and have customers personally go 
inside the store with the intention of purchasing an item (Rhodes, 2014). According to Ganesha, et.al. (2020), the 
brick-and-mortar experience would need a huge amount of physical effort, as well as, more time in fulfilling shopping 
tasks. These retailers in downstream supply chain were once regarded as the most powerful members in distributing 
finished goods to customers (Adivar, et. al., 2019) until the so-called “retail apocalypse” gained traction in many 
countries including USA, resulting in the start of physical stores dwindling in size and numbers, ushering in a steady 
growth of the online retailing industry (Helm, Kim, & Riper, 2020). The retail apocalypse, as suggested by Morgan 
(2018) was just a result of the rapidly evolving retailing landscape brought about by technology, and those who cannot 
adapt soon obsolesce. 
Online retailing has seen a recent rise in activity because it is able to provide a large array of products to the customers, 
all in relative convenience (Saroj, 2018). Also, a study in Japan shows that both retailers and customers incur lower 
costs through online retailing (Miyatake, Nemoto, Nakaharai, & Hayashi, 2015). Brick-and-mortar stores experience 
limitations in scalability due to the cost of putting up and maintaining a physical store (Enders, & Jelassi, 2000), while 
Miyatake et al. (2015) found customers may also be subject to lower costs since they will not be traveling to and from 
the physical store to purchase the product. 
To enhance value proposition and/or the reduction of costs, brick-and-mortar retailers are now studying the appropriate 
strategies to integrate online channels into their existing operations (Gallino & Moreno, 2014). The online payment

The primary purpose of this research was to determine the factors that Filipino retailers primarily consider for them 
to expand into online retailing, as well as to help other retailers in their decision when it comes to the expansion. A 
survey consisting of 55 questions was conducted on 506 retailers, consisting of statements that would verify factors 
considered by retailers prior to expanding into online retailing. 
The first objective of the study was to determine the factors that Filipino retailers consider in their decision to expand 
into online retailing. SEM was utilized to determine the relationship between latent variables, from which the 
significant factors were determined. Initially, the research was guided by and ventured on the suitability of the 
Technological Acceptance Model, but it was later found through the SEM results that the said model does not have a 
significant effect on the decision of retailers to expand online. The second objective of the study was to recommend 
an implementation framework for online retailing. With the results of the SEM, a readiness index score sheet with the 
corresponding weights together with a readiness index were formulated in order to verify retailers’ readiness in 
expanding into online retail. The index was utilized in coming up with an implementation framework which would 
serve as a guide for Filipino retailers to strategically implement online retailing based on their level of readiness.  
5. Recommendation 
The study acknowledges that as difficulties in gathering data amid the COVID-19 pandemic present themselves, the 
study was only able to gather substantial responses from micro and small enterprises, with only a miniscule amount 
of medium enterprises being able to answer the survey. Further studies are recommended where data gathering is 
much more accessible to gather a substantial number of responses from medium enterprises.

Abstract 
 
Entrepreneurship plays a significant role in higher education institutions, allowing students to achieve their personal 
goals. The design and implementation of strategies related to education for entrepreneurship and articulation of these 
with the universities' substantive functions would support students' entrepreneurship culture, promoting different 
capacities to face occupational contexts. We developed a questionnaire under the Global University Entrepreneurial 
Spirit Students' Survey (GUESSS). The sample consisted of 224 students belonging to higher education institutions 
from the surgical instrumentation programs in Barranquilla, Colombia. The research results showed that the 
entrepreneurial intention increases in students to the extent that they have an adequate perception of business 
entrepreneurship and their confidence in managing and exploiting their capacities upon graduating from the academic 
program.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, there has been evidence that entrepreneurship plays a fundamental role as a strategic element in each 
country's continuous improvement. Nations have been able to take advantage of its benefits, turning it into a potential 
for its development and growth. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), a report that analyzes the 
rate of entrepreneurial activity in countries (TEA), presents that one of the stages of the business creation process is 
the ""intent."" For this reason, it is essential to recognize that the entrepreneurial process in an individual is achieved 
when all the functions, activities, and actions associated with the identification and exploitation of opportunities are 
integrated. Hence, the need to assume an attitude based on undertaking values, since both risk and economic gains, 
sacrifice or dedication, are characteristics attributed to the exercise of entrepreneurial activity (Robles and Pelekais, 
2015).

opportunities to achieve the objectives paths. They believe that taking risks is appropriate to get ahead and to be 
leaders of the process. 
 
4.4 Activities Related to Education and Alternatives to Promote Entrepreneurship Strategies 
The results show the strategies implemented, how to manage and disseminate knowledge, and the promotion of 
entrepreneurship in each Higher Education Institutions. We found that the activities related to entrepreneurship 
education in the surgical instrumentation program are only considered within the curricular plan in subjects of the last 
semester of their academic training. In business fairs, elective workshops, sessions, and entrepreneurship courses that 
students can take are not linked to this comprehensive training initiative. More articulation of the entrepreneurship 
component with the university's mission pillars such as research, teaching, and extension is necessary. In this way, it 
guarantees the integrality in the training of the future professional in surgical instrumentation. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
In Colombia, higher education institutions have made an effort to train high-quality professionals. In particular, the 
profession of surgical instrumentation has positioned itself as a discipline of human resources in health, where the 
professional acquires competencies that allow them to develop functions in the field of care, research, and social 
projection. Like many other Colombia professions, surgical instrumentation has undergone the transformation 
generated by a thirld world country needs and evolving to overcome its challenging scientific and technological issues. 
This research analyzes the entrepreneurial intention of Surgical Instrumentation students in Barranquilla, Colombia. 
The results indicate that in the entrepreneurial intention, there are no significant differences between the universities 
under study and the national average for higher education institutions, showing that there is a great aspiration on the 
part of the students to become entrepreneurs in both cases. 
 
Regarding the students' career intentions and entrepreneurial activity, the results show the degree's career intention as 
a professional and the career intention after five years of graduation. It is emphasized that once students finish their 
studies, they want to work in a company, which is aligned with previous editions of the GUESSS Project evidenced 
in Sieger et al. (2016). According to our study, students would be motivated to work in an SME or a large company, 
and they would like to start their entrepreneurship. The university has also allowed them to develop skills during the 
academic training process necessary to be an entrepreneur, which shows the significant contribution that higher 
education institutions are making in developing and appropriating these skills, essential in the comprehensive training 
of surgical instrumentation students. 
 
Likewise, the determinants of students' entrepreneurial intentions showed that universities are making efforts to 
promote entrepreneurship courses in their academic programs. However, there are still opportunities to expand 
entrepreneurship education. It is necessary to offer courses and activities related to entrepreneurship. It was evidenced 
in the higher education context that the university supports students to promote entrepreneurial endeavors. However, 
the success stories of entrepreneurs should be strengthened, and complementary entrepreneurship courses should be 
promoted. In the family context, a favorable environment is an indication of enhancing the entrepreneurship of the 
students. In the family nucleus and the community, entrepreneurship and family opinion are highly valued in the face 
of a possible failure to undertake a project; for this reason, the motivation for students to risk building their business 
must be encouraged. In the socio-cultural context, it was evidenced that students have tried to relate to people 
immersed in other areas of knowledge to learn from them and understand different visions.  
 
Regarding personal motivations, students have confidence and optimism about their future and have significant 
capacities, aptitudes, and qualities; they listen to others' opinions and consider perseverance to achieve their goals. 
They find the idea of starting their own business attractive and intend to start it after graduation. However, knowledge 
of the programs available to support entrepreneurs should be supported. Also, most students are not sure about the 
state's policies to finance entrepreneurship. They do not know what business incubators do, and they do not know the 
different programs to support entrepreneurs. 
 
Finally, when identifying activities related to entrepreneurship education in surgical instrumentation programs, it is 
evident that these activities are mostly developed from the curricular plan and voluntary complementary activities. 
Thus, a better articulation of the entrepreneurship component with the university's mission pillars is necessary.

2398","After analyzing the students' entrepreneurial intentions, it is proposed that higher education institutions implement 
other alternatives that sustenance the culture of entrepreneurship in surgical instrumentation students. Among the 
proposed strategies, it is worth emphasizing: 
 
1. The articulation of research and entrepreneurship, as suggested by Heredero and Jiménez (2013), 
entrepreneurship and research are linked in the same contexts. Both are integrated into the academy's 
conceptualizations and based on the current situation of reality, and understanding of different positions. 
2. Creation of entrepreneurship incubators, understanding these as playful learning spaces, in which the student 
can develop entrepreneurial skills and acquire critical competencies to be an entrepreneur. Robles and 
Pelekais (2015) state that these programs seek to create alternative extracurricular spaces that allow the 
development of culture and entrepreneurial and research training in business, academic, scientific, and 
technological fields. 
3. Entrepreneurship practices articulated with extension and social projection, Drayton (2005) points out that 
social entrepreneurs assume creativity as entrepreneurship practices. Social entrepreneurship acts in society, 
transforming through the detection of problems developing innovative solutions that provide new social 
behaviors. 
4. Bank of opportunities to create entrepreneurship, Leiva (2009:52) states that ""they are individuals dedicated 
to the search for opportunities, beyond the resources they have available."" This reflects that taking advantage 
of the potential of the individual in their ability to recognize the opportunities that arise can generate 
entrepreneurship through different strategies generating value. 
 
Some of these alternatives could support entrepreneurship culture in surgical instrumentation students, showing in it 
opportunities that the environment offers and empowering students with their entrepreneurial intentions and attitudes. 
Lastly, it should be noted that this research can serve as the beginning of a series of studies aimed at characterizing 
the entrepreneurial intention of students at any university and for any academic program as well as it can be used as a 
research reference in the different scientific associations and associations related to the discipline. Likewise, it can be 
disseminated within each higher education institution that serves as a model to generate similar studies in the health 
area programs offered.

Abstract  
 
Equipment replacement is an important decision all manufacturing companies must face, motivated by rising operating 
and maintenance costs or technological advances of assets. Although there are methods of analysis that indicate the 
necessity and the time equipment should be replaced, performance and expense data are required. The studied 
company has productive equipment to be replaced; however, its data have been insufficient for applying these 
methods. Thus, this study's purpose was to develop an asset management policy, focusing on critical assets 
replacement, based on ISO 55001:2014 requirements, with ISO 55002:2018 guidelines and alignment of financial and 
non-financial functions of ISO 55010:2019. Therefore, this work undertook a bibliographic review, and a case study 
has been carried out in a family-run medium-sized company located within the state of São Paulo. As a result, this 
work brings an asset management policy integrated into the organizational planning to guide and ensure the critical 
assets have the performance assured to deliver value to the company until its replacement. The development of this 
study has provided a support framework for asset replacement decision-making. Moreover, it enabled managers to 
understand how quality data availability can make the decision process safer and more professional.

1. Introduction  
 
Equipment replacement is an important decision all manufacturing companies must face, motivated by either rising 
operating and maintenance costs or technological advances of available assets in the market. (Hartman and Tan, 2014). 
However, equipment replacement is among the most relevant financial decisions since new equipment purchases are 
usually irreversible, involving high costs and compromising the company capital (Casarotto Filho and Kopittke, 2017).  
 
Asset replacement decisions must be based on accurate information about its conditions, through analysis and 
diagnosis, by ensuring, for the organization, the best return on invested capital, the best operating performance, and 
the lowest risk (Zampolli et al., 2019). Although there are methods of analysis that indicate the necessity and the time 
equipment should be discarded or replaced, performance and costs data of equipment are required.  
 
The Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) is the starting point for developing the asset management policy, 
strategy, objectives, and plans, which lead to the assets life cycle activities optimal combination - according to 
criticality, condition, performance, and the level of risk. As per the company's strategic planning and values, the policy 
represents the mandatory principles and requirements (ISO, 2014). In addition, high-level responsibilities may also be 
established in policy, as approving capital asset acquisition/replacement plans and reviewing asset performance. 
(Hastings, 2015). 
 
The studied company has productive equipment to be replaced; however, its data have been insufficient for applying 
these methods. Thus, for the construction of asset management policy focusing on equipment replacement, ISO 55001 
requirements, Context of the Organization, Leadership, and Planning have been carried out. Additional tools have 
been used to accomplish the requirements, such as SWOT analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat), 
Balanced Scored, among others. Based on the performance, costs, and risks indicators, the policy indicates which data 
should be pointed out by the various responsible areas defined in the SAMP so that the replacement analyses and 
decision-making be effective.

2401","The plans are concomitantly from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Corporate strategics are asset management 
objectives; asset management strategies are tactical and operational objectives; the compliance with operational plans 
ensures each asset's performance will incur in the execution of tactical plans and, finally, in the reach of strategic 
plans.   In summary, AM plans to achieve the respective objectives are: preventive maintenance plans to reduce 
failures; failure reduction, to ensure/increase reliability; increased reliability, to minimize downtime, to 
ensure/increase availability; reduction of unproductive hours (stops for corrective maintenance, cleaning, setup) to 
increase availability; minimize of corrective maintenance and energy diminution to reduce operating costs; elimination 
of operational bottlenecks to minimize capital costs; invest in more energy-efficient equipment, new facilities to 
reduce energy costs; replacement of assets and reduction of unproductive hours to ensure/increase capacity; 
replacement of equipment for technological updating and guarantee of the asset capability; alignment of data and 
technical and financial information of the equipment for substitution decisions. Furthermore, as long as the company 
does not parameterize its ERP to facilitate its access to assets data, and as long as there is no more extended data 
history that will become robust information, the asset AM policy matrix, and the asset dashboard will be used for 
critical assets. 
 
AM policy construction required the review of processes and procedures that already been existing in the organization. 
The policy structure demanded to build an asset management system aligned with organizational planning and 
integrate it with the quality management system, resulting in an integrated management system. Thus, the main 
research objective has been achieved. The company now has an asset management system with strategic, tactical, and 
operational purposes integrated into the organizational planning, and an asset management policy has been defined. 
Although their machines are the assets that generate value and sustain all the other company's assets, the organization 
underestimated them and their proper management at the beginning of the research.  When monitoring critical assets 
performance, which are the critical factors for achieving business objectives, the company ensures that they will fulfill 
the required tasks. Simultaneously, it will have a set of data that will become information relevant to replacing its 
machines. The company had not had contingency plans for its machines when this research started, and now it has 
plans for all of its equipment. That is, any machine will not stop the production line. A matrix has been created to 
monitor strategic and tactics indicators and dashboards to monitor operational indicators and a complete view of each 
asset part of the portfolio. Although the company has migrated from the reactive information stage to the preventive 
information stage, it is clear that quality data is still the greatest threat to AM objectives since the company continues 
to underuse its ERP and has not yet replaced its server. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
This work emerged from an equipment replacement and technological updating problem that would be strategical for 
the studied company. However, it could not be concluded due to a lack of operational data. As the work went on, it 
was clear that the company did not have an established policy on how its equipment was managed or how they were 
elected to be replaced, and it was the main problem. In addition, data were not reliable to the due replacement analysis. 
Just as the availability of quality data is a determining factor in decision-making, the success of implementing asset 
management, through the requirements of ISO 55001:2014, is intrinsically linked to the organizational culture, 
integration, and dynamic communication between departments. Only with leadership based on the example and visible 
commitment can asset management and information management be established. 
 
Search limitations 
The research's main limitation was time, as it could not follow the accomplishment of the other standard requirements. 
Future Research 
Although the research ends with this work, it is essential to state that consolidation and improvement in the company 
equipment management policy continue. It will be possible to realize a performance evaluation and a critical analysis 
when the company develops the other support requirements and effectively adheres to the AM Policy, SAMP, and 
actions to mitigate the risks. Thus, future studies will be able to monitor and analyze this evolution. 
Impacts on the Organization 
AMS's construction integrated with the QMS, SAMP, and asset management policy has initiated a new phase in the 
studied company in partnership with a consultant, manager, and employees. Moreover, it has provided a support 
framework for asset replacement decision-making. As it is a family-run company, this work also enabled managers to 
understand how quality data and organizational tools insertion can make the decision process safer and more 
professional. Assuming the company invests in training, uses its ERP effectively, and complies with the processes and

industries and perhaps nonexistent in medium-sized companies. 
It is expected that this research can guide other small and medium-sized companies, whose equipment is critical to the 
business success, and providing support to family-run companies, which do not have a professional with skills in asset 
management.

Abstract 
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought challenges of unprecedent proportions to the world in many aspects. For 
supply chain the key problem has been to minimize losses in short and long terms. The purpose of this article is 
to demonstrate the impact of covid-19 in the supply chain and international logistics perspectives and evaluate the 
impacts comparing with the standard supply chain operation model. The research method applied consists in a 
bibliographic research with qualitative and inductive approaches applied in a single case study. The results 
demonstrated different impacts on the macroprocesses of the standard model, however it is important to understand 
the changes on the degree of impact over time due to the initial contagion increase and the in the following months. 
The conclusion was that an emergency plan built by the company mitigated the impacts and avoided the supply 
disruption of imported materials. This work stands out for being unique inside the perspective of a covid-19 in vitro 
diagnostic company.

1. Introduction 
On March 11, 2020, WHO Director-General (2020), Tedros A. Ghebreyesus announced to the world that COVID- 
19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus, was a PAHO pandemic (2020). In recent years, the world has felt 
the impacts of other pandemics, such as the H1N1 flu in 2009 and Ebola in 2014, Patel et al. (2017). In these 
events, the same effects of excess demand, reduction of production capacity, dependence on suppliers from China 
and risk of supply cut were also perceived. These consequences, according to Wang et al. (2020) were also 
identified in China during the SARS outbreak in 2003. For Akkermans and Van Wassenhove (2018) it is possible 
to make a comparison of these events with tsunamis in nature, as both occur with a certain time spacing, have low 
predictability and high impact, therefore, are confused with isolated events. COVID-19, can be considered the 
biggest tsunami that affected supply chains in the 21st century, which according to Ivanov (2020) reinforces that 
epidemic outbreaks especially impact supply chains by causing prolonged interruptions, propagating these 
interruptions by whip effect and generating high uncertainty in companies. 
Resilience is presented as one of the advantages of the supply chain maturity model. Resilience is a term studied 
by many authors in recent years, such as Christopher and Peck (2004), Wied et al. (2020) and Chowdhury and 
Quaddus (2016). Christopher and Peck (2004) define resilience as the company's ability to return to its originais 
state or move-to a new desirable state after a disturbance. For Alicke and Azcue (2020), the low maturity of 
organizations' supply chains can be a risk and needs to be resolved. The term maturity in supply chains is addressed 
in the work of Oliveira (2009), Frederico (2012), Roque Júnior et al. (2019), Mendes et al. (2016), Miri et al. 
(2019), Yahiaoui et al. (2019). According to Oliveira (2009) and Frederico (2012), maturity models have been 
developed for evaluation in a specific domain of the organization based on a set of criteria. This process 
accelerated with the growth of globalization and the search for cost reduction. In recent years, supply chains have 
become globalized, trading products and services between different countries. This evolution increased the 
complexity of the environments since the competition was no longer for supply chains, but for supply chains. The 
complexity of these networks and the number of participating companies increase supply risks. 
According to Shekarian et al. (2020) several studies have been carried out on risk management, which shows that 
supply chains are subject to a wide variety of interruptions that can have an immediate or long-term effect. The 
world is fighting daily against COVID-19 and, more than ever, supply chains are essential for maintaining the 
supply of inputs for food, health and other essential items for human life today. According to Sorbello et al. (2020) 
COVID-19, which was initially treated as an isolated event, did not have a significant impact on supply chains,

4. Conclusions 
 
We further extended the analysis by applying Kaplan-Meier curves to evaluate age, hypertension, and diabetes as 
presented in Figure 1B. This assessment showed that all patients (100%) in the study with age range [70-103], 
hypertension, and diabetes died before (day thirteen) when compared to other patients that present different 
combinations of age and hypertension. These results indicate that those SARS-CoV-2 infected with diabetes, older 
age, and hypertension are at a higher risk of earlier death.   
 
Given that Colombia is currently starting its SARS-CoV-2 vaccination plan and the healthcare system, due to the 
outbreak, reaches high occupation levels, the developed evaluations provide a substantial reference of the underlying

Abstract 
 
In this paper, we study a pooled logistic system in which some enterprises share the same depot and fleet of vehicles to 
deliver products from the shared depots to customers. Genetic algorithm based on Clarke & Wright’s algorithm is 
proposed to solve the problem in order to minimize the total transportation cost which comprises of the total cost of 
shipping the products from enterprises to the shared depot, and the total cost of all the trips that deliver the products to 
the customers. The proposed algorithm was applied on a benchmark instance of a vehicle routing problem adapted to 
the pooled transportation problem. The results confirm the rooms of cost reduction if the pooled logistic will be applied.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, optimizing a supply chain is getting a great importance since it has a significant effect on product's 
cost, CO2 emissions and level of customer service. This optimization was based only on the economic level for long 
time but now the optimization is happening by integrating both economic, environmental and societal issues which 
are the objectives of sustainable development (Rosen and Kishawy 2012). 
Urban distances represent 28% of the total cost even though these distances is a small part of the total travelled 
distances (Roca-Riu and Estrada 2012) and 16% to 50%  is estimated of air pollution emissions due to transport 
activities in cities (Battaia et al. 2014). Therefore, improving the efficiency of road transport is a challenge not only 
in terms of optimizing transport costs but also in terms of reducing the environmental footprint. 
Based on the statistics of the European Environment Agency, load of truck transporting cargo are generally at an 
average of 50 % (Abate 2014). The load factor is an index of the utilization of the available capacity of the used trucks.  
This is an important room of improvement. Certainly, getting a higher load factor will considerably reduce the freight 
traffic volume and consequently will reduce the transportation cost and the Greenhouse Gas emissions. 
Adopting a pooled logistic system is one of the solutions proposed by researchers to make a new logistic system 
and overcome these challenges. The pooled logistic system is a cooperation between independent supply chains to 
build a common supply chain network by sharing the depots and transportation vehicles that yields reduced costs of 
warehousing and transportation compared to the classical logistics. Indeed, it permits more important delivery 
frequencies to the customers, improves the utilization of vehicles, and improves ecological impacts. 
Collaborative supply chain is a business partnership between two or more companies to achieve common goals. 
It is differentiated depending on its structure into vertical collaboration, horizontal collaboration and lateral 
collaboration (Simatupang and Sridharan 2002). European Union (Union 2001) defined horizontal collaboration as 
""concerted practices among companies operating at the same level(s) in the market"". 
(Moutaoukil et al. 2012) did a large-scale revision and introduced a conceptual framework for the pooling supply 
chain implementation as horizontal collaborative logistics strategy. The authors found a similarity between pooling 
supply chain and horizontal collaboration strategies. 
(Pan et al. 2014) proposed three different pooling scenarios and compared with the existing transport organization 
of the food industry in western France to evaluate cost and emission levels of CO2. The methodology consisted in 
accessing a current situation through a survey of the flow of goods at one of the main distribution center of the studied 
supply network, then comparing this situation with three other pooling scenarios.

2432","Table 2 and Table 3 contain two levels: the first level is the assignment of enterprises to the selected depots, the 
distance and the cost of trucks routes from each enterprise to its assigned depot. The second level contains the number 
of vehicle routes from each selected depot, and both the distance and cost of these vehicle routes. In addition to these 
two levels, a cumulative demand of customers in all routes from each selected depot is presented. 
In a pooled logistic version as shown in Table 2, depot 2 is allocated to enterprises (3 and 5), depot 4 is allocated 
to enterprises (1 and 2) and depot 5 is allocated to enterprises (0, 4, and 6). From each selected depot, a routing plan 
is established using Clarke and Wright’s Saving algorithm to deliver customers’ demand with seven routes from depot 
2, eight routes from depot 4, and twelve routes from depot 5.  The total first level distance =178.1538-unit distance 
and the total second level distance = 2025.99-unit distance. Therefore, the total transportation distance = 2204.1438-
unit distance, and the corresponding total transportation cost is 2738.6052-unit cost/unit distance. 
Similarly, the results for the classical logistic system as presented in Table 3 showed that for each enterprise, a 
unique depot is allocated to it and a routing plan from these depots with four routes is established using Clarke and 
Wright’s Saving algorithm to deliver customers’ demand. The total transportation distance and the total transportation 
cost for the classical logistic system is equal to 3628.213-unit distance and 4147.221-unit cost/unit distance, 
respectively. The comparison of the first level and second level costs for both the classical logistic system and the 
pooled logistic system is visually represented in Figure 3. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Comparison of cost of the proposed logistic systems 
 
The results show that the collaboration between each group of enterprises to share the same depot and fleet of 
vehicles reduces the total transportation distance and the total transportation cost to deliver products from enterprises 
to customers through selected depots. The savings in the total transportation distance and the total transportation cost 
by adopting a pooled logistic system in the studied instance are 1424.0689-unit distance and 1408.616-unit 
distance/unit cost, respectively. Furthermore, the number of customers visited by each vehicle is reduced due to the 
cumulative demand of the collaborating enterprises. On the other hand, vehicles in the classical logistic system have 
to visit more customers in order to improve the utilization of their vehicles. However, this action results in long 
distances travelled by vehicles. 
In the proposed GA, there is a repetitive calling of CWS algorithm in each chromosome of each population and 
for each generation. However, implementing CWS algorithm to evaluate fitness of a chromosome helped us to obtain 
good results in a suitable amount of time. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper, genetic algorithm and Clarke & Wright’s saving algorithm are proposed for the assignment of 
enterprises to depots and the routing of vehicles from depots to customers. The objective is to study the impact of a 
pooled logistic system in reducing the total transportation cost as compared with noncollaboration between enterprises. 
Computational results obtained from an instance adapted from the literature showed that the pooling logistic version 
outperforms the classical logistics in reducing the total transportation cost. Moreover, the utilization of vehicles is

Abstract 
Increased vehicular queuing inside universities has amounted to pressing concerns for staff and students, distorting 
their time schedules to reach classes and office buildings on time. This paper attempts to alter the traditional 
transportation service behavior within university campuses to reduce traffic congestions and facilitate system 
effectiveness and reliability through a modeling-based routing and optimization approach. A qualitative conceptual 
model using a system thinking approach identifies the relationships and feedback between university shuttle bus 
system effectiveness, service performance, and traffic congestion. A bi-objective goal programming optimization 
model is developed and used to select the best alternative routes for university shuttle bus services during congested 
peak hours considering a continuous-circulation feeder mode. Qatar University shuttle bus service network is taken 
as the case for model implementation. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to verify the daily bus capacity, ensuring 
that the chosen alternative routes met the expected demand. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to identify the 
most sensitive bus stops along the best-selected routes. Results showed that the proposed alternative routes improved 
the system effectiveness by 75% and the alternative proposed routes satisfied the stations' daily demand.  
 
Keywords: Bi-objective optimization; Monte Carlo simulation; sensitivity analysis, system thinking; traffic 
congestion. 
1. Introduction 
Traffic congestion is a complex dynamic problem that leads to unconventional transportation patterns and 
unprecedented impacts on the system life cycle and effectiveness, distorting the existing idealistic settings tranquility 
(Papageorgiou et al. 2009; and Cao et al. 2016). The steadily increasing enrollment rates at universities have resulted 
in the irrational use of transportation infrastructures around the campus, leading to traffic congestion (Bustillos et al. 
2011). Eliminating hyper-congestion within the university premises to ease mobility has been the focus of debate over 
the past decade for transportation planners and university authorities. Apart from the high number of vehicles and 
weak in-house transportation service usage (Bruck et al. 2017), irrational use of road resources exacerbates traffic 
congestion during peak hours (Bakar et al. 2018). Pressing concerns on sustainable utilization of resources has resulted

2440",,"1. Enhance the service frequency of shuttle bus services where routes can be split into multiple service points 
covering the same area. The too-frequent stopping of buses at various service points can cause students to reach 
late at their respective destinations. 
2. Re-allocate the resources to meet the intra-campus service needs based on latent demand and identify the under-
served stops or areas within the university campus. 
3. Improve the on-time service performance by downsizing the number of bus stops along the planned bus routes. 
For the same, universities can conduct a survey to know the willingness of students to commute on foot and then 
re-allocate the bus stops. 
4. Re-design process of the routes can be done to shift the current existing pattern of loop routes in the campuses 
like Qatar University to either of the following pattern of routes, namely; a) Split routes b) Linear routes c) Express 
routes and, d) Through routes, which can possibly reduce the congestion within the university campus. 
5. Use of Internet of things (IoT) technology to enhance internal transportation services. Bus drivers will only stop 
in stations to drop off or pick up students based on their request (student request will be sent as a signal to the bus 
drivers) to avoid delays or unnecessary stops. 
6. Determine prominent route measurement parameters that can be used for computing the shuttle service 
performance on a timely basis. These measures include; 
a) Student trips per service miles (per student trips and route service miles) 
b) Student trips per service hours (per student trips with route service hours) 
c) Real-time performance (student entry and exit data from each stop) 
d) Number of service-related complaints (create a channel to accept transportation-related complaints from 
students). 
 
For future research, the authors suggest using several machine intelligent tools for shuttle bus service design and 
development related problems such as the time-optimal speed setting design model developed by Bae et al., for 
improving the service reliability during unlikely events for self-driving university shuttle bus services (Bae et al. 
2019). Similarly, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based visualization map with Satellite Navigation (SatNav) system 
that measures the headcount of students using bus services based on course enrollment as developed by 
Somsuphaprungyos et al., can be used (Somsuphaprungyos et al. 2015). This technology supports the shuttle bus 
management system in accordance with the student movement within the university premises. Decision support 
systems with fuzzy architectures like the ""Trans Jakarta Fuzzy Interface Systems (TJFIS)"" developed by Samosir et 
al., reduce considerable amount of uncertainties in fleet management for shuttle bus services (Samosir et al. 2017). 
Despite the fact that numerous methods and techniques exist till date, the service system design problems are of a 
class of NP-hard problem. In real time situations, several scenarios need to be run to obtain a near optimal, optimal or 
sub-optimal result. There might be unrealistic scenarios that might result in computational delays. In addition, 
scenarios such as change in conditions like road closures, service breakdowns etc. can make daily operations more 
complex and proper planning a complex task.

Abstract 
 
Micro enterprises are key contributors in nation building in terms of job creation and income generation. 
The sector of micro enterprises, along with other small sized enterprises, is very important in the economic 
development of all countries in the world. In today’s business world of complexities and competitiveness, 
micro enterprises need to adapt appropriate strategies to grow and become sustainable. In this context, the 
concept of sustainable supply chain management in the operation strategy of micro enterprises is apparently 
a vital function along with quality management that impact business performance. The objective of this 
study is to identify the relationships of sustainability drivers to quality management practices and supply 
chain practices that both impact supply chain environmental sustainability performance of Philippine micro 
enterprises, particularly in the food service industry. Thus, it is fittingly of interest to have a supply chain 
environmental sustainability model for foodservice micro-enterprises incorporating sustainability factors 
and significant relationships among these factors and practices in quality management and supply chain 
management. The paper uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and data from 454 survey respondents 
from the foodservice micro enterprise sector to analyze the posited relationships and strength of 
interrelationships of different factors for a good model fit.

1. Introduction 
 
Green supply chain management (GSCM) has been acknowledged as a key factor to promote organizational 
sustainability and is evolving into an important approach for organizations in emerging economies to manage their 
environmental responsibility. Yet, despite their importance for easing environmental degradation and providing 
economic benefits, study of the drivers that influence green supply chain initiatives in an emerging economy is still 
an under-researched area (Hsu, Choon Tan, Hanim Mohamad Zailani & Jayaraman, 2013).  
 
Business firms concerned with sustainable development have a good reputation and environmental image in its 
industry. By covering all its three aspects - economic, environmental and social, its implementation proposes that 
micro-enterprises can become a profitable firm while mitigating damages in the environment. Business activities pose 
a significant threat to the environment in terms of carbon monoxide emissions, discarded packaging supplies, scrapped 
materials, improper disposal of wastewater and other forms of pollution resulting from their supply chain and quality 
management practices (Wisner JD, Tan K-C, Leong GK, 2012). 
 
Improving supply chain environmental sustainability performance will be both a challenge and an opportunity in a 
business. The role of the sustainability drivers is crucial in motivating firms to adopt green supply chain initiatives 
and facilitate their adoption. Firms in emerging countries need to realize that green supply chain initiatives and

Abstract  
 
The front-end design of the Additional Mining Vessel 3 (AMV3) is based on the current mv Mafuta (MFT) design, 
comprising of a crawler that is used to recover material from the seabed. This material is then pumped through a 
700NB riser pipe to a four-way splitter, whose discharge reports to the static drain panels. The main focus of this study 
is to use experimental methods to explore the feasibility of an alternative Dewatering Bin concept (Lamella Clarifier) 
that can successfully operate in the unique mining environment, with the increase in operating capacity without 
jeopardizing the dewatering bins operational efficiency. Using the existing Mafuta mining vessel which uses four

1. Introduction  
Lamella clarifier development study is highlighted. The study looks at the marine mining activities conducted at De 
Beers Marine (DBM) along the coast of Namibia. It refers to the mining equipment used and how technological 
improvements of this nature can improve efficiency with respect to production rate. The study focuses on the 
theoretical concept of the existing dewatering device and the introduction of a lamella clarifier as an alternative 
dewatering unit that can successfully operate in the unique mining environment for case study 1 and case study 2 
explores dimensioning of a steel structure of rectangular tank. Theories and principles behind the different techniques 
used for separation of particles have a major role in society. More specifically as the need for ocean resources 
increases. The current dewatering bin was found to lose +1.4mm diamonds as the feed rate increases, which potentially 
affects the diamond recovered. Further dewatering bin concepts have been explored by means of CFD analysis by the 
DBM R&D department, to further develop the existing dewatering design for the deployment of production vessels. 
A need existed to develop, design and manufacture a scale model that will demonstrate the performance of the concept 
based on a lamella clarifier which is originally used in wastewater industries. The objectives of the was to; 
• 
Review a case study and study methods of simulation 
• 
Develop a 1:7 scale detailed design model of the alternative de-watering bin concept. 
• 
Fabricate a test rig that will allow for quantitative and qualitative test work.  
• 
Test the throughput potential of the lamella clarifier.

Abstract  
 
As the South African population grows, so too is the demand for clean water. There are numerous methods that have 
been developed over the years for cleaning water. Water purification technologies at Veolia Water Technologies The 
main focus of this study is to use literature to get a fundamental understanding of Clarification technologies. study 
presents the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of an Actiflo Clarifier designed by Veolia Wastewater Technologist in 
Johannesburg, South Africa. Various aspects are investigated in this study. The Actiflo Clarifier stiffeners are assumed 
to meet the Euler buckling criterion. The maximum deflection occurs at the top of the tank where the actual pressure 
is far less than the 40kPa at the bottom of the tank which was assumed to be the maximum pressure acting constantly 
along the walls of the Actiflo. Various parameters such as fatigue failure, design variables, as well as the different 
stiffener positions and sections used to determine the local bucking points of the rectangular structure are tested in the 
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) environment using Ansys. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to determine the 
critical zones of large deformations and stresses as well as to test theoretical principles.

1. Introduction  
The main purpose of clarifiers in a treatment scheme is to remove solids from liquids by sedimentation, remove scum 
from liquid by flotation and thicken solids for removal and further treatment applications. Specific application of 
clarifier functions will be dependent upon the treatment process employed. This study is a discussion of what has been 
accounted by prior researchers on wastewater industries as well as the development of clarifiers. This review is focused 
on five major themes which emerge repeatedly through the literature reviewed. These themes are: wastewater 
industries, Conventional wastewater treatment processes, Clarifiers, Chambers within a clarifier, rectangular 
structures of a tank and the application of FEM. Theories and principles behind the different techniques used for 
designing clarifiers have a role in how designs can be optimized. To effectively optimize the design of an Actiflo 
clarifier thorough research is required to identify how the thickness of the shell, stiffeners used, and the locations of 
the stiffeners can affect the Actiflo. The motivation of the research is to gain fundamental knowledge of how clarifiers 
work and investigate how they have been designed by other researchers. 
2. Literature Review  
2.1.  Wastewater Treatment Industries 
Wastewater treatment industries developed in the 19th century, where large cities began to understand that they had 
to reduce the number of pollutants found in the water that had to discharge into the environment. Despite large supplies 
of fresh water and the natural ability of water to cleanse itself over time, populations had become so concentrated by 
1850 that outbreaks of life-threatening diseases were traced to bacteria in the polluted water (Anon., 2017). Since that 
time, the practice of wastewater collection and treatment has been developed and perfected, using some of the most

2464","The spacing between the plates is generally between 2.5 and 5 cm for drinking water facilities and 5 to 10 cm in 
wastewater treatments. The effective horizontal surface is the horizontal projection of each plate multiplied by plates 
number. This total projected surface value is used to calculate the hydraulic loading rate. An important factor to take 
into consideration is the critical scour velocity (y, 2003). The hydraulic loading rate can be achieved through Equation

The foregoing results in more compact equipment and with surface requirements considerably lower than in  
conventional circular and rectangular clarifiers. Laminar or tubular clarifiers are also called high rate settling units 
(D., 2007). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The aim of this study was to effectively investigate methods of optimizing the Actiflos stiffeners. This could not be 
done without thorough research of how parameters such as the Actiflo wall thickness, stiffener configurations used, 
optimal stiffener locations as well as identifying local buckling points. The Actiflo was designed in accordance to the 
volume required per chamber which covers the most important aspect of an Actiflo operation however no structural 
analysis was done to investigate the number of stiffeners required to resist the internal hydrostatic forces, the type of 
stiffeners to be used and ideal locations to place stiffeners. This structure was therefore classified as statically 
indeterminate beam with a VDL (varying distributed load). Simulating software’s such as ANSYS are power tools 
that can give any organization massive upgrades cutting time of applying manual theoretical calculations, solving 
complex structures, mitigating any risks by identifying failures prematurely before they occur, this may also cut any 
manufacturing costs.

Abstract 
 
Water is a major component of all living matter, which when pure is an odourless, tasteless, only slightly 
compressible liquid that appears bluish in dense layers, freezes at 0 ° C and boils at 100 ° C. This design intends 
to address the problem of water scarcity in the rural area of South Africa with KwaZulu-Natal as case study, by 
designing an atmospheric water generator that will obtain water from the atmosphere. The atmosphere has about 
0% to 4% of water available as water vapor. The present technologies of harvesting water from the atmosphere 
are differentiated into three: the cooling condensing type, wet desiccant type and Peltier effect type. Concept 
were generated and a final design was developed that works using a fan and solar power, with the aid of the 
temperature difference in the soil and the atmosphere to condense the water vapour into water. Under favoarable 
conditions the atmospheric water generator is able to produce 23 l/day of water.

1. Introduction 
Water is a liquid that when pure is an odourless, tasteless, only slightly compressible liquid that appears bluish 
in dense layers, freezes at 0 ° C and boils at 100 ° C  (AR Controls, 2020). Water is a precious resource with 
only 3% available as fresh water. Of which only 1% is easily accessible, the remainder 2% is inaccessible. 
Water is a scarce resource with 2.2 billion people having limited access (UN-Water, 2015). Many rivers, 
streams, and aquifers have dried up or have become too toxic to be used. Today more than half of wetlands 
(lakes) have gone missing. The increasing population, agriculture activities and pollution (UN-Water, 2015) 
mostly cause scarcity of water. Sub-Saharan Africa has the most water stressed countries of any area (WWF, 
2020). This design seeks to address the problem of water scarcity in the rural area of of South Africa using 
KwaZulu-Natal as case study, by designing an atmospheric water generator that will obtain water from the 
atmosphere. The atmosphere has about 0% to 4% of water available as water vapor. The system of condensing 
water from the atmosphere dates to the sixth century, were ancient Greeks used the system to build large dew 
condenser to harvest water vapor. The present technologies of harvesting water from the atmosphere are 
differentiated into many types but only three will be considered in this project that is: cooling condensing type, 
wet desiccant type and Peltier effect type (Thisani, 2018). The three types differ by the way they condense water 
vapor to water, that is the cooling condensation type of AWG uses refrigeration technology (Thisani et al,

2474","6.4 Social Impact  
Water scarcity has become a problem as water demand is increasing with the increase of populations. The 
design will solve the problem of water scarcity and will impact the livelihood of communities. The water 
produced is of good quality with low mineralisation without biological contaminants. Water produced can be 
used for different needs such as food preparation, human consumption and agriculture. 
6.5 Health impact 
The water produced by the atmospheric water generator is of high quality that will improve the health of 
individuals that use the product. Water in most South African rural communities is not pure water or purified 
water but water that is contaminated that needs to be purified further. This often leads to diseases such as 
cholera in the townships. The use of the design will greatly reduce spread of such disease. Cholera is a disease 
that causes diarrhoea, dehydration, and may lead to death if treatment is not carried out.  
6.6 Environment Impact 
Atmospheric water generation is a source of renewable source of clean, pure water. The humidity in the air is 
water contained in the atmosphere as water vapour which is a natural source. The design uses renewable energy 
in the form of solar energy therefore does not impact the environment in a negative manner. Atmospheric water 
generator is design in such a way that less energy is used, the construction of the water generator will only use 
non-renewable energy which affects the environment.    
7. Conclusion 
 
Water is a basic need, water scarcity in the world is a problem as pollution keep on increasing at an exponential 
rate. The water scarcity in South Africa is caused by a lot of factors including climate change. All provinces are 
affected including KwaZulu-Natal. Rural KwaZulu-Natal is facing a major problem in water scarcity and a 
problem in clean water that is safe to drink and irrigate crops (Thisani et al, 2017). The objective of this paper is 
to develop a solution to address this problem. The solutions thus investigated are of two types were the air is 
dehumidified and filtrated above ground level using electricity and another were air is dehumidified below 
ground level, using solar power during the day and battery stored energy at night. The cost of the product is 
estimated to be less than R10 000.00. The final solution to the problem was the dehumidify below ground level 
type of atmospheric water generator, that can produce water from water vapor. The atmospheric water generator 
is able to produce 23 l/day of water, but under unfavorable conditions, that is when temperature is below 15oC 
combined with a relative humidity ratio of 65% or less, no water is produced.

Abstract 
 
Insufficient supply of electricity has necessitated research in renewable energy fields such natural gas 
power plants. Many diseases in society today are traced to greenhouse gases that are emitted into the 
atmosphere from many power plant operations. Boilers are the main components for electricity 
generation but they have high carbon footprint and provide insufficient steam to generate sufficient 
electricity. Natural gas power plant boilers was designed as a cost effective alternative to satisfying 
electricity demand and carbon footprint reduction .The boiler is used in power plant to produce high 
pressured steam and passes it into a turbine to power the generator to generate  electricity. Three 
concepts were developed and rated with the one with highest score chosen. The model in this paper is 
novel since some features were added in this project. 
 
Keywords 
Steam, Natural gases, electricity, greenhouse effect, boiler, turbine design concept. 
 
1. Introduction 
The boiler of natural gas power plant was designed to generate electricity while reducing carbon 
footprint and cost. Boilers in power plants are used to produce high pressured steam, so that electricity 
will be generated. This process of generating electricity is known as rankine cycle. It must be taken 
into consideration that this type of boiler should not release harmful gases to atmosphere because it 
may result to global warming which is caused by greenhouse gases that are emitted by energy sources 
to the atmosphere and the temperature on earth will gradually increase. 
South Africa as a country is facing the problem lack of sufficient electricity to meet all the customers 
demand. .To overcome this problem more boilers of natural gas must be designed to boost electricity 
supplied to the customers meets demand. The main goal of designing a boiler of a gas power plant is 
to extract as much of the energy from the fuel as possible. In this design cow dung (as natural gas) is

There is a lot of noise from power plants causing partial deafness [9]. 
7. Conclusion 
The design of a boiler of natural gas power plant to generate electricity at low cost and reduction in 
carbon footprint is the aim of this paper. The model reported in this paper generates electricity but is 
expensive to construct and maintenance. For this reasons, the superheater was introduced into the 
boiler to increase the temperature and pressure of steam so that the highly pressured steam will leave 
the boiler at a very high speed to increase the rotation in the turbine to generate electricity. It was 
noted that some exhaust gases leave the boiler with some heat which was going to be useful in 
increasing in the efficiency of a cycle in the boiler. As a result heat absorber was introduced before 
the end of exhaust gas duct.

Abstract 
 
South Africa (SA) is highly dependent on the state utility ESKOM for electric power supply. This 
includes big companies and tourism sectors in SA. For the very first time in history, SA has had the OR 
Tambo international airport (one of the busy airports in SA) switch off to darkness. This was due to the 
boiler failures at the power stations owned by the state utility ESKOM. These types of boilers are fired 
with the use of coal and they produce a reasonable amount of Carbon dioxide (CO2) and soot to the 
atmosphere. This paper details the design of a gas turbine that can drive an electric generator to produce 
electricity for the OR Tambo international airport in Johannesburg, the King Shaka international airport 
in Durban and the Cape Town international airport.  
 
Specifications of the design were made and are as follows: the gas engine aims to have a mass of 
1 000kg or less, the work produced is specified to be more than 500 kW with an efficiency of 35 % or 
more. The mass of the engine after preliminary analysis is determined to be 1 180.965 kg (i.e. 18 % 
more than the specified mass), the work that can be produced by the engine is calculated to be 811.59 
kW with an efficiency of 40.34 %. The material cost is analyzed to be R 107 787.77 or $ 7000. 
 
Safety considerations, maintenance and repair of the designed gas turbine are also documented in this 
paper. The social, economic, heath, and environment impacts of the design are clearly stated. The gas 
turbine generator aims to use natural gas as fuel. Natural gas power generation has almost no emission 
of CO2 and soot. The gas turbine design has the significant potential to decrease the expenditure on 
ESKOM electricity demand.

5.1 Cost Analysis 
The cost of materials is shown in the Table 1. The mass of each components was investigated using 
CAD software and the cost of material per kilogram was also investigated. The total cost of material is 
R 107 787.77. The cost for machining (using multi-axis CNC machine) the subcomponents is estimated 
to be R 540 000 ($ 36 000) and the cost of assembling is estimated to be R 91 619.60 ($ 6 107.97). 
5.2 Other Design Considerations 
The gas turbine will be equipped with accessories to provide safe and reliable operation:  
• 
Inlet air filters 
• 
Metal acoustical enclosures  
• 
Double lube oil coolers  
• 
Dry low NOx combustion system  
• 
Compressor wash system 
• 
Fire detection and protection system 
The gas turbine designed for ease of maintenance and service. Both casing of the engine (compressor 
and turbine casing) may disassemble into two separate symmetric parts. Components such as fuel 
nozzles, induction valves, wiring, bearings, and sensors replaced by buying new ones from the gas 
component sellers. 
The potential ecological impacts identified in the operation of the gas turbine generator are: (i) water 
pollution from oil wastes and/or spills used for the maintenance of apparatus, (ii) noise resulting from 
the operation of the turbine, (iii) air pollution resulting from the stack emissions during power 
generation. All these wastes with possible influences on the surroundings are handled with latest 
technology available in accordance with the relevant country wide and global legal framework.

Abstract 
 
The bottling of biogas, a renewable energy source that uses anaerobic organic waste digestion, 
improves the rural economy by consolidating the use of biogas. In remote areas in South Africa, new 
opportunities are emerging through reducing their living costs by self-producible fuel. Bottled raw 
biogas can be placed on the market as a fuel or for biogas upgrades. This lower-cost bottling device 
cost less than ZAR 5000 and can be used with low technical skills, in particular with respect to safety 
precautions. For various uses, including electricity generation, car charging, and heating, bottled 
upgraded biogas is used. The side product, slurry, is sold as a healthy fertilizer. The biogas bottling 
system motivates villagers to use their waste to generate biogas and allows new income opportunities 
by better management of organic waste while maintaining a hygienic lifestyle. The system is expected 
to run on average per unit of time with a bio-digester of 6 cubic meters square. This paper presents the 
development of a simple biogas filing machine concept to be used in rural areas of South Africa.

Abstract 
 
This research aims to determine how appreciative inquiry promoted the culture of innovation in an engineering school 
and based on the results that were obtained to propose a plan of activities. Appreciative inquiry took place in a school 
of industrial engineering at the university in northern Peru, where thirty-seven students participated. These students 
participated through interviews and surveys by inquiring them about the best of what they have done in order to 
imagine what could be. Then a survey is conducted to determine the student perception of corporate style about the 
industrial engineering program (IEP). Analyzing the data, the hypothesis is accepted: that appreciative inquiry has 
promoted the culture of innovation in the industrial engineering program. This can be evidenced in the participation 
in more academic events, meeting and courses, in national and international calls about innovation, etc. Results 
obtained by students forced to the IEP to a greater participation and involvement in a process towards a culture of 
innovation.

1. Introduction 
Universities have a close commitment to companies because they are an organization with greater management 
experience in the transfer of knowledge and technology to companies. It is a duty that the university has to share 
knowledge through its graduates, but its greatest responsibility is to motivate and stimulate a culture of change in its 
students, making known what they do, because the existence of good innovative ideas is evident, which are they reflect 
in the medium term, in new business opportunities, process or product improvement and business diversification. 
 
When the university is present or absent from society, a space is created to generate positive or negative impacts on 
it, being competitiveness the most susceptible factor (Ruesga and Da Silva 2007). One of the critical components of 
innovation is the development of human talent, because they are the essence of the process (Peláez 2013), therefore 
professional training must be reoriented in such a way that it not only responds to the market need, with an added

the students, who were part of the appreciative interview because they are the main consumers of the service provided 
by the school and the reference before the society. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the school's corporate style, 
whose responses were grouped by similarity and yielded the following results (Table 6):

It exists but there are still teachers who do not communicate even 
formally.

5. Discussion and conclusions 
According to the results, it can be observed that the role of the teacher is fundamental to promote creativity and 
innovation in the industrial engineering program, which does not necessarily involve having professors specialized in 
the subject of innovation, since students do not remain every day in a single course, but face an average of 4 to 6 
courses with their own particularities (teacher, methodology, environment and evaluation system). In this case, and 
according to the results, the student finds in the support and confidence that the teacher can provide, the necessary 
complement to express their ideas or assimilate in a meaningful way the new knowledge provided. 
 
Teamwork, good treatment and trust are immersed within the academic-administrative management of the program's 
direction, which must provide the necessary infrastructure so that the initiative, creativity, interest in continuous 
improvement, does not fade or is a particular characteristic of only some courses. The commitment and continuity of 
the efforts made and being made need a coherent macro environment to achieve an innovative program.

2522","In turn, the good informal communication that exists between teachers and students is not enough to establish a 
corporate management style that allows me to achieve a good culture of innovation, the management of the industrial 
engineering program must assume a greater role in its commitment to continuous improvement. But informal 
communication can be used to promote or find a mechanism to recognize the improvement contributions made by 
students or teachers, in order to close the communication gaps between the program and students. 
 
Although the appreciative process helps to motivate through positive thinking, influencing the values and emotions of 
the students, the process, which should have been continuous, had a period of silence. But it was taken up again in the 
following period, since the study group was once again responsible and the process could be resumed. At the beginning 
it was not easy to rescue only the positive attitude, because negative aspects were brought up, but with the support of 
two other colleagues it was possible to focus the interviews and dialogues on the positive factors. 
 
The culture of innovation can be measured from different points of view, but the most appropriate dimension must be 
selected, according to the type of company and the level of innovative culture that the company has. In this case, it 
was considered to evaluate the corporate style with which the school is managed, from the students' point of view. 
 
Appreciative inquiry promoted the innovation culture of industrial engineering students at a Peruvian university. 
Regardless of the policy of the program management, students participated in the course of the last two years in 
national competitions, where they won prizes. At the international level, they participated in the Mission Mars 
competition organized by NASA and were invited with their projects to live the experience. With another group of 
students, we worked on their research proposals with a view to publishing their results, and an average of eight 
scientific articles have been published to date in an indexed university journal, confirming the objective of this 
research.

Abstract 
The current accelerated social, environmental, economic and technological transformations require higher education 
to train professionals who respond to these realities, solve problems more quickly and transform society to achieve 
its survival. On this basis, the National University of San Agustín (UNSA), within the framework of the educational 
change governed in Peru by University Law 30220, began a process of curricular transformation by competencies, 
for the continuous academic improvement that is currently claimed . In this context, a proposal is presented on the 
formation of basic formative research competencies for engineering students, based on the experience developed in 
the School of Systems Engineering that shows, through two subjects in the first years of studies: Writing of 
Research Articles and Reports and Research and Writing Methods; the methodological strategy applied and the 
results obtained.

1. Introduction 
Among the changes that are incorporated in the National University of San Agustín (UNSA) of Arequipa, the 
elaboration of a new Educational Model from the participation of all the actors is highlighted. Model that has made 
it possible to assimilate international training standards in the formulation of curricular plans, with the aim of 
international recognition of professional careers. Among the new changes, basic formative research has been 
incorporated; a process that has allowed the transformation and improvement of the entire curriculum in all careers 
and programs available to the university. 
The constant advances that involve the different fields of engineering, make society and organizations require 
professionals with increasingly particular skills and emphasized in the development of investigative capacities. This 
is reflected in the competences that the international accrediting agency ABET (2020) (Accreditation Board for 
Engineering and Technology) recommends possessing all engineering graduates; Therefore, the concern of study 
programs is centered on: how to transmit or teach them, recognize their implications for an engineering student, 
assess the need for their learning and generate actions to achieve the knowledge, attitudes and skills involved in this 
process teaching-learning. 
This work includes the proposal developed in the Professional School of Systems Engineering (EPIS) (2020) of the 
National University of San Agustín de Arequipa (UNSA) from the application of the curricular changes and 
improvements developed in the study plan of 2017 to date. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The impact of technological transformations in the area of studies and the training of professionals dedicated to this 
field; as well as the changes and the university improvement guided the present investigation that is proposed as an

Given the nature of the subjects that requires a transversal approach, it is important to have a better knowledge base 
of the career that allows a greater apprehension of the applied content; particularly in the MIR course, which is why 
it has been considered that it should be located at a higher intermediate level of the curriculum, and in turn, that it is 
considered a transversal axis in the training of all university students. Cabero_Almenara (2020); Guerra (2019). 
Likewise, it is convenient to redefine the number of participating students, in order to enable a more personalized 
and student-centered academic accompaniment. Bedregal and Padron (2020); Santana and Perez (2020); Hernandez 
(2019). 
In this sense, in addition, the insufficiency of the number of hours assigned per week has been verified, being 
necessary its increase, with which the efficiency of the teaching work and the fulfillment of the objectives of the 
subjects from the integration and participation of the teachers who intervene in this year and in this group of 
students, for the formation of the competences that are oriented from the profile of the graduate. Paz and Padron 
(2020); Vidal-Duarte and Padron (2020). 
 
There is a tendency to adopt applied research problems and cases, linked to specific practical situations; many of 
them with multidisciplinary content, which requires support and links with an external specialist. The direct 
participation of EPIS teachers is important, through their role as external consultants specializing in the area, thereby 
promoting the promotion of student research skills. This own curricular line of formative research is decisive to 
capture the end-of-degree work, through the Thesis Project and Thesis Seminar subjects developed in the last year of 
professional training and which are included as a terminal component of the study plan; which support and allow the 
obtaining of the academic degree and the professional qualification. 
 
In the exposed analysis, the methodological strategy followed for the formation of basic formative research 
competencies is evidenced, through two subjects in the first years of training: Writing of Articles and Research 
Reports and Research and Writing Methods. The results obtained, as well as their validation through the use of 
scientific methods, allow to demonstrate the fulfillment of the foreseen objective; since it shows the methodological 
strategy and its scientific evaluation followed for the formation of basic competences of formative research in the 
first years of university training in engineering careers.

Abstract  
This paper proposes to produce a hybrid of best practices in the field of Information and Communications 
Technologies (ICT). The aim is to empower the user to use a combination of multiple ICT best practices concurrently, 
leveraging off the strengths of some best practices to support the weakness of others. This goal would help 
organisations to solve the challenges faced when they need to get multiple standards of ICT best practices 
simultaneously, resulting in an enhanced integrated process. This paper focuses on the Service Level Agreement 
(SLA) process, following a “Best of Breed” approach on the four integrated best practices.  
The main contribution of our research is the enhanced process, which has taken into consideration a combination 
of multiple ICT best practices. By following the steps and using the proposed systematic way for building the new 
integrated process, the organizations will be able to follow the multiple best practices and pass the standard audit. As 
a baseline, four best practices have been selected to apply this study, namely Information Technology Infrastructure 
Library (ITIL) V4 , Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) V2, Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) 
V18.5, and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) 2019 .

1. Introduction  
Nowadays, most organizations are convinced of the value in implementing process improvement standards and best 
practices. This is due to the high expectation on service quality to gain customer satisfaction and improve the business 
orientation. Business environments are increasingly driven to increase higher quality value to the stakeholders, 
improve customer loyalty and retention, corporate governance, market share and profit and to reduce overall costs. 
All these demands put increased pressure on organizations to become more and more effective. An efficient way of 
achieving this is better exploitation of ICT systems. This is a worldwide trend prompted by increasing interest and 
demands for greater levels of governance, audit, and control.

Abstract  
 
This paper aims to analyze the relationship between dynamic marketing capabilities, service excellence, and hotel 
satisfaction in the hotel industry from the customer's perspective. This study is built from conceptual framework 
relevant to each other with the dynamic capability approach and service design logic. Data was gathered from online 
survey through G-Forms where respondents need to answer the questionnaire based on their experience and 
perspective. The data were collected from 357 customers who stayed in the hotel before and during the pandemic 
Covid-19. The analysis data Structural Equation Modeling using Smart-PLS 3.3.2 version. The outer model consists 
of a validity and reliability test, while the inner model examines R-square, T-statistics, and P-value tests. Further, 
structural equation modeling was performed to test the construct relations in this study's theoretical framework. The 
model tested using the inner and outer model and predictive relevance. Result show that dynamic marketing 
capabilities, service excellence, and satisfaction of the brand are all supported. The study provides information and 
suggestions for the further marketer, not only in the hotel industry, for what can be done to work on the market that 
is always changing effectively.

1. Introduction 
Tourism itself is a source of foreign exchange for Indonesia, with Indonesia being an archipelagic country, where 
Indonesia has a lot of natural wealth, making many foreign tourists interested in visiting Indonesia. If the tourism of 
a country is very developed, it can improve the country's economy, where the income generated by consumption 
tourist goods and services, taxes that are imposed on businesses in industry tourism and opportunities for 
employment and open employment opportunities for the community to support the tourism industry activities (Sari

2548","equal to 340 or ten times the total indicators that have been made, but in this research, the researcher has collected a 
total of 357 respondents. The first analysis is analysis of convergent validity and discriminant validity. In the three 
round of running the actual test, there are thirteen indicators that are not valid because the value still below 0.70, 
which are, DMC 1, DMC 2, DMC 6, DMC 8, SE 1, SE 4, SE 5, SE 6, SE 7, SE8, SE 9, SE 11, SE 13, hence those 
indicators were eliminated to get an accurate result for the model and structural measurements, starting by dropping 
the smallest number in each construct and re-run the PLS-Algorithm, until all numbers become valid. The validity 
test is done repeatedly to prove the results to be valid indicators. Furthermore, the reliability test examined that all 
the variables and indicators are reliable. Basically, in the actual data processing process, the researcher divides it 
into three types of data processing, the first is the PLS-Algorithm (as previously mentioned), then there is also in the 
PLS-Algorithm, such as checking construct and reliability in a study, which in this study stated that all were reliable. 
Then, there is an explanation of HTMT, in which HTMT is a new way to assess discriminant validity, which in this 
study to state a valid indicator is that all values must be green or cannot be above 0.90 or equal to 0.90.  
 
Limitations and Recommendation for Future Research  
There are several limitations of this research as follows, the results from the data collected are based on the honesty 
of respondents and based on their own experiences during their stay in 3-star until 5-star hotels in Indonesia. For the 
next research, it is recommended to find more respondents regardless of the ten times standard and wider 
geographical location and may use the longitudinal research to get the result more accurate because different 
geographical will contain different characteristics and the longer time might help to analyze more deeply as well. 
Last, this research can be implemented in other industries besides hospitality. For example, banking, securities, 
airlines, or public services, and hospital.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The first hypothesis is dynamic marketing capability has a positive and significant effect on service excellence of the 
hotel is verified with 5.093 which the T-statistics is higher than the T-value of 1.96. Supported by the thoughts when 
as time goes by, there would be changes in some parts, including in the service world. Organizations can perform a 
good service if they know what the market wants or needs which always changes during certain times. The second 
hypothesis is dynamic marketing capability has a positive and significant effect on the satisfaction of the brand 
(hotel) is verified where the number shows the number 3.589 that implies T-statistics is higher than the T-value 1.96. 
The last hypothesis is service excellence has a positive and significant effect on the satisfaction of the brand (hotel) 
is verified with the number 6.482 that implies the T-statistics is higher than the T-value of 1.96.

Abstract  
 
According to the Brazilian Federation of Banks-Febraban, in 2019, 39.4 billion bank transactions were 
carried out using smartphones, representing 48% of the total. From January to April 2020 (during the 
COVID-19 pandemic), mobile banking transactions were 22%, making customers who were not used to 
this channel to be forced to perform the migration. Customers who made the optional migration to the 
mobile banking system already reported problems related to their user experience. With the complete 
switching of customers to the online format, banks' challenge in offering a satisfactory experience to the 
user will be even more significant. This challenge is mainly demonstrated by the profile of users who had 
not yet migrated to the mobile banking system. They are characterized by some kind of aversion to the use 
of technology, whether due to a lack of knowledge in operationalized, security, or tradition of performing 
face-to-face service, among others. The National Confederation of Shopkeepers -CNDL found in its survey 
that 49.7% of the elderly interviewed have a smartphone but do not use any application, and, among those 
who use it, only 11% do it for bank transactions. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the impact of the 
user experience through resistance to use and the moderating effect of age on the acceptance of mobile 
banking applications. The user experience involves all the user's perceptions when using a product. On the 
other hand, age appears as one of the main factors of resistance to the use of mobile banking, being, 
therefore, an important variable to be measured, given the current discussions regarding ageism, prejudice 
against age. For this, exploratory research with a quantitative approach was carried out, using structural 
equations via variance. The study had 7 variables: BT - Traditional Barrier, BI - Image Barrier, BU - Use 
Barrier, BV - Value Barrier, BR - Risk Barrier, MBR - Resistance to mobile banking and age (biological 
age and cognitive age), which appears as a moderating variable. In total, 156 replies were obtained, all of 
which had been used. The results revealed that the user experience explains the adoption of mobile banking 
by 74.1%. Among the factors that most influence resistance to this adoption are the Barrier of Tradition 
(32.47%) and the Barrier of Risk (23.62%) (p-values <0.001). Such barriers are related to the attachment

2560",,"that some users have to the traditional way of dealing with their bank pending issues - in addition to the 
risk they consider in migrating to a virtual platform that can generate uncertainty for the operation. 
Therefore, banks should dedicate part of their investments in mobile banking to actions that mitigate these 
barriers. Regarding the impact of age (cognitive and biological) on the acceptance of mobile banking, it 
was not possible to prove, in this research, significant moderation in the user experience and adoption of 
mobile banking. Thus, it is suggested that age is not a moderating/impacting factor, and users of all ages 
may present barriers to use.

Abstract  
 
The increase in mobile phones and the increase in access to the Internet has led to the emergence of new 
channels of interaction between companies and their customers, such as applications. One of the sectors 
that most adhered to the use of applications was food. According to a survey conducted by the Brazilian 
Association of Bars and Restaurants -ABRASEL, the food delivery market moved to R $ 11 billion in 
Brazil in 2018. According to a survey by Mobills, in 2020, spending on the main delivery applications for 
food (Rappi, Ifood, and Eats Uber) grew 103% in the first half of 2020. One of the factors that propitiated 
this growth was the SARs-Cov2 pandemic that, due to most countries' social isolation measures, caused the 
search for digital media as one of the few safe options for continuing this business relationship, ensuring 
business survival and convenience and protection of users. Thus, because of the increase in the number of 
consumers and the entry of new competitors in the sector over the years, it is essential to analyze the 
variables that affect the success of food delivery applications in Brazil in times of pandemic so that 
companies optimize their efforts and improve the customer experience. This study's general objective was 
to investigate the factors that influence the intention to use food delivery applications in Brazil and suggest 
improvement initiatives according to the study's most impacting variables. An exploratory quantitative 
study using structural equations was carried out. The study was an adaptation of the model by Venkatesh 
et al. (2012), previously employed in accepting the mobile Internet. The structural model presented in the 
survey obtained 245 responses and was validated with a rho_A = 0.815 and Fc = 0.875, explaining the 
intention to use food delivery applications in 48.1%. The results revealed that the most impacting factors 
in the intention to use are the expectation of performance (14.90%), confidence (10.27%), hedonic 
motivation (7.78%), and price (6.09%). Thus, it is suggested that the companies adopt measures and actions

2563",,"to expand the user experience, ensuring a better expectation of performance and hedonic motivation and 
the adoption of actions to validate user requests in two or more security systems, ensuring trust. Thus, it is 
possible to create strategies via gamification, increasing the hedonic motivation, presenting possibilities of 
progressive discounts with each evolution of the user. In comparison with previous studies before the 
pandemic, it can be observed that factors such as habit, the expectation of attempt, and hedonic motivation 
appeared with a greater level of influence. In the context of the pandemic, factors such as performance 
expectations, confidence, hedonic motivation, and price have become more influential, with a change in the 
user's profile. In this way, it is noticed that the new user is more concerned with better performance for him, 
in the confidence of the application, as well as in the financial relationships that occur through the 
implementation and the price. The hedonic motivation is repeating itself.

Abstract 
 
The use of e-learning in universities has been widely used and proven to be effective in supporting student 
learning activities. The scope of the e-learning feature differs from one university to another depending on the needs 
of the university concerned. In some universities e-learning is used in all learning activities from the beginning of 
study to final semester examination assessments and even thesis examinations, outdoor practice exam assessments 
also use the e-learning system because the e-learning used will combine all student learning outcomes including 
results. thesis examination. The problem is found when the thesis examiner lecturer must immediately enter the results 
of the thesis examination at that time after the thesis test is complete or the lecturer must enter the examination results 
in the field. In the web-based e-learning system, lecturers have difficulty because web-based e-learning has low 
mobility in its use, especially during the conditions mentioned above. The purpose of this research is to help lecturers 
or instructors enter the test results right away using mobile technology. The result of this research is e-learning that 
combines web-based systems and mobile-based systems or hybrid models

1. Introduction  
E-Learning can be used at almost educational levels from elementary to tertiary education because the 
learning process can be created more effectively and efficiently. E-learning is also used in non-formal institutions such 
as communities and education for career advancement which is part of knowledge sharing in companies, The 
difference in education level is one of the factors that distinguishes the features used in e-learning because the need 
for knowledge and learning processes is different at each level of education. 
Higher education is the highest level of formal education where the knowledge transfer process is not only 
limited to theoretical knowledge but a lot of practical knowledge that the learning process and assessment of learning 
outcomes must be carried out outside the room when it also requires high mobility requires mobile learning. Thus, 
web site-based e-learning combined with mobile learning becomes a solution for education in higher education 
The purpose of this research is to help higher education combine website-based e-learning which is used in 
statistical learning activities and mobile learning which is used for learning activities with high mobility. The result 
of this research is a hybrid e-learning mode for higher education

Abstract  
 
In this study, researchers focused on research on border diplomacy by the Indonesian side of Malaysia to accelerate 
the construction of the International Goods Terminal at the border of Entikong, Sanggau Regency, West 
Kalimantan, which the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation built to regulate and facilitate the flow of foreign 
goods in the border region. The approach used by researchers in this study uses a qualitative approach, the location 
chosen as the research location is adjusted to the area where the International Goods Terminal was built, namely in 
the Entikong Subdistrict, Sanggau District, considering that in this very strategic border region international 
economic activities are often carried out but governance and progress in the area are still lagging when compared to 
neighboring Malaysia. In determining the researcher's informant using a purposive technique, the informants in this 
study were Sanggau District Head, Entikong District Head, Sanggau Cross-border Post Head, and the Malaysian 
Consulate. The results of this study found that in the process of accelerating the construction of the International 
Goods Terminal to expedite international economic flows by increasing clear customs related to the export-import of 
goods through dry port lines or so-called International Goods Terminals this was done through border diplomacy by 
the Indonesian side through the Malindo Social Institution. Public policy on cooperation between Sosek Malindo 
and governments in diplomacy related to affirming the legal status of the construction of the International Goods 
Terminal is carried out to control the obstacles that arise in the effort to accelerate it.

1. Introduction 
 
Border Cross Agreement and Between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government 
of Malaysia on Border Crossing Agreement are efforts to advance and manage border governance. Both contain the 
determination of national boundaries and the right for each country with different sovereignty to have one rule with 
a common goal set together. This is part of diplomacy to reach an agreement on the rules governing border areas. 
 
Diplomacy at the border is related to international relations' scope, including production processes and 
products (Sharp, Melissen, Duncombe, & Holmes, 2019). Attention to diplomacy activities in the border region 
focuses on structuring the part. The area which is on the border between countries in its arrangement will always be

6. Conclusion 
 
The Indonesian government's program related to the policy of developing Dry or Land Ports called 
International goods terminals is the right policy associated with the conditions in the Entikong border region itself 
indeed requires a container for carrying out export and import trade transactions to Malaysia by the laws and 
regulations in force in Indonesia. The construction of the International Goods Terminal is also the Indonesian 
government's response to the backwardness of the West Kalimantan border region, especially Entikong, compared to 
the border region in Malaysia to improve the people's economy by facilitating access to international trade, which 
directly also reduces the level of cross-border crime related to illegal trade and increases business opportunities and 
work for the community so that it does not necessarily only work in the agricultural sector by relying on private land 
alone. Still, the city can expand creativity in work and knowledge with the International Goods Terminal 
construction. 
 
The effort to accelerate the construction of the International Goods Terminal in Entikong Subdistrict, 
Sanggau Regency, was carried out because of obstacles, namely the creation of an International Goods Terminal 
which was deemed not to have a robust legal umbrella-making local investors hesitate to become developers of the 
International Goods Terminal project. Based on the results of the research, it is known that there are two stages in 
realizing the legal umbrella for the sosek malindo law to accelerate the construction of the international goods 
terminal in entikong, namely first through the diplomacy towards Malaysia to agree on the lane's opening and 
second, namely through sosek malindo and the local government would continue the results of the discussion. 
 
Besides, the construction was carried out because of limited access to open cargo traffic lanes in Indonesia 
and Malaysia. Cooperation between Sosek Malindo and local governments in diplomacy related to affirming the 
International Goods Terminal construction's legal status was then carried out to control these obstacles. The 
obstacles that arise are also addressed through rules governing the International Goods Terminal's management and 
functions and those related to efforts that can accelerate development, such as land expansion or road opening. 
Diplomacy must also be carried out on Malaysia to open a cargo lane to Malaysia that can be done through the 
Malindo Indonesian Socio-Economic relationship to Malaysia so that it can hold further discussions on discussions

Abstract 
 
As a result of urban population growth, the number of vehicles and the demand for transport also increases in cities, 
causing traffic and parking problems, what requires smart management solutions. In this sense, the objective of this 
study was to qualitatively assess the effects of implementing a management system for regulated rotating parking. 
Based on the DeLone and McLean (D&M) Information Systems Success Model, two questionnaires and an interview 
script were elaborated, and applied to the Traffic Department of the municipality of Pato Branco - PR, and to the 
system developer. The interview was recorded, transcribed, and subsequently applied to thematic analysis in the light 
of the seven dimensions defined by the D&M IS Success Model: information quality, system quality, service quality, 
intention to use, use of the system, user satisfaction and net benefits. Qualitative information was coded according to 
each dimension, in order to identify specific topics relevant to the research. The main results showed that there was 
an improvement in agility in the parking process for drivers, expansion of payment options, and the remote 
management of the parking space use was enabled. For traffic managers, the possibility of issuing reports was 
expanded, as well as real-time information management, and the inspection of vehicle regularity became easier. The 
research points out the need for future studies to verify the vision of other stakeholders, and the global impacts of the 
use of these systems in urban mobility.

Abstract 
 
Motorized tricycles are local form of auto rickshaw in the Philippines. These are a common means of public transport 
in the country that transport in small towns and cities, especially in the rural areas. Motorized tricycles are built in a 
variety of styles, which differ from city to city, and are usually made locally by building a sidecar and affixing it to a 
motorcycle. Passenger tricycles can accommodate from four passengers to as many as six excluding the driver. 
However, the passengers of tricycles are commonly subjected to awkward postures and uncomfortable environment 
that can cause discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders. According to Philippine Statistics Authority, there are 
4,488,507 registered motorized tricycles in the country. 853,075 of these are operating in National Capital Region. 
The increasing number of tricycles are brought about by increasing volume of commuters in the country. This also 
translated into higher number of passenger complaints on their experience of discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders 
when riding the tricycle. Given these conditions, the paper aims to assess the current design of motorized tricycle in 
the country, identify factors that affect the discomfort level of passengers in riding the tricycle and come up with an 
ergonomic design of motorized tricycle that would be a standard blueprint in the Philippines. Although passenger 
comfort is a crucial indicator of service quality, existing studies tend to focus only on the design of cabin or vehicle 
body that takes into account the postural condition of passengers. Therefore, the researchers have conducted review 
of related literature, direct observation, surveys, interview, and use of ergonomic assessment tools in order to examine 
factually and accurately the passengers’ discomfort level based on numerous factors such as postural condition, 
environmental condition, road condition and health condition of passengers.  Statistical analyses such as correlation, 
stepwise regression technique, and residual analysis were performed in order to determine the factors affecting the 
discomfort level of passengers. Finally, quality function deployment matrix was used to determine customer 
requirements that will be considered in the ergonomic design of motorized tricycle. Key findings in the study revealed 
that factors that affect the discomfort level of passengers in riding the tricycle are the following: sitting height, hip 
height, hip breadth, buttock-popliteal length, popliteal height, noise level, heat index, vibration level, and travel 
duration. The authors were able to come up with an ergonomic design of motorized tricycle that considered all the 
factors the appeared significant in the study. The researchers applied the principles of anthropometry in the design in 
order to match the critical dimensions of the tricycle to the body dimensions of passengers.

1. Introduction  
Commuting in the Philippines is very much a part of the Filipino lifestyle. Riding motorized tricycles is a common 
mean of passenger transport everywhere in the Philippines. They transport in small towns and cities especially in the 
rural areas. Motorized tricycles are built in a variety of styles, which differ from city to city, and are usually made 
locally by building a sidecar and affixing it to a motorcycle. Passenger tricycles can accommodate from four 
passengers to as many as six excluding the driver. Due to its small size, structure and capability to drop passengers 
off a specific point, it is one of the most preferred vehicle of passengers (Dorado, Fabros and Rupisan, 2015). 
According to Philippine Statistics Authority, there are 4,488,507 registered motorized tricycles in the country. 853, 
075 of these are operating in National Capital Region. The increasing number of tricycles are brought about by 
increasing volume of commuters in the country. Unfortunately, the increased volume of commuters has also translated

2584","1255 hz of vibration level when riding the motorized tricycle. Exposure to vibration may cause psychological and 
physical effect on passengers and may cause discomfort and injuries. The vibration are caused by improper engine 
mounting to the chassis, poor chassis design, inappropriate use of tire type, lack of seat cushion and other 
environmental factors. Therefore, the authors proposed to LTFRB to conduct regular inspection on the maintenance 
of engine and chassis of motorized tricycle. Similarly, strict implementation on the appropriate use of tire type for 
tricycles are also encouraged. Providing cushion on cabin seats are also proposed to support the lumbar spine of 
passengers. The effectiveness of the seat cushion was qualitatively validated in reducing whole body vibration and 
musculoskeletal disorders of passengers (Makhsous et al., 2005).  
 
Marul and Karabulut (2012) made a study about the vibration effects of cushions used on tractor driving seat. In their 
research, three different cushions on driver’s seat have been used: wool, sponge and cotton. Pad accelerator receiver 
is put on seat to record vibration data. It was proven in the study that vibration rate varies on material property of 
cushion. In three cushions used in the research, wool is the best isolation material because it is more elastic and has 
energy-absorbing properties. It was verified to decrease vibration intensity of vehicle seat and improve comfortability 
of riders. Therefore, the authors proposed the use of wool cushion in the cabin seat of motorized tricycle with cushion 
thickness of 1.5 to 2 inches thick to support the buttocks, lumbar area and back of the passengers.  
 
4.4. Providing Heat Insulation for Motorized Vehicle  
Heat index is also a factor that affects the comfortability of passengers based on the result of statistical analysis. Heat 
index is defined as the human discomfort index that gives apparent temperature of what human perceive or feel as the 
temperature affecting their body. It is the temperature which people feel, which is different from the actual temperature 
of the environment they are in. Based on the data gathered by the reserachers, majority of the passengers are exposed 
to heat index of 36-45 degrees Celsius. Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Service Administration 
(PAGASA) considered the heat index “extreme caution” when the temperature reaches 32 to 41 degrees Celsius. Our 
body may possibly experience cramps and exhaustion due to heat. People might also experience dizziness, feelings of 
confusion and loss of consciousness when cramps and exhaustion persist.  
 
Passengers comfort on temperature is assured by factors that depend on the heat exchange between the human body 
and the ambient environment. As many passengers spend several minutes in tricycles, it is important to provide good 
thermal environment, which gives comfort and optimizes performance for both drivers and passengers.  
 
One of the commonly used heat reduction method for vehicles is automotive thermal insulation. Currently, there are 
many types of heat insulators in the market. One of them is the conventional heatshield. It works by deflecting heat 
away from the affected area. Such shields are usually made of fiberglass, mineral wool, cellulose, stryofoam, 
polyurethane foam and polystyrene. The materials differ in terms of cost, conductivity, installation, flammability and 
environmental impact. In the Philippines, styrofoam remains one of the most popular thermal insulation since it is the 
cheapest compared to other types of materials. It is also lightweight, reusable and versatile. Thus, the author propose 
the use of styrofoam material for heat insulation for the tricycle cabin. It is more readily available in the market, hence, 
styrofoam insulators are more affordable. Moreover, the lightweight properties of styrofoam insulators makes it an 
ideal candidate for tricycle use.  
 
5. Conclusion 
From the result of the analysis in the data obtained from 300 respondents of the study, the following conclusions were 
drawn: 
(1) Using Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorder (CMDQ) questionnaire, it was determined that the passengers 
experienced pain and discomfort during their ride in motorized tricycle. The most affected body parts of 
passengers in terms of discomfort when riding the tricycle are: hip/buttocks, lower back, thigh, neck and 
upper back. This is due to the sedentary posture of passengers when riding and unsuitable cabin dimension 
of existing tricycle design. It was also validated through Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) that the 
sitting posture of passengers using current design of tricycle pose moderate risk for musculoskeletal disorders 
and must be investigated and changed soon. 
(2) All major factors and sub-factors considered in the study were statistically treated using statistical analysis. 
Based on the results, sub-factors that have positive correlation to the discomfort level of passengers are sitting 
height, hip height, hip breadth, buttock-popliteal depth, popliteal height, noise level, heat index, vibration 
level, travel duration, speed, weather, traffic, age and BMI, which explains that as the values of these factors

2593","increase, the level of discomfort of passengers also increase. On the other hand, time of day sub-factors has 
negative correlation to the discomfort level of passengers, which explains otherwise. 
(3) The sub-factors were further analyzed and treated using stepwise regression analysis to determine the true 
predictors for discomfort level of passengers and the following factors were identified: sitting height, hip 
height, hip breadth, buttock popliteal length, popliteal height, noise, heat index, vibration level and travel 
duration. The identified factors will serve as the basis for the researchers in developing a new design of 
motorized tricycle. 
(4) For the ergonomic evaluation of current design of tricycle, it was also concluded that seat height and roof 
height of the tricycles are too low and are not matched with the sitting height and popliteal height of the 
majority of the passengers. These mismatch caused discomfort for the passengers especially during 
embarking and disembarking phase and may lead to back pain and neck pain. Similarly, seat depth, seat width 
and leg clearance of tricycle are too narrow especially if the capacity of the inside cabin of tricycle is for 
three passengers. It was also observed that dimensions are not matched with the elbow-elbow breadth and 
buttock popliteal depth of the majority of the passengers. These mismatched caused awkward posture for the 
passengers. These also explains that majority of the passengers are experiencing pain in their hips/buttock, 
lower back and thigh in riding the tricycle.  
(5) The authors were able to come up with an ergonomic design of motorized tricycle that considered all the 
factors that appeared significant in the discomfort level of passengers. The researchers applied the principles 
of anthropometry in the design in order to match the critical dimensions of the tricycle to the body dimensions 
of passengers. In addition, the authors also proposed to implement noise emission and vibration reduction 
regulations in order to minimize the discomfort level of passengers when riding motorized tricycle. Similarly, 
the authors also proposed the use of thermal insulators for the tricycle cabin in order to provide good thermal 
environment for the passengers.

Abstract 
Daycare is considered as one of the places where children construct their characters and abilities and strengthen them. 
It is a nursery for the supervision of children between the ages of 2-6 years while parents are at work. Since daycare 
centers are considered as second home for children, it is very important to provide a relaxed and safe environment for 
both teachers and children. Physical preschool environment plays a critical role on children’s cognitive, social, 
physical and emotional development, it affects children’s comfort, health and long-term well-being. Further, 
children’s physical environments may adversely affect their postures and postural risk. Research reveals that many 
school children sit in workstations that do not suit them properly. Schoolchildren who sit for long periods in 
uncomfortable postures may develop musculoskeletal symptoms that deteriorate with time. Yet common assumptions 
about what is ergonomically proper for adults may not be appropriate for children. Considering this situation, this 
paper aims to assess the ergonomic risk factors of the physical environment of daycare centers that affects the 
musculoskeletal discomfort of children and teachers. To address this, the researchers conducted surveys on the 
discomfort scores of children and teachers using the Corlett and Bishop body map questionnaire. Corlett and Bishop’s 
(1976) body part discomfort scale is a subjective symptom survey tool that evaluates the respondent’s direct 
experience of discomfort at different body parts. A total of 150 respondents were involved in the study comprised of 
100 children and 50 teachers. After which, classroom facility design of daycare centers was assessed by obtaining the 
actual measurements of ergonomic risk factors such as light, noise and temperature level as well as actual 
measurements of workstations and layout. Then, statistical tools were applied to evaluate the relationship of the 
ergonomic risk factors to the discomfort level of occupants. Analysis of variance was used to know the significant 
difference in the discomfort level between children and teachers as well as significant difference between the 
measurements of ergonomic risk factors among the 5 daycare centers involved in the study. Then to further analyze 
the true significant factors contributing to discomfort scores of occupants, correlation analysis was employed.

1. Introduction 
Education for children involves providing from both kindergartens to higher academic education. Early childhood 
education is the key to building a solid foundation for educational success for a child (Adams, 2008). Building a strong 
relationship between families and teachers will enhance children's growth, enhance parental skills and self-esteem 
and, in some cases, lead to community building (Martin, 2001). As children begin to meet people outside their families, 
they need individuals who are mature, well-educated, well-trained, and highly qualified in their understanding and 
knowledge of child development, so that children can learn, develop, enjoy and make a contribution effectively (Bruce, 
2012). 
 
Daycare includes treatment given to young children aged from one (1) to six (6) years old, either in their very own 
household, in the home of a parent or other caregiver, or a center-based facility. There are three (3) common types of 
daycare; first is the center-based care, second is the in-home care, and lastly, the care provided by a relative, a neighbor,

2596","For the work environment, factors that have significant contribution to the discomfort of both teachers and students 
are illumination, noise and temperature. 
 
For layout design, factors that have significant contribution for teachers are chalkboard width, chalkboard length and 
room length while for students are chalkboard width, chalkboard length and chalkboard height. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results of the study from 150 respondents have revealed that occupants in daycare centers have experienced 
musculoskeletal discomfort when using the current workstation and facility of daycare centers. Using the Corlett and 
Bishop body map questionnaire, the highest prevalence of body discomfort for students are buttocks, lower back, 
upper arms and upper back while for the teachers, highest body discomfort are found on lower back, mid back, thighs, 
upper arms and shoulder. Results from analysis of variance have proved that discomfort scores of teachers 
(mean=29.45, std.dev=2.19) are significantly higher than discomfort scores of students (mean=24.1, std.dev=1.86) 
having p value < 0.001. Results of two-way anova also showed that there is significant difference in discomfort scores 
of teachers and students based on body part. For shoulders, mid back, lower back and thigh, it was proved that 
discomfort scores of teachers are significantly higher (p < 0.001) that of students, while for buttocks, discomfort scores 
of students are significantly higher (p < 0.001) than teachers.  
 
The measurements of ergonomic risk factors considered in the study were also gathered from the selected daycare 
centers located in Bulacan. Measurements of workstation dimension, layout dimensions and work environment were 
obtained in order to determine their relationship to the discomfort scores of occupants. Using correlation analysis, it 
was proved that temperature level (r=0.732, p=0.012), seat width (r=-0.619, p=0.016) and table height (r=0.674, 
p=0.021) have strong positive correlation to the discomfort scores of students while seat height (r=-0.884, p=0.001) 
has strong negative correlation to discomfort score. On the other hand, results of correlation on teachers’ discomfort 
revealed that illumination (r=0.694, p=0.018), chalkboard height (r=0.737, p=0.011) and table height (r=0.774, 
p=0.009) have strong positive correlation to the discomfort scores, while seat height (r=-0.792, p=0.011) has strong 
negative correlation. 
 
We can infer from the analysis that the current design of seat is too low for the students that is why they experience 
discomfort in their buttocks, lower back and upper back. Similarly, the chalkboard height and table height are too high 
for teachers that is why they experience discomfort on their upper arms and shoulders while seat height is too low for 
teachers that is why they experience discomfort in their lower back, mid back and thighs.

Abstract  
  
This paper aims to develop a predictive model on the severity of injuries and musculoskeletal disorders encountered 
by kitchen workers in the Philippines. Previous studies have proved that workers in the kitchen area are exposed to 
musculoskeletal disorders and injuries due to several factors such as poor facility design, exposure to awkward work 
posture, poor work environment and other tasks-related factors (Gumasing and Espejo, 2020). Review of related 
literature states that improper design of physical environment such as ventilation, lighting and noise can cause 
discomfort, annoyance and dissatisfaction (Niu, et al., 2011), and improper design of workstation wherein repetitive 
work activities are performed lead to muscle fatigue and stress (Sripaiboonkij & Taptakarnporn, 2014). Hence, the 
researchers aim to assess the current condition of the kitchen areas in the restaurant industry in the Philippines in order 
to determine the risk and exposure of the workers to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) and injuries in terms of 
environmental factors and task-related factors. Key findings from the study revealed that workers in the kitchen area 
experience pain and discomfort in the lower back, thigh, shoulder, upper arm, and lower leg. In addition, result of 
rapid entire body assessment (REBA) proved that risk for upper limb disorders are common in kitchen workers due 
to their poor working posture and repetitive tasks like cooking, preparing food and cleaning of dining tables. Similarly, 
NIOSH lifting equation proved that workers are exposed to risk of MSD and injuries due to heavy lifting of kitchen 
equipment and food plates and utensils. Risk factors identified in the study were further treated and analyzed using 
regression analysis. The result revealed that factors such as work posture, lifting posture, temperature and working 
space significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to MSD; while risk factors such as kitchen layout, 
production rate, working space, floor type and lighting level significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to 
injuries. Given these conditions, the researchers recommend to redesign the facilities and workstation for kitchen 
restaurant.

I. Introduction  
A kitchen layout usually includes a plurality of work areas and devices arranged to promote efficient cooking and 
handling. The kitchen includes a food cooking area for cooking food items which require further processing and 
assembly into a finished product. Kitchen workers are important part of a restaurant and food service establishments 
for they are responsible for the quality of the food being served to the customers. However, kitchen workers such as 
cooks, waiters and staff are exposed to hazards perform manual tasks covering a wide range of activities, some of 
which can be hazardous to their safety. Kitchen hazards include slippery and uneven floors, dangerous equipment, 
heavy lifting, crowded workspaces, burns and food safety (Meason, 2019). Hazardous manual tasks can also represent 
risks to the health and safety of workers, with approximately half of the serious injuries to kitchen workers arising 
from muscular stress and repetitive movement (www.sa.gov.au). Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) include injuries 
such as sprains, strains of muscles, ligaments, tendons and joints. MSDs most commonly occur from gradual wear and 
tear to the body. The parts of the body most commonly affected by working in kitchens include the shoulder, back and 
wrist.

2607","The researchers also found that the current physical environment design of restaurant kitchen affects the severity of 
MSD and injury of workers such as poor illumination, poor temperature level and poor working space. To address 
these issues, the researchers recommend to redesign the illumination level and ventilation level of kitchen by installing 
additional lighting fixtures and exhaust fans in the area. It was observed that the average illumination level in the 
kitchen is only 80.2 lux which is below the recommended illumination level for kitchen areas of 160-500 based on 
OSHA. It was also observed that the current temperature level in the kitchen areas is 47.7 °C which is beyond the ideal 
comfort zone of workers of 19 C to 26 C. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The findings of the study have proven that workers in restaurant kitchens are exposed to risks of musculoskeletal 
disorders and injuries.  Based on the result of CMDQ, majority of the respondent experience pain in their lower back, 
shoulders, upper arm and neck. The risk was evident on the scores generated by REBA and NIOSH computed from 
their body postures while performing tasks. Several risk factors were considered in the study based on review of related 
literature, direct observation and interview from the people involved in the tasks. The result revealed that factors that 
affect the severity of injuries and MSD of workers are due to due to awkward working posture, poor lifting posture, 
poor flooring material, poor illumination level and ventilation level. Given these conditions, the authors suggest to use 
trolley in bussing the dishes in the kitchen and dining area, use of non-slip shoes for the workers, use of appropriate 
cleaning agents and compounds for kitchen materials, and installation of additional lighting fixtures and exhaust 
system in the area.

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 outbreak came suddenly and shocked all humans who live on earth because the rate of spread 
was so fast and resulted in high mortality and an extremely bad economic impact. The economic impact is very big, 
especially for the poor. Therefore, to protect the poor and vulnerable from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
government of Indonesia has designed several social protection security programs. One of them is the Village Fund 
Direct Cash Assistance or “BLT” (Bantuan Langsung Tunai -Dana Desa), which is financial assistance sourced from 
the Village Fund and is aimed at poor and vulnerable people who have difficulty fulfilling their daily needs, especially 
due to the COVID-19 outbreak. So far, the process of selecting people who receive assistance has been done manually 
by considering several criteria that must be met by these community members. Because the feasibility assessment 
process is carried out manually, the process is less effective and less efficient. Thus, this research aims to assist the 
assessment process to determine assistance for the poor by using a decision support system so that the process can be 
carried out more efficiently and effectively. . The result of the research is a DSS model for determining direct cash 
transfers for the poor.

1. Introduction  
The rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, which became a worldwide pandemic in a matter of weeks, has 
been attributed to the hypermobility of our current lifestyle, globalization, and the connectivity and accessibility of 
Wuhan, the first epicenter Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly evolved into a situation with profound effects 
on lifestyle and travel worldwide, ranging from a dramatic decrease in air travel to an unprecedented increase in 
teleworking. These impacts resulted from governmental measures (e.g., travel restrictions and shutdowns of whole 
sectors in the economy) as well as individual choices to refrain from traveling in order to reduce exposure to other 
people and the risk of contamination (Turban, 1998). The Indonesian government states that the Corona virus Disease 
2019 (COVID-19) has been declared by WHO as a global pandemic and in Indonesia is declared a type of disease that 
causes public health emergencies as well as non-natural disasters, which not only cause death but also cause 
considerable economic losses, The economic impact of this pandemic has had a dramatic effect on the well-being of 
many families and communities. For vulnerable families, loss of income will result in increased poverty, children who 
will receive less nutrition, and reduced access to health for things other than COVID-19. With cases confirmed in 
many low and middle income countries, this pandemic will have an impact on the poor who are most vulnerable to its 
impact.  
By observing these conditions, the government provides cash assistance to the poor who have met several 
determined criteria in order to help their economic needs. This assistance is given periodically to the poor   The

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is an agricultural country that relies on the country's economy, one of which is through the 
agricultural sector. However, farmers in Medium and Small-Scale Agriculture are the ones who are most 
disadvantaged when the harvest arrives. The problem is that when the harvest arrives, the yields are abundant while 
demand is stable, sometimes even decreasing because farmers do not have direct access to markets or buyers who will 
buy their crops. This research aims to build mobile commerce for farmers to make it easier for farmers to sell their 
crops directly through customer. The result of this research is mobile commerce model for farmers in Medium and 
Small-Scale Agriculture to sell their crops.

1. Introduction  
Agriculture in Indonesia is one of the key sectors of the Indonesian economy. Although the contribution of 
the agricultural sector to national gross domestic product has decreased significantly in the last half century, currently 
the agricultural sector still provides income for the majority of Indonesian households. Agriculture in Indonesia is lead 
with middle and small-scales agriculture (Quince ,2015) since furthermost of the agrarians in Indonesia have been 
agriculture independently in traditional techniques (Maat,2016). It is threatening for Indonesia to chance local food 
requirements. It is recognized that till 2018 Indonesia stagnant imports farming goods from other nations 
(Hisyam,2017). Growing the populace in Indonesia makes the requirement for food surges. In order to meet food 
needs, the evolution of the agricultural sector is needed. Problems found Based on observations in several Medium 
and Small-Scale Agriculture, it is difficult for them to sell their crops at a fair price due to their limited ability to sell 
their products. On the other hand, farmers have a community or cooperative that can be used as an institution to help 
their sales by using information technology. The aim of this research is to help farmers sell their crops using 
information technology through community or farmer cooperatives with mobile commerce. The result of this research 
is mobile commerce model for farmers to sell their crops

1. Introduction  
The Pandemic Corona Virus disease19 (COVID 19) caused many significant changes in our life activities 
and one of the major impacts faced in the teaching and learning process. Covid-19 Pandemic cannot be used as an 
excuse to stop teaching and learning activities but because of the Large- Scale Social Limitation or lockdown the 
implementation of teaching and learning activities faces great challenges because the process must be carried out by 
the Distance Learning method. Distance learning is a total conversion from direct face-to-face learning to electronic 
learning. The conversion process is also done suddenly without any preparation because this outbreak suddenly 
stopped almost all physical activity of humans. If the conversion process is carried out with careful preparation will 
produce better progress but because the conversion process is not done with good preparation there will be many 
obstacles encountered. There are so many obstacles faced and among the obstacles faced in Distance Learning are the 
constraints of information technology facilities or infrastructure and the knowledge of students or students and their 
companions. 
Based on preliminary observations that have been made from distance learning of elementary school students, 
students find difficulties if they do not understand the material or teaching materials and assignments given by the 
teacher. On the other hand there are student companions at home such as parents, brothers, siblings or others of

Abstract 
 
The need to optimize the use of all types of resources is a necessity in educational institutions as well as in any other 
type of institution. Preparing a course program is a very difficult task considering the resources. Usually, it is a 
waste of time and energy since it is made by traditional methods and by hand. There are some restrictions that must 
be followed when preparing the course program. In this study, a binary integer programming model is proposed by 
placing the timetable, lessons on the appropriate day and time periods and taking into account various constraints. 
The data are taken from Ibn-i Sina Vocational and Technical Anatolian High School in Nizip district of Gaziantep, 
Turkey. In the case study, there are 43 lesson hours and 15 classes to be given weekly for high-school level. In the 
model, it is aimed to assign the number of lessons per week to the days in the most balanced way. The aim of the 
model is to minimize the number of empty lessons during the day in any classroom in high school timetables during 
the pandemic period. In the proposed model comparing to the current timetable, the first sessions of the lessons with 
more than one session are assigned to the first days of the week, and the last sessions to the last days of the week. 
Thus, students are provided with a more flexible education in the last days of the week under pandemic conditions. 
Finally, break time is taken into consideration.

1. Introduction 
Scheduling problems are an important approach that should be used in almost every sector today (Köçken et al. 
2014). Aircraft departure times, shift schedules of nurses or doctors, shift schedules in factories, course schedules, or 
exam schedules in educational institutions may be some examples of scheduling problems. In this study, the 
education time scheduling problem, one of the aforementioned time scheduling types, has been discussed. The 
education time scheduling problem deals with the assignment of courses belonging to teacher and student groups to 
classrooms of appropriate capacity at appropriate time intervals in educational institutions and aims to make the best 
assignments in accordance with the resources, needs, and expectations of the relevant institution (Al-Yakoob and 
Sherali, 2006). Although there have been a lot of approaches applied in time tabling literature (Taş et al. 2018), 0-1 
integer mathematical modeling is used and it is aimed to assign the courses to the appropriate days and time period 
in this study.  
 
The scheduling problem is a problem encountered in educational institutions in every academic year. While 
preparing the scheduling, the classes to which the courses will be assigned according to their current situation, the 
restrictions on the teachers, and the scheduling according to the course time complicate the situation. Due to this 
complex structure, it is very difficult to find the optimal solution (Altunay and Eren, 2017b). In this study, the 
scheduling of a vocational high school in the Nizip district of Gaziantep is discussed. While preparing the timetable, 
a timetable is created considering 28 teachers, 15 classes, and 4 student groups. The distribution of the course hours 
has been balanced in the proposed approach. The problem is modeled using 0-1 integer programming and solved 
with the LINGO 14.0 optimization program. After the introduction section, the literature review is given in the 
second part, the mathematical model is explained in the third part, the data are explained in the fourth part, and the 
results are given and discussed in the fifth and sixth parts.

6. Conclusion 
The lesson scheduling problem is a difficult optimization problem that is frequently encountered in the literature and 
tried to be solved by using various methods. Although there are many studies on course scheduling in the literature, 
the problem has common constraints and objectives, as well as the constraints and objectives of the relevant 
institution. For this reason, the encountered lesson scheduling problem should be well analyzed and modeled. In the 
study, the problem is handled step by step and a solution is tried to be obtained with a mathematical approach. Many 
timetables have been prepared under pandemic conditions, and since there is confusion, an appropriate model has 
been presented considering the first and the last ones. When the constraint of sequencing is added, it is seen that the 
suitable solution is not obtained because the size of the model is too large, and it is tried to be made simpler and 
more understandable. In addition, developing a web-based decision support system can be a subject for future 
research.

Coal Terminal Location Determination 
Abstract 
PT. The X facility will change the coal distribution system with the addition of a supplier and a 
power plant. This is because mixing coal in each PLTU can cause disruption due to supply errors. 
The coal terminal functions as a means of blending coal. Coal blending is the mixing of two or 
more coal qualities to produce new coal qualities. The existing coal terminal will make the coal 
arriving at the PLTU ready for use and according to the coal calorie needs of the PLTU. Alternative 
coal terminal facilities are located at 19 PLTU. This research discusses the modeling of coal 
terminal location determination. The location determination is carried out using a linear 
programming optimization approach to obtain a location with the aim of minimizing coal logistics 
costs and investment costs. This study considers two shipping methods, namely direct delivery and 
transshipment, coal quality, expansion demand, and time. The selected coal terminal is Cilacap, 
serving PLTU Cilacap, Cilacap EXP and Pelabuhan Ratu. The construction of a coal terminal was 
carried out in the first year and required a cost of IDR 459,145,572,029,289.  
Keywords 
linear programming, coal terminal, location determination 
1. Introduction
PT. X seeks to make an additional facility that functions as a blending plant or coal terminal located between 
the supplier and the PLTU (PLN, 2019). This has been stated in the RUPTL which aims to guarantee the supply and 
quality as well as greater utilization of coal. The construction of the facility will change the coal distribution system 
at the PLTU. The initial distribution system using a direct delivery system changed to supplier delivery - coal terminal 
- PLTU. The shipment from the coal terminal to the PLTU is a shipment in accordance with the needs of the PLTU
so that it is expected to improve the smooth operation of the plant. An alternative location for the facility has been
determined, namely in the Java and Kalimantan PLTUs. According to Wilkey and Macal (1976), the development of
a centralized blending facility can be profitable because it can reduce blending costs, reduce bulk purchase costs and
reduce transportation costs. The production process at each PLTU requires coal quality according to the engine design
and generating capacity. This can be seen from Table 1.1. The most commonly used indicator of coal quality is the
calorific value. The quality of coal that is in accordance with the design of the plant will result in high efficiency.
PLTU tends to choose quality coal to get more electricity (Yucekaya, 2013). However, using high quality coal will
increase the cost of coal at the PLTU (Whyatt, J.D. and Metcalfe, S.E, 2004).Coal needs for PLTU in Java Island are
supplied by coal suppliers spread across the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. A coal supplier generally owns several

suppliers used in this problem, 19 PLTUs and 8 types of coal calories. The function of the coal terminal development 
is coal blending. With this development, the coal that has been received by the PLTU does not need coal blending 
because the incoming coal is in accordance with the needs of the PLTU. This model takes into account the direct 
distribution and also through the coal terminal. 
The results of the running model can be seen in the Table 2. The model used is a type of integer linear 
programming (ILP). However, in reality this model can be referred to as mixed integer linear programming (MILP). 
This is because the writer relaxes the variables 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑎
𝑡, 𝑥𝑗𝑘𝑎
𝑡, 𝑥𝑖𝑘
𝑡 without having to be an integer. This relaxation will
cause the running time of the optimization program to be faster. Variabel 𝐹𝑗
𝑡is a binary variable so it is classified as
an integer. This type of problem solving is branch and bound because it uses integer linear programming. The resulting 
status is global optimal which indicates that the result of this running is the best result that can be done and there is no 
better result. The number of variables used is 61,606 variables, there are 3,632 constraints used, and this problem 
running takes 8 minutes. This is a relatively fast time considering the number of variables and constraints used.

The results of running the software show that there is a coal terminal construction located in Cilacap and 
Cilacap EXP in 2020. However, we can conclude that there is 1 coal terminal to be built, namely in the Cilacap PLTU 
area. This is because Cilacap and Cilacap EXP are located in the same area but have different calorie requirements. 
The calories required for the Cilacap PLTU are 5200 and the Cilacap EXP PLTU is 4500. The Cilacap Coal Terminal 
will supply the PLTU in Cilacap and PLTU Pelabuhan Ratu. PLTU Pelabuhan Ratu has a requirement of 4400 calories 
totaling 3,700,000 tons / year. The PLTU Pelabuhan Ratu will be supplied entirely through the Cilacap coal terminal. 
The Cilacap coal terminal will produce 3 kinds of calories, namely 5200, 4500 and 4400 calories which will handle 3 
PLTUs.  
The choice of coal terminal location at PLTU Cilacap is influenced by the location of the PLTU which is in 
the northern part of Java Island. The northern part of Java Island is the farthest distance from suppliers, namely 
Kalimantan Island and Sumatra Island. This has resulted in high transportation costs from the supplier to the PLTU. 
Meanwhile, the locations of PLTU Cilacap and PLTU Pelabuhan Ratu are close together, resulting in low 
transportation costs from coal terminal to Ratu Harbor. Even though there are differences in the types of calories 
needed, the three PLTUs namely Cilacap, Cilacap EXP and Pelabuhan Ratu have similarities, namely the suppliers 
used. The three PLTUs use HE suppliers located in South Sumatra with 4400 calorie types. PLTU Cilacap and Cilacap 
Exp are also supplied from the same supplier, namely TME which is located in South Sumatra. The location of the 
supplier and the power plant can be said to be close together. Although the supplier is closer to the Pelabuhan Ratu 
PLTU, the demand for coal in the Cilacap area is greater, so the coal terminal location is located in the Cilacap area. 
6. Conclusion
The model developed in this study can be used to determine the location, allocation of coal shipments, coal blending 
in a 9-year time horizon. The number of selected coal terminals is one, namely the Cilacap coal terminal with a total 
cost of Rp 459,145,572,029,289 for 9 years. There are 3 PLTUs served by the Cilacap coal terminal, namely PLTU 
Cilacap, PLTU Cilacap EXP and Pelabuhan Ratu. The construction time of the Coal Terminal is in the first year. This 
research is strategic in nature, only considering the number, location and capacity of the coal terminal. If this research 
is to be developed into operational, it requires further study, namely simulation. This is because this research has not 
considered uncertainties such as the need for ship frequencies, and the length of time for ship transportation.

Abstract 
 
In Indonesia, the air conditioning market has barely grown in the last decade. This stagnant market will result in tough 
competition for air conditioning companies. Some companies begin to realize service offering is able to increase their 
profit through integrating goods and services to satisfy customer's needs and enhance customer’s productivity. This 
business model called servitization will change the point-of-view of distributors from product-centered to service-
centered. Servitization business model in Indonesia's air conditioning market is not new, but not widely implemented 
and some implementation is not successful. There are still a few numbers of studies regarding ventilation and air 
conditioning business model in Indonesia. It is important to recognize the elements of successful servitization 
implementation and their impact on successful implementation. This paper aims to identify and evaluate the critical 
success factors of ventilation and air conditioning servitization in Indonesia and how those factors will help the 
stakeholders. Through literature reviews, interviews with experts, and surveys, the author will determine a set of 
candidate success factors. Then, the DEMATEL method is used to identify and rank the critical success factors. This 
research will contribute to the understanding of the servitization business model in Indonesia and encourage the 
innovation towards servitization model.

1. Introduction 
In the modern era of competitive Air Conditioning market, where demand is stagnant and the market volume stays the 
same, companies are struggling to maintain their position in the market. Indonesia air conditioning market grew around 
1% yearly for residential products and -1,8% for commercial products. This growth is far lower than Indonesia's GDP 
growth, which is around 5% yearly. This situation is presented in table 1 and table 2 from JRAIA (2019).

Some limitations still exist within this research. We use data from experts in Indonesia, but data from other countries 
or other industries should be a good comparison to this research. The current research is based on expert panels with 
a limited number of experts. For future research, it will be a good improvement to address more stakeholders. We will 
use another method for weighting in future research as DEMATEL's foremost function is to explore relationship 
between criteria.

Abstract 
 
I propose a method that can efficiently apply artificial intelligence technology to integrated security control 
technology. In other words, it detects cyber attacks and responds appropriately by applying machine learning learning 
to artificial intelligence based on the big data collected by the integrated security control system. The artificial 
intelligence-based integrated security service model that analyzes and responds to these behaviors gradually evolves 
and matures through effective learning methods. In addition, through the proposed security service model, future 
research directions for security management that can efficiently support the analysis and response of security personnel 
are presented.

possible when infringement/failure occurs, and work continuity and efficiency are increased. 
 
1. How to collect artificial intelligence data  
In order to generate learning data and predictive data, it is necessary to collect original logs and history data 
from the integrated security control system. As a process of converting the original log into a form that is 
easy for machine learning, it is necessary to extract feature values based on analyst know-how. To this end, 
information on the capacity of learning and detection data for each collection system should be secured in 
advance, and issues should be collected in advance when collecting detection data and learning data. 
 
2. Development plan of artificial intelligence integrated security control service model 
  For an integrated security control system to which artificial intelligence is applied, it is necessary to prepare 
a system that predicts, prevents, detects, responds, and evolves itself from a security system that analyzes and 
responds to after detection. It is necessary to develop a normal-based learning model to strengthen the ability to 
respond to threats that are not identified as abnormal behaviors. In addition, when applying various techniques 
to improve the accuracy and performance of the model of the artificial intelligence learning system, the optimal 
training data is selected through a feature selection algorithm for the training data, weight is assigned to each 
field, and an optimized model is selected through a sampling technique. Should be applied. 
 
 
3. Conclusion 
Data is more important than anything else in integrated security control using artificial intelligence, and such data 
should be applied to external security issues as well as internal data. In this study, there may be limitations to the 
method of formalizing various log data. Therefore, research on standard information sharing system for 
standardization and sharing system should be continued so that external information sharing system can be used in 
various integrated security control services in a formal data format.

Abstract 
 
It is to investigate the effect of artificial intelligence-based customer recommendation service on purchases through 
brand loyalty in online shopping malls, and to determine if this is ultimately related to consumer purchases. The 
purpose of this study is to understand the types of customer recommendation services based on artificial intelligence 
and to investigate the effect of purchasing on brand awareness and causality. 
Artificial intelligence-based referral service served customers. As can be seen from the high probability, the artificial 
intelligence-based recommendation service has a great influence on the brand's parametric attitude. 
The results of this study are as follows. 
First, the customer recommendation service based on artificial intelligence will have a positive effect on the brand. 
Online consumers are having a positive influence on brands by receiving recommendations with experiences of 
interest based on their information. 
Second, it can be seen that having a positive brand for a product has a positive effect on purchasing. 
Customers who experienced a recommendation service based on big data in an online shopping mall found that 
customer service using artificial intelligence has a positive effect on the brand and positive influence on purchase 
through brand enhancement.

Abstract 
 
 Artificial intelligence is human learning ability, reasoning ability, perceptual ability, and other artificially 
implemented computer programs or computer systems including the same. Recently, as interest in artificial 
intelligence increases, research related to artificial intelligence is increasing. In the field of architecture, research 
related to the development of architectural technology using artificial intelligence is increasing too. This Research is 
understanding deep learning by visualizing deep learning data using architectural data, and through this research, a 
program was created to visualize the results by using real estate data among architectural data and predicting apartment 
sales prices. In order to predict the apartment sale price, independent variables were derived using reference to 
previous studies, web crawling technique, and variable selection method. The deep learning learning was conducted 
using linear regression analysis using the apartment sales price using the residential area, and the predicted value was 
extracted using the learned deep learning model. Using a deep learning learning model, the predicted data can be 
checked by inputting an arbitrary residential area value, and the resulting data is visualized on a map.

Abstract  
 
We examine students’ learning engagement and satisfaction in using technology by analyzing how learning 
engagement influences online satisfaction such as through communication and usability, the teaching process, and the 
instructional content. This research focuses on a mixture of SDT and TAM. We propose a structural model that 
explains students’ learning engagement and online satisfaction with specific dimensions. The empirical test was a 
model with quantitative data from 52 universities in Indonesia involving 1002 students using SMART PLS version 3. 
Our research found that learning engagement has a significant influence towards online satisfaction with a big 
determinant value. In particular, the digital learning engagement has three strong interlinked elements: behavioral, 
emotional, and cognitive engagement. Other variables are online satisfaction which is a strong element for the teaching 
process and instructional content but lower for communication and usability. These findings have several important 
implications for learning engagement research and practice.

1. Introduction  
 
There are learning challenges in seeing the fact that the education world is changing during a crisis due to COVID-
19. Until April 1, 2020, UNESCO recorded that at least 1.5 billion school-age children were affected by COVID-19 
In countries, including 60 million in Indonesia. The Ministry of Education and Culture of Indonesia responded by 
doing physical distancing to minimize the spread of COVID-19 with a policy of learning from home through online 
learning. The implementation of learning from home, with the use of information technology that has been applied 
suddenly, often shocks educators and students, including parents in the house. However, the online learning that took

2674","student and student satisfaction from learning online is better than the face-to-face method. This finding is in line with 
previous technology acceptance research (Xiao et al., 2020), (Nortvig, et al., 2018), (Kangas et al., 2018), (Han et al., 
2020). Students are satisfied because the overall instructional content from both the performance of the lecturers and 
content meet their learning expectations. This finding supports previous acceptance research (So & Brush, 2008), (Lin 
et al., 2018). Students will interact and evaluate as a repurchase action of satisfaction. They find two ways of 
interacting according to an online time course, and according to the results of experience from this course they would 
like to take another online course in the future. This finding is in line with previous technology acceptance research 
(Xiao et al., 2020), (Nortvig, et al., 2018). 
 
  
5.4 Validation  
 
The involvement of digital learning can indirectly evaluate the impact of online satisfaction on technology 
acceptance-based educational platforms (Table 3). First, digital learning engagement leads to communication and 
usability through online satisfaction. Online satisfaction as pleasure using educational media is mediated by digital 
learning engagement and communication usability. When communication and usability support SDT's basic 
psychological needs, students are more engaged and satisfied (Lan and Hew, 2020), (Nortvig, et al., 2018), (Bockmier-
Sommers et al., 2017). Communication and usability were significantly associated with digital learning engagement, 
but their contribution was lower than other satisfaction dimensions, namely the teaching process, instructional content, 
and repurchase. The low level of digital learning involved with communication and usability proves the problem of 
the limited competence of teachers or lecturers in the use of critical learning applications (Web, 2020). The low 
technology competence can be an opportunity for more practice through digital teaching to increase content 
knowledge, share information, and communicate with students using digital platform device skills. Previous research 
supports this research (Topala and Tomozii, 2014). 
Second, online satisfaction can mediate digital learning engagement leads to instructional content. It means that 
online satisfaction using an education platform mediated using digital learning engagement instructional content. 
When instructional content supports the SDT basic psychological need, students are more engaged and satisfied (Lan 
and Hew, 2020) (Nortvig, et al., 2018), (Bockmier-Sommers et al., 2017). However, the instructional content was 
significantly related to digital learning engagement with a high contribution, which shows the number of the 
determination value (R2). A high level of digital learning engages one to the instructional content. This finding aligns 
with previous SDT research (Hair et al., 2017), (Earl, 2019). This finding implies that the content and online material 
delivered by the lecturer should develop to be involved with the style of the young generation. It eliminates the 
boredom of students in an online class. The previous research supports this suggestion research (Hair et al., 2017), 
(Earl, 2019). 
Third, digital learning engagement leads to repurchase (interactions and evaluations), online satisfaction mediate 
that variable. It means that digital learning engagement mediated online satisfaction using an education platform to 
interactions and evaluations (repurchase). When the teaching process supports the SDT's basic psychological needs, 
students are more engaged and satisfied (Lan and Hew, 2020), (Nortvig, et al., 2018), (Bockmier-Sommers et al., 
2017). However, student acceptance of interacting and evaluating (repurchasing) was significantly related to digital 
learning engagement with a high contribution. It shows the number of the determination value (R2). A high level of 
digital learning engaged with interacting and evaluating (repurchasing). This finding is in line with previous SDT 
research (Earl, 2019). According to the second goal of this research in which teacher-student-parent relations in online 
learning are not integral yet (Web, 2020), it is not proven. It may be that the scope of the education problem is too 
general, and this research only samples students in higher education who have a mature age, wisdom, and 
responsibility. This finding implies that higher education can engage with this young generation by being active in 
online interactions using a mobile application for managing the course, assignments, discussions, and administration. 
Previous research supports this suggestion (Nikou et al., 2017). 
Fourth, online satisfaction mediated digital learning engagement leads to teaching processing. It means that the 
digital learning engagement instructional content can intervene online satisfaction using an education platform.  When 
the teaching process supports the SDT basic psychological need, students are more engaged and satisfied (Lan and 
Hew, 2020), (Nortvig, et al., 2018), (Bockmier-Sommers et al., 2017). In the teaching process, a high level of digital 
learning engages the teaching process. This finding aligns with previous SDT research (Hair et al., 2017), (Earl, 2019). 
The implication of this finding is in the lens of SDT and TAM. The quality of the competence skills of the online 
lecturers, content, system, and two-way interactions should be updated and developed because the millennial 
generation has a disruption in learning. This situation can affect higher education in the present and the future. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Overall, our results align with previous basic research that integrates self-determination into technology 
acceptance, confirming a relationship between engagement and technology acceptance. Also, our proposed model 
ensures TAM in the context of online satisfaction using an education platform. The study’s main contribution is the 
proposed integrated model of SDT and TAM to explain and predict students’ satisfaction to use an education 
technology platform. However, more research found towards the direction of exploring engagement and the

junior, and senior high school samples, need to be employed. A deeper understanding of the factors driving 
engagement and satisfaction based on technology acceptance will help education stakeholders to design better the 
assessments used for education platform devices. Taking into consideration both acceptance and engagement factors, 
more engaging can be designed and implemented.

Abstract 
Using E-Commerce in online buying and selling of products is very convenient since there is no need for physical 
interaction, and it is also cost efficient for both buyers and sellers. This platform had increased its utilization during 
the time of pandemic as people prefer to stay home and do transactions virtually. This led the authors to conceptualize 
a design of an E-commerce system for veterinary healthcare providers and pet owners as the pet care industry is 
growing. The portal will let the healthcare providers promote their products and services, including the schedules of 
their clinics. The pet owners or service subscribers, on the other hand, may use the portal to view those veterinary 
clinics and make transactions like creating an appointment or product purchases. The authors gathered data through 
survey questionnaires to determine the user requirements and the needs of developing the system.  The results of the 
survey were also used to identify the functionalities of the E-commerce portal such as booking of appointments, live 
chat, service monitoring, and payment. These functionalities included the wireframes which represent the prototype 
design of the E-commerce portal.

1. Introduction  
In the Philippines, the population of Domesticated animals, mainly dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and 
hamsters, range from 1 to 4 four per household (Tan 2015). Additionally, in 2017, a specific statistic available for the 
Dogs population states, 11,600,000 dogs are in the Philippines. One form of taking care of pets is bringing them to an 
Animal Clinic that provides services such as check-ups, grooming, surgery for animals, and products. 
Due to the pandemic brought about by COVID-19, where social distancing must be practiced and they need 
to follow other the safety protocol, it has affected acquisitions and transactions towards pet clinics and pet owners.

2683","Figure 11 shows the fifth set of 5 pages, the nineteenth page is the homepage of the VetConnect administrator, 
where admins check the number of customers who have been registered, receiving complaints, and monitoring the 
service status of the pet clinic and the order status. On the eighteenth page it shows the registered user page, that 
includes a list of customers that had been register to the web application, followed by the eighteenth page, the number 
of users gives complaints about the application, that shows the name birthdate and complains that you can open the 
messages of the user. On the twentieth page shows the name of the customer, ordered products and from what clinic 
that they ordered the item from. Lastly the twenty-first is the service page where you can overview the animal clinics, 
the customer names that the customers choose to service their pets, and they can see on what type of service that an 
animal clinic that they served the customer. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This research is created for both the pet clinic and the pet owners to assist them in their transaction regarding 
pets. Designing the website application will give a viable platform for pet owners and pet clinics to continually 
establish relationships in consideration of the pandemic, as well as to assist in enabling services present to animal 
clinics to be continued. The authors have considered assistive circumstances by preparing questionnaires to point out 
needs, circumstances, budgetary concerns, and assessment concerning the viability of how effective the website will 
be for its users.  
The design of the website application will also cater to what functions are needed in the design to help the 
authors focus on the website. Majority of the respondent’s results help us to create or innovate the design for both 
customers and the business owners, that will improve the business for the animal clinic and the easy-to-use website 
application. The research paper would prove beneficial to readers who would express interest in using the given 
application, assessing its functionality especially during times of pandemics in which courier-based and online 
deliveries have proven successful. The importance brought about by website application and deliveries provide a more 
automotive stance towards consumer behavior due to access and demand, in this case, for products and services 
offered. Pet owners will benefit greatly due to ease of acquisition, as well as clinics for assistance on orders, services 
offered, and availability. Opportunities can be brought about by linking in a more independent platform relatable to 
local settings due to its specific nature, in which assistive care as well as continuous use can be prominent for both 
animal clinics and business owners. 
Future research would be ideal for companies, clinics, and business owners; companies who would be willing 
to link up for budgeting and finding customers/partnerships, clinics who would be willing to integrate application 
systems, and business owners who would be willing to support and make use of application systems of a similar 
nature.

Abstract 
 
The intense governmental effort to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), allowed project development 
accomplishment within this framework and, hand in hand with globalization, has connected Colombian territories 
with large cities by technological interfaces. The population and territorial view of the SDG has promoted trends that 
bring near consumers and territories of goods producers or consumer services; one of these trends are short commercial 
systems (SCS). This research has proved that Colombian SCS aid commercial exchange equity, promote sustainable 
and conscious consumption, produce new social and commercial links, contribute to reducing packaging use and solid 
waste production, product freshness, traditions and knowledge exchange, supply chain actors autonomy and 
integration of actors involved; this was also potentialized by the Covid-19 sanitary crisis. Evidence showed that SCS 
is performed by families or farming associations that lack technics to certify quality process and that effectively apply 
continuous improvement process, making uncompetitive operations faced to other commercial models; however, 
traceability as a quality strategy for perishable products has shown to adapt, allowing continuous quality improvement 
according to the supply chain actor requirements and the appropriate architecture that allows to model according to 
the requirements of each of the participant actors. The need to build a technological architecture that allows 
establishing the best commercialization and distribution model for each actor involved in the supply chain, ensuring 
guidelines for development and success of this technological answer is concluded from the four phases of this research. 
The architecture involved in this research allows adaptability in different rural families in the same economical sector, 
potentializing competitiveness, and clear information flow, minimizing risks, time, and allowing decision making 
facing possible risks.

2695","5. Conclusions  
 
It is concluded that the proposal based on research of Short Commercial Circuits may obtain a technological advance 
that allows farmers to generate greater benefits from the products offered to the traditional market.  
The proposal offers an opportunity to points of sale or marketing channels to broaden the vision of their small 
businesses by making agreements with producers that derive a strategic alliance between the actors and promote 
economic and sustainable development. 
 
Traceability architecture proposal and its verification, complements actions between farmers and consumers, allowing 
to add value through detailed records for continuous processes improvement. The proposal also allows to locate new 
demands or improve decision-making relying on data and support information.  Based on results obtained, there is 
evidence of an opportunity and development of government or national programs beginning to contribute to 
sustainable development within the logistics and value chains in the agricultural sector.

Abstract 
 
Online retail business like Shopee, Zalora, and Lazada are established in a technological environment of mobile 
applications. Thus, all their components are heavily integrated with technology. However, there is one area that 
needs to be improved which is the after sales or the customer service. The project focuses on designing an 
enhanced automated chatbot for any e-commerce website. The idea revolves around the thought of having a 
smoother online shopping experience for both customers and sellers. The proposed automated chatbot shall 
also be the means to implement a data analytics dashboard for the website administrators to monitor, manipulate 
and visualize the occurring concerns and issues faced by customers. The chatbot shall lean towards the 
customers and user’s preferences on the designs, functionality, and product of the project. The researchers 
proposed the e-Commerce customer service chatbot to be named as Shop Buddy to appeal to the public. The 
overall project shall provide a better shopping experience for customers and user’s alike as e-Commerce is the 
present, and future of the business industry.

1. Introduction  
The modern world relies heavily on technology and its application. Different industries like logistics, 
education, health, retail, and so much more have already integrated technology. In the applications of 
technology in the business industry, innovation is almost always the initial process. Innovation plays a big role 
in business and technology and as technology provides a variety of opportunity to improve a business and its 
processes, the business can fully utilize the technical advantages brought upon by technology.  
e-Commerce platforms like Shopee, Zalora, and Lazada are some of the most common online retail 
mobile applications in the Philippines and users from all demo-graphs are familiar with their features and 
brands. Other types of e-Commerce platforms like Alibaba, AliExpress, Amazon and eBay are also on the rise 
which caters to different customers. All e-Commerce platforms feature components that are heavily integrated 
with technology. However, one such area of the e-Commerce that has been neglected: the customer service. 
Upon using the applications above, it is beyond noticeable that the customer service lacks automation and often 
serves as a liability for the online purchasing experience. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The researchers intend to follow the following objectives regarding the use of chatbots in customer service for 
e-commerce websites. 
• 
To design a chatbot that will be able to handle customer engagement while also able to present 
collected data from these interactions into useful data analytics.

view of the proposed system architecture. With this, it considers the functionality and application of the project. 
Like a use-case diagram, the systems architecture showcases how the potential user and customer could interact 
using the proposed system. In the Figure 3, features a more in depth look at the process flow of the proposed 
project. Within this, the researchers considered the design of the information systems of the project which was 
incorporated on how the project acts and is being utilized. Figures 4, 5 & 6 presents the actual idea or design 
of the focus of the project, which is the chatbot. This presents the different pre-determined outcomes and paths 
that the chatbot would consider when interacting with the user. It is also seen that the chatbot presents different 
options and specific options to the user to help narrow down the request.  
 
4. Conclusion  
Innovation is almost often the initial process for technology implementations in the business sector. 
In business and technology, innovation is critical, and since technology offers a range of opportunities to 
develop a business and its structures, the business can fully leverage the technological advantages offered by 
technology. All e-Commerce sites have components that are highly technologically incorporated. However, 
there is one aspect of e-Commerce that has been overlooked: customer service. It is more than evident when 
using the above applications that the customer service ignores precision and also acts as a vulnerability for the 
online shopping environment. With this, the researchers want to create a chatbot that can manage customer 
experience while also presenting information gathered from all of these interactions as valuable data analytics. 
One of the possibilities is the right of users to ask questions about their issues. Another choice is to 
use data analytics to decide which of the users' or customers' key issues and grievances should be handled by 
the company. Customer service is an important part of any company, but it is particularly important in the e-
Commerce industry. Since the e-Commerce sector is one of the many and has the most interactions with 
retailers and consumers, having a dependable customer support team is vital to the success of the company. 
In order to further strengthen their after-sales transactions with their clients, the project will 
concentrate on automating the customer service of the established website. The chatbot project of the project 
will allow to identify the issues and determine the key issue from the user or customer interaction in which a 
copy of the interaction and likely presentation of dashboards will then alert the host site that demonstrates the 
comparisons of the issue with other similar instances. Since data analytics is a component of the project's 
content, the overarching implementation should be planned with the intention of providing a customer service 
that incorporates data analytics among its primary purposes. 
The researchers will concentrate on one distinct area when developing the project: The Shop Buddy. 
This area would represent the essence of the project and would be the subject of the project's advantages and 
benefits. The Shop Buddy is the automated customer service chatbot connected with any E-commerce website. 
This chatbot is a predetermined chatbot that features questions and options that the customer can choose from 
to narrow down their concerns. And lastly, the data analytics features of the project shall be used by the users 
of the website and shall showcase the data analytics portion of the project.

Abstract 
 
Natural disasters that occur have an impact on the agricultural sector. The impact of the disaster on the 
agricultural community in the form of failed harvests and damage to farming facilities, in addition to 
causing considerable losses to the community it is also detrimental to the government because in the end it 
can have an impact on food shortages. The agricultural sector has an important role in West Muna Regency, 
a sustainable planning is needed and in accordance with the conditions in the region. Therefore, this study 
aims to analyze agropolitan area planning in the agricultural sector in West Muna Regency based on natural 
disaster mitigation. The data used in this research is agricultural sector data, especially food crops in West 
Muna Regency. The Location Quotient method is used to analyze efficient food crop base commodities. 
Based on the results of the study, it was found that an efficient food plant base commodity was obtained 
with geographic conditions as an Agropolitan Area. In addition, commodities that are suitable for the 
disaster that occurred in West Muna Regency were also obtained. Thus the availability of food raw materials 
is still available and maintained, and can increase competitiveness in the agricultural sector.

3592","Figure 9.Histogram of LQ Value of Sweet Potato Food Crop Production in West Muna Regency per District 
in 2018 
 
Based on Figure 9, the value of LQ> 1 for the production of sweet potato crops in West Muna Regency, namely 
the districts of Barangka, Wadaga, Central Tiworo, Tiworo Islands and Kusambi. Meanwhile, for other districts, the 
LQ value is below one. 
Based on data on production of basic commodities in West Muna Regency, including peanuts, corn, soybeans, 
cassava, and sweet potatoes. For regional peanut commodities that have an LQ value of more than 1 are in Wadaga 
District with the highest LQ value of 5.4, then Barangka District with an LQ 3.9 value and the three Lawa Districts 
with an LQ 3.3 value. Corn commodities that have an LQ value of more than 1 are in Barangka and Tiworo Tengah 
Districts, namely 1.1, Lawa and Tiworo Selatan Districts, 1.3, and Tiworo Utara Districts 1.5. Soybean commodities 
with an LQ value of more than 1 are in Barangka, Wadaga and South Tiworo Districts, namely 1.1, Maginti and 
Toworo Islands Districts 1.5 and Central Tiworo 1.6. The cassava commodity production quantities with an LQ value 
of more than one are in Maginti, Kusambi and napano Kusambi districts with 2.3, 2.5 and 2.1 respectively. 
Furthermore, sweet potato commodities with an LQ value of more than one are in Barangka District, namely 1.2, 
Wadaga 3.7, Tiworo Tengah 1.7, Tiworo Islands 3.3 and Kusambi 1.8 Districts. 
The results of the analysis based on harvested area and production data show that peanut is the most basic 
commodity because it has the highest LQ value compared to other commodities scattered in Lawa, Wadaga and 
Barangka Districts. This means that the peanuts produced by Wadaga District, Barangka District, and Lawa District 
are able to meet the needs of their regions and have the potential to meet the needs in other areas or in other sub-
districts in West Muna Regency and even export peanuts outside West Muna Regency. The sub-districts of Tiworo 
Selatan, Tiworo Kepulauan, Kusambi and Napano Kusambi, the LQ value is still very small so that it cannot be 
developed yet because it is not enough to fill the sub-districts. Sawerigadi, North Tiworo and Tiworo Tengah Districts 
do not produce peanuts. 
 
4. 
Conclusion 
Based on the existing conditions of the agropolitan area of West Muna Regency, the agricultural commodities 
of food crops that are widely cultivated in West Muna Regency are corn, peanuts and rice. The development of an 
agropolitan area based on the results of LQ analysis shows that the basic sector of food crops in West Muna Regency 
is based on data on the harvested area, namely maize in North Tiworo of 1.5, soybeans in Central Tiworo sub-district 
of 1.6, peanuts in Wadaga sub-district of 5.4, cassava in Kusambi sub-district of 2.5 and sweet potatoes in Wadaga 
sub-district of 3.7.

Abstract 
 
The small tanneries in Arequipa are traditional companies tending to disappear due to environmental and competition 
problems. In order to survive, they need to become more technical and apply models that allow production within the 
environmental standards required by government agencies and a better application of their resources to make their 
production profitable and be competent. The proposed management model applying Good Manufacturing Practices 
allows to systematize the control of processes and their continuous improvement, without representative costs that 
may be within the reach of a small tannery. With its implementation it will be possible to identify and reduce the waste 
of resources and the consumption of inputs. 
 
Keywords 
Tannery, production management model, good manufacturing practices, business project management. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Peru is a country with an important tradition in the animal skin tanning industry, there are important companies and 
brands of products based on natural leather that have international positioning, but this industry has not managed to 
develop technologically, because it is going through a of its worst crises; mainly due to external factors of the 
environment of the leather industry, such as high competitiveness, alternative products and environmental 
requirements. In this analysis there are also internal factors, which remain over time and do not allow the necessary 
changes for their development, for which it is necessary to intervene, so that they can subsist and develop. In Figure1 
you can see how the works are currently being developed, in a very traditional way. 
Micro and small companies in the tannery sector have been characterized by empiricism in the management of their 
operational processes and uncontrolled levels of environmental pollution, which in turn cause low productivity and a 
bad image. These companies have developed empirical processes over the years, in which measurements, records or 
tests are not carried out, this limits continuous improvement, makes it impossible for companies to analyze their 
processes and effectively measure their results. Figure 2 shows the transport of leather belonging to a small tannery, 
in an unconventional way.

2722","To evaluate the environmental impact, an analysis of the wastewater was carried out, to compare the values of the 
polluting elements before and after implementing Good Manufacturing Practices. In the measurements, the degree of 
acidity or basicity of the aqueous solution (pH), the thermal degree (Temperature), the portion of retained solids 
(Suspended solids), the concentration of sulfides (Sulfides), the amount of oxygen and the degree of residual load 
(BOD5) and degree of contamination (COD). 
Table N 4 details the results of the analysis carried out, where it is verified that the wastewater that comes out after 
applying the GMP processes contains fewer polluting elements, which reflects a better result in the environmental 
impact, which makes the product more competitive, especially in the international market

which will have better results if an information system for the dosage and impact of tanning inputs is implemented. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The planning, implementation and maintenance of the Good Manufacturing Practices system allows the processes to 
be aligned and to begin to reduce the inputs according to the results of skin quality control and environmental quality 
control. The implementation of the Production Management Model is very low cost and brings with it improvements 
in productivity and competitiveness of the company, giving it a place in the tannery market, strengthening itself against 
its external and internal clients. 
With this model, the standardization of processes can be achieved, which can be standardized in all small tanneries 
that seek the same product quality. The inclusion of a system of Good Manufacturing Practices aligns the company to 
an international quality system which can be certified. 
At present, small tanneries, in order to continue with their operations, must have environmental management 
instruments (IGA), where real and potential impacts are recorded; and improvement projects are proposed, which are 
required by the Ministry of the Environment through the OEFA and by the Ministry of Production through the 
Directorate of the Environment. This work proposes an information system for the dosage that will contribute in the 
support of your improvement projects.

Abstract  
 
In Chile, rural population faces long access times to specialized health services, as these tend to be concentrated in 
regional capitals. Against this background, the present study proposes the establishment of a Collaborative Health 
Resources Management Model, based on the practice of sharing hospital resources between medical centers, allowing 
daily transfers of doctors and medical equipment within a hospital network. The objective is to meet local demand 
and increase rural accessibility to healthcare, in terms of reducing patient transfers between hospitals and access times. 
To compare the current and proposed scenarios, an Integer Optimization Model with a Network Structure is 
formulated. The case study is focused on urology specialty in Zona del Reloncaví, a rural area located in southern 
Chile, on which it is concluded that allowing the mobility of hospital resources, specifically doctors and equipment, 
is optimal, as the average number of patient transfers and the average access time are reduced by 95.6% and 83%, 
respectively. By applying this model, hospitals are able to stretch their limited capital budgets by jointly purchasing 
equipment, providing network-wide access to resources needed for expanding healthcare accessibility.

1. Introduction  
 
Over the last years, disparities in the population's spatial access to health services have become a global issue, being 
even more challenging in developing countries, such as Chile (Van Doorslaer et al. 2007; Peters et al. 2008; Fábrega, 
2013). Vaccaro (2011) defines spatial accessibility to health care as the relative ease of health services to be utilized 
by the population, depending on the geographic structure over which they are distributed and the limitations it imposes.  
 
Compared to the urban population, the rural one often has poor access to health services, largely due to impediments 
to travel and availability of services (Marmot 2005). The challenge is exacerbated when considering that health 
services and population demand are hardly equally distributed (Luo et al. 2009). In fact, geographic disparities in 
access to health care exist within rural areas themselves, where lower accessibility is often associated with rural areas

2733","- It is recommended to get rid of the assumption that transfers of patients, doctors and medical equipment take a full 
day, and to incorporate vehicle routing as a mechanism to add more realism to the model. 
 
- It can be complemented by conducting a study from the point of view of cost reduction, i.e., from a hospital approach, 
to analyze the economic feasibility of implementing this concept in Chile. 
 
Regarding the experiments: 
 
- The modeling network may incorporate in the future the total number of hospitals in the Zona del Reloncaví, allowing 
a closer analysis to the reality of the sector, although it will increase the execution time of the code.  
 
- More specialties could be considered, along with different types of medical equipment for each one. 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
This paper reports the results obtained by analyzing the consequences of allowing transfers of doctors and medical 
equipment within a hospital network. It should be noted that the objectives of the study are met. On one side, it is 
concluded that the implementation of a CHRMM in the studied health network is feasible. Also, the performance of 
the proposal is measured, showing, mainly, that it brings benefits by increasing both the level of service offered by 
the hospitals involved and the spatial accessibility offered to patients, having a major implication in a significant 
reduction in patients’ transfers. Thus, the implementation of this CHRMM strategy would be positive for the 
inhabitants who are treated in the selected hospital network and could have a great impact on their daily lives.  
 
From the results, it is suggested the active participation of the Government of Chile when addressing the poor spatial 
accessibility to healthcare that mainly affects rural areas located far away from big cities. The latter could be tackled 
by injecting resources within the framework of the IHSN Program. By doing so, the resources invested by the Chilean 
Government would be oriented to the implementation of a new health system according to the new needs of the 21st 
century, based on a collaborative economy where transfers of doctors and medical equipment are allowed. 
 
Besides, it is concluded that it would be beneficial to further develop this scheme. Therefore, the next step would be 
to develop a prototype applicable to a network of hospitals in the country, in order to analyze, on-site, the benefits 
expected from this research. The authors recommend analyzing the results of the COVID-19 Vaccination Program in 
Chile, given that its implementation in regions has been based on the application of a resource management model 
similar to the one proposed. 
 
Finally, in the medium term, a public policy should be developed, linked to an IT program that would allow hospitals 
to request and offer their own medical equipment, to achieve a higher level of service and, above all, greater spatial 
accessibility, in terms of reducing socio-territorial inequalities in relation to health services.

Abstract 
 
The existence of synergies between several quality management systems and sustainability has spurred great interest 
in better understanding the sustainable quality management (SQM) concept over the past decade. This paper aims to 
design and develop a sustainable quality management framework (iSQMF) that integrates the quality management 
practices with the Whole System Design (WSD) practices, including the environmental, social, and economic 
sustainability aspects. The relevance of the designed iSQMF in supporting quality management research and 
sustainable initiatives is detailed and reported. In addition, the research presents a twelve-stage planning system as a 
tool for monitoring and controlling the implementation of SQM programs.  The proposed framework holds great 
potential in not only bringing sustainability concepts actionable but also addressing the institutional and developmental 
processes in a management system.

1. Introduction 
Since the early 1980s, a plethora of contributions has been observed in the field of quality (Pleban, 2013). These 
contributions were documented as standardization protocols and legal actions that perceived quality as a product and 
production-oriented concept. This included specific modus operandi, processes, distribution of authority, and 
resources for imposing quality management; rather than a system concept. The early 1990s after the earth summit 
showed a shift in this concept. The concept of  “quality” was replaced by a “quality management system (QMS)” that 
defines quality management as a system for managing and monitoring an entity with an allusion to quality (Podgórski 
et al., 2001). A wide range of management system has been created over these years, extending the focus on quality 
management theories and sustainability concepts such as environmental management systems (EMS), organizational 
sustainability (OS), and occupational health and safety (OHS) management system. These systems are often targeted 
in achieving organizational goals under the umbrella of an integrated management system.  
Several frameworks have been developed and presented over the past two decades focusing on quality management 
principles to attain prolonged and sustainable results. Most of these research works have addressed the quality 
management perspectives on specific domains such as big data science (Taleb et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2018), food 
and health care sectors (Pité, et al., 2017), nascent technologies (Kotian and Meshram, 2017; Pahl, 2017), 
entrepreneurial and industrial sector (Saad and Khamkham, 2018; Azarov, Mayboroda, & Leokhin, 2018). From the 
vast existing literature on quality management, a very few studies have attempted in integrating the quality 
management concept with environmental management (Molina-Azorin et al., 2009) and sustainable concepts 
(Martínez-Jurado and Moyano-Fuentes, 2014) or concepts of QMS (ISO: 9001) with EMS (ISO: 14001) (Heras‐
Saizarbitoria and Boiral, 2012). These fields are linked through specific management practices like using concepts of 
lean management, quality, sustainable management, and environmental systems. Coglianese, (1999) and Isaksson, 
(2004) highlight the growing importance of using EMS and QMS in stimulating sustainable development. Thus,

Abstract 
Currently, pollution and poor recycling are global issues. Recycling is a widely used waste-management 
method throughout the world and contributes to eliminating waste efficiently and reduces the excessive 
use of natural resources. In this study, an optimized collection system of household recyclable material 
has been characterized and designed for cities with a low recycling level. To address this task, we propose 
a mathematical programming model that integrates two decisions, allocation and routing of different 
varieties of recycled products. First, the distance traveled by each customer and the costs associated with 
installing smaller collection centers are minimized. Subsequently, to minimize recyclable material 
transport, a route planning problem is solved by collecting from centers of greater capacity rather than 
from small centers, according to the traveling salesman problem. To illustrate our approach's usefulness, a 
numerical example based on the case of Chile's southern city is considered. The results suggest that the 
developed model is a practical tool for decision-makers in making tactical and operational decisions to 
reduce recycling costs. 
Keywords: Recycling logistics, Supply Route optimization.  
1. Introduction 
Currently, pollution and poor recycling are global issues. Given the ease of communications and competition 
between companies, it has become essential to add value to proposed implementations to compete in the market. 
Despite the development and diffusion of new technologies occurring at accelerated rates, this is not reflected in the 
development of appropriate technologies or policies that manage all waste, especially electronic waste generated in 
developing countries. This issue causes problems in material handling and contamination as well as a greater 
environmental uncertainty regarding the “end” of many products (Tansel, 2017). Several authors consider recycling 
as part of the chain, that is, what takes place after the product is no longer used by the consumer, when it reaches the 
garbage and finally, a landfill, as a growing problem in current societies. Every day, more products are consumed 
and discarded at an accelerated rate (Johnsen et al., 2014). The global trend with respect to waste generation is 
shown in Table 1 and currently, the world is generating 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually. 
Worldwide, waste generated per person per day averages 0.74 kilograms varying from 0.11 to 4.54 kilograms. The 
amount of global waste is estimated to reach 3.40 billion tonnes by 2050 (Kaza et al., 2018). 
Recycling is based on obtaining raw material or products from a waste and it can be total or partial, depending 
on each case. From some materials, it is possible to obtain the raw material to be used differently, whereas others 
require directly generating a new product. An example of an already used good is a plastic bottle. This bottle can go 
to the garbage or be recycled and thus acquire a new life cycle. Therefore, recycling contributes to eliminating waste 
efficiently and reduces the excessive use of natural resources. This process of the reuse of products and materials is 
known as reverse logistics (Agrawal et al., 2015; Govindan and Soleimani, 2017). 
The most commonly recycled products are as follows: paper and cardboard, plastics in their multiple varieties 
and electric/electronic articles. Each of these wastes presents their own complexities of handling and treatment. 
Generally, recycling involves sorting operations that separate recoverable waste from the others and recycling plants 
where the wastes are finally recycled and/or stored (Edalatpour et al., 2018; Gold and Seuring, 2011; Heidari et al.,

Table 6 presents the results of the integrated model. We can observe that the integrated model obtains the same 
optimal solutions found by our proposed model. Therefore, our approach is not suboptimal, which is one major 
concern of decomposing the problem into two sequential subproblems. In addition, we can observe in Figure 3 that 
the integrated model has a substantial increase in computing times in the larger instances with respect to the 
integrated approach, such as in instance 4 that the separated model needs 237.39 secs and the integrated model 
requires 391.34. While in instance 5 there is much difference in the computing time to obtain the optimal solution 
and the separated model needs 93.36 secs the integrated model needs 1369.40 secs.

4. Conclusion 
Although pollution has multiple causes, there are many opportunities for improvement in the field of recycling, 
both individually and collectively. In this study, research was carried out with an approach aimed at the supply chain 
of recyclable material collection for cities with a low recycling level. Thus, it was possible to characterize an 
optimized system for collecting household recyclable material, specifically in the city of Concepción, Chile.  
The model allows visualizing the economic flow of the costs related to the inverse logistics process. This enables 
the management system to predict the costs of installing of initial recycling centers and the transport of recyclable 
material. Thus, the results suggest that the cost of installing an initial recycling center is a more important factor than

2767","the customer’s distance from one of those centers. Therefore, extra restrictions should be considered concerning the 
distance traveled by each customer. Besides, because the problem is decomposed in two sequential subproblems, 
frequently this approach provokes suboptimal solutions, and for this very reason, we demonstrated that our approach 
is not suboptimal and even showed it has better performance in the larger instances.  
Future works could cover the problem analyzed more precisely, such as a more detailed characterization of the 
recyclable material generated by the people, to prioritize space for larger recycling centers and proper conditions. 
Another possible research direction could focus on the fact that the population participates effectively, detects 
possible improvements, chooses the placement of recycling points, and researches other actions that motivate 
constant participation in recycling. This study is the starting point for future and more detailed analyses that can be 
applied to the community of Concepción and other cities with a low recycling level.

Abstract  
 
Deadlock control techniques for automated systems have been developed based on Petri nets. Some resources in these 
systems are unreliable or failing. Thus, the developed deadlock policies are not appropriate to these systems. Thus, 
this paper presents a strategy for solving deadlocks in systems with unreliable resources. The first step is to apply 
elementary siphon control method to design control places without considering resources failures. Second, all control 
places in the first step are merged into a global control place by using a colored Petri net. The third stage involves the 
design of a common recovery subnet based on colored Petri nets to handle all resource failures. Finally, the proposed 
strategy is evaluated using a manufacturing system from the literature. The results demonstrate that the suggested 
strategy is capable of handling all unreliable resources in the system, has a simpler structure, and has small 
computational overhead.

Introduction 
An automated manufacturing system (AMS) is a conglomeration of production and material handling resources. 
Multiple products enter the production system as discreet events and process them based on a specified sequences of 
operations. Because of their interaction and shared resources, deadlock states occur and the system is indefinitely 
blocked and cannot finish its task (Li et al. 2008, Li et al. 2012, Abdulaziz et al. 2015, Chen et al. 2015). Thus, there 
is a needed to develop an effective deadlock-control methods to prohibit the occurrence of deadlocks in the AMSs. 
Petri nets are powerful mathematical tools that can be used to model, evaluate and control deadlocks AMSs. In 
addition, it can be used to describe the characteristics and behaviour of the developed AMSs such as synchronization, 
sequences, conflict, boundedness and liveness (Chen et al. 2011). Many polices were developed based on a Petri net 
tool to avoid the issue of deadlock in AMSs. These polices are categorized into three strategies: deadlock avoidance, 
deadlock detection and recovery, and deadlock prevention (Wysk et al. 1991, Chen et al. 2011). To design controller 
for AMSs, Three criteria are developed namely, behavioral permissiveness, structural complexity, and computational 
complexity (Chen et al. 2011). Therefore, the aim of many researchers is to establish deadlock prevention strategies 
that can provide supervisors with the above mentioned requirements (Chen et al. 2011). The deadlock approaches 
were developed for AMSs with reliable and unreliable resources. For reliable resources, structural analysis (Chao 
2009, Chao 2011) and reachability graph analysis (Ghaffari et al. 2003, Uzam 2004, Uzam and Zhou 2004). Several

Conclusion 
 
Deadlock control techniques for automated systems have been developed based on Petri nets. Some resources are 
unreliable or failing.  Thus, the developed deadlock policies are not appropriate to these systems. Therefore, this paper 
proposes deadlock control technique for systems with shared unreliable and resources. The first step is to apply 
elementary siphon control method to design control places without considering resources failures. Second, all control 
places in the first step are merged into a global control place by using a colored Petri net. The third stage involves the 
design of a common recovery subnet based on colored Petri nets to handle all resource failures. Finally, the proposed 
strategy is evaluated using a manufacturing system from the literature. The results demonstrate that the suggested strategy 
is capable of handling all unreliable resources in the system, has a simpler structure, and has small computational 
overhead.

Abstract  
 
Increasingly sophisticated technology has a positive impact on their users. One of their positive effect was 
making internet users to shop online. Interest in online shopping is considered very high in Indonesia, it 
can be seen from the significant development of e-commerce in Indonesia every year. Therefore, 
researchers have interest in conducting this research to determine the basis of consumers in choosing 
Shopee as number one e-commerce in Indonesia, by reviewing the extent to which the relationship 
between brand trust, brand love, and brand respect can affected brand loyalty and brand equity. It is a new 
research, which makes this research more interesting to discussed. The results showed that two 
hypotheses are supported theoretically but not statistically significant, namely brand trust and brand 
loyalty. It can be concluded that consumers will be loyal to the marketplace when consumers have brand 
equity, have a sense of love, and respect for the marketplace. However, when consumers trust a 
marketplace, it is not certain that consumers will be loyal to the marketplace.

1. Introduction 
According (United States Census Bureau, 2020), Indonesia is listed as the fourth country with high population, 
namely 267,026,366 people. This is certainly has an impact on the increasingly advanced development of the 
internet. The development of internet users in Indonesia has grown since 2006 until now (Yudhi Lazuardi, 2017) and 
the largest number of internet users in Indonesia are in the city of Jakarta with 3,450,000 users (Yudhi Lazuardi, 
2017). Along with the increasingly rapid development of the internet, a lot of e-commerce was created or entered 
Indonesia. For this study, the authors chose Shopee, an e-commerce from Singapore because Shopee was in the first 
position with the number of users and visitors on its application. Interest in online shopping in Indonesia is 
considered quite large, therefore researchers have an interest in knowing the basis of consumers in choosing Shopee, 
by reviewing the extent to which the relationship between brand trust, brand love, brand respect has a relationship 
with brand loyalty and brand equity. Consumer trust is a major feature of the relationship between consumers and 
companies (Atulkar, 2020). Therefore, companies must be able to build and maintain consumer trust. ""Trust also 
refers to positive beliefs from consumers in the products or services offered"". With the established trust, it will result 
in a long-term relationship between consumers and the marketplace. In addition, in his research (Liu et al., 2012) 
said that brand loyalty has a relationship to the level of consumer interest, which is also called brand love. With 
consumer love for a marketplace, brand loyalty will automatically be created. This is supported by a research

and brand loyalty. In accordance with the limitation owned by the researcher that the researcher suggests to increase 
the number of respondents, because the more respondents the more accurate it will be. Researchers also hope that 
this research can be used as the basis for further research further research becomes based on research that has been 
tested and researched previously.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between product design aesthetics, product 
development process, attitude toward the brand, product evaluation, and product preference based on 
literature review and data analysis. This study's approach is quantitative research with a data collection 
method using the electronic questionnaires of Google forms. This study was conducted in Indonesia, so 
the Indonesian consumer becomes the respondents of this research. In this research, total data gathered 
from 250 respondents were analyzed by Smart PLS 3.2.2. These findings of this study indicate that 
product design aesthetics, product development process, and attitude toward the brand impact product 
evaluation. Moreover, product design aesthetics also impacts product preference. However, in this study, 
the attitude toward the brand towards product preference is not supported. Besides, the hypothesis 
between product evaluation and product preference is also not supported. This study's results provide 
significant theoretical and managerial implications for marketing strategy theory and R&D through 
product evaluation and product preferences for the factors included in this study and a deeper 
understanding of the smartphone industry marketing by describing it.

1. Introduction 
Technology cannot be denied from everyone's desire in this period of globalization because technology can help 
each individual's daily activities, such as smartphones. Smartphones have a working system like computers that can 
filter the system and gadget capabilities usually; smartphones also have a touch screen, can access the web, and a 
system that can run downloaded applications (Oxford University Press, 2016). In Indonesia, the information and 
telecommunication industry is one of the industrial sectors that has experienced significant progress because the 
demand for smartphones in Indonesia is relatively high. This high demand is seen through an increase in demand by 
17.1% in 2018 compared to the previous year (Ermalina, 2020). The high demand for smartphones in Indonesia 
makes competition between smartphone manufacturers increasingly competitive in making sales. Gartner, in the 
third quarter of 2017, there were five smartphone manufacturers with the highest sales, namely Samsung with 85.6 
million units, Apple with 45.4 million units, Huawei 36.5 million units, OPPO with 29.4 million units, and Xiaomi 
with 26.8 million units sales (Bohang, 2017). Even though Apple is one of the smartphone manufacturers that 
occupies the second level, there is still much demand for iPhones because it has its market share with users who like 
sensitively attractive smartphones (Barokah et al., 2019). The iPhone continues to improve and add to its features, as

Abstract 
 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR - Industry 4.0) is an emerging and revolutionary step transforming the overall 
manufacturing industry business model. Over the past decade, 4IR is witnessing increasing attention by both scholars 
and practitioners due to its ability to achieve high competitiveness growth and innovation. The adoption of 4IR 
technologies (I4T) can tremendously improve the operational performance of any industry and it can solve many 
difficulties linked to the production process, the provision of services, and the overall supply chain. In this context, a 
pilot study was carried out in the automotive industry where managers from 51 US and EU firms were interviewed to 
investigate the 4IR technologies adopted within their manufacturing practices. The aim of the current study is to 
examine the most utilized 4IR solutions among 16 key technologies and then to tackle the correlations between those 
and multiple operational performance metrics (OPMs). Findings showed that more than 80% of the respondents were 
implementing multiple 4IR technologies at a time. The latter was found to be significantly correlated with the studied 
OPMs. The technologies that mostly improve quality were Cloud Computing (p < .05), Additive Manufacturing (p < 
.05), and Industrial Internet (p < .01). Additive manufacturing also boosted the efficiency and productivity 
performance (p < .01), while employee morale was positively correlated with Cyber Security implementation (p < 
.01). Furthermore, the better delivery performance was noticed by mainly employing Virtualization (p < .05), and 
Industrial Internet (p < .1). Finally, both Cloud Computing (p < .01) and Cyber Security (p < .05) had a significant 
impact on cost reduction.

1. Introduction 
The new I4T are transforming the manufacturing industry business model. Over the past decade, I4T is facing 
increasing attention by both scholars and practitioners due to its ability to achieve high competitiveness growth and 
innovation (Liao et al., 2017; Quezada et al., 2017). These new technologies enable organizations to support 
production efficiency (El-Khalil et al., 2020), productivity (El-Khalil, 2020), agility (El-Khalil and Mezher, 2020), 
and flexibility (El-Khalil and Mezher, 2020; El-Khalil & Nader, 2020) through a plethora of technologies, such as 
artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, cloud computing (Kouatli, 2019; Skafi et al., 2020), internet of things, 
big data analytics (Singh and El-Kassar, 2019), and blockchain (Dalenogare et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2017). As reported

Abstract 
 
Over the last decades, the world is encountering an increase in global manufacturing competitiveness (GMC). Flexible 
Manufacturing Systems (FMS), a major pillar in achieving GMC, has lately witnessed a unique advancement and 
became a vital part of the intelligent manufacturing system. In order to preserve the industry’s place with all the 
fluctuation in the market environment, an adoption of new manufacturing philosophies such as lean manufacturing 
systems (LMS) and FMS coupled with good sustainability practices remains mandatory. This paper would fill the 
reserach gap by exploring the relationship between FMS, LMS, Sustainability, and their impact on the textile 
industry’s operational performance. Accordingly, the present paper discusses the effect of strategic, operational, and 
tactical flexibility dimensions, lean manufacturing, and sustainability practices (economic, social, and environmental) 
on different operational performance metrics (OPMs). A survey questionnaire was structured based on in-depth 
literature and was conducted in 82 US and European textile facilities. Hypotheses testing and polynomial regression 
coupled to response surface analysis were performed for model validation and detection of significant linear, quadratic, 
and mediating effects of the studied variables on sales, cost, and productivity. The data analysis carried out in the 
present pilot study showed that the LMS implementation played a major role in mediating the FMS-OPMs 
relationships (p < 0.001), while at a time sustainability practices significantly enhanced the positive effect of LMS on 
all OPMs and primarily on sales and productivity while drastically reducing costs (p < .001).

Abstract 
 
Globalization, increasing awareness of environmental issues, and advances in technology have forced manufacturing 
industries to adopt new and innovative practices to navigate these unprecedented challenges. Accordingly, companies 
started to reassemble their distinctive capabilities and supply chain practices to reach customers from different 
geographical locations, increase profits, expand sourcing opportunities, and offer a wide selection of services and 
products. At the same time, firms started to implement lean tools, which are tools that eliminate wastes in the value 
chain, such as Just-In-Time (JIT), 5S, seven wastes, and Kanban. While previous studies asserted the significance of 
implementing lean tools while improving current supply chain and sustainability practices, there has been little 
investigation on the interaction of the three, and their intertwined effect on operational performance. Therefore, the 
purpose of this paper is to explore the link between lean manufacturing, supply chain practices and sustainability 
practices, and their impact on operational performance metrics. A survey questionnaire was developed based on 
previous literature and practitioners’ feedback and sent to 94 American and European Automotive facilities. The 
results generated from the pilot study revealed that there is a significant correlation between lean, supply chain and 
sustainability practices, and operational performance (p < .05). Moreover, the data indicated that lean manufacturing, 
through planning, sourcing, and production constructs enhances delivery, efficiency, and quality (p < .05). In addition, 
supply chain practices, when coupled with sustainability, had a significant positive effect on operational performance 
(p < .001) while at a time, sustainability practices were found to have a significant mediating effect on the lean-
performance relationship (p < 0.001).

Abstract 
 
The constantly changing environment, economic fluctuations, and product and services proliferation made the 
manufacturing plant’s strategic planning a crucial decision any firm should base its operations on. Strategic 
manufacturing planning (SMP) witnessed an increased interest among scholars and practitioners due to its role in 
defining the success of any manufacturing firm. This study found a lack of empirical research, in the food industry, 
on the combined effect of SMP and sustainability on industrial performance. Therefore, this paper investigates the 
interaction between SMP and sustainability practices, and its impact on operational performance metrics (OPMs). A 
survey questionnaire was developed based on previous studies and sent to 104 food manufacturing firms. The survey 
consists of four SMP constructs: comprehensiveness, focus, horizon, and intensity, three sustainability dimensions: 
economic, social, and environmental, and four OPMs: cost, quality, delivery, and employees’ morale and retention. 
The results show significant positive correlations (p < .05) between SMP, sustainability practices, and OPMs. 
Additionally, findings generated from polynomial regression, Sobel-statistics tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
and response surface analysis reveal that sustainability practices play a major role in mediating the relationship 
between strategic manufacturing planning and operational performance (p < .001). This paper is unique in its depth 
and breadth since it is the first study that examines the comprehensive effect of strategic manufacturing planning and 
sustainability practices on the food industry performance. Furthermore, academicians and decision-makers can benefit 
from the developed model in determining the best practices to implement based on the targeted performance metric 
to be improved.

Abstract 
 
Fostering entrepreneurial mindset and opportunity recognition have always been essence in entrepreneurship 
education. Many contextual, environmental, social, personal and psychological factors have been studied in 
entrepreneurship research to understand antecedents of opportunity recognition. To date although studies on 
digitalization in academic entrepreneurship as antecedents of opportunity recognition are a new growing stream of 
research many of these studies are still undertheorized or need a robust theoretical background.  The paper provides 
a literature review on digital learning tools and technologies in entrepreneurship education research and contributes 
to academic entrepreneurship literature through incorporating theoretical framework suggestions.  Scopus is used to 
extract research studies by entering the key work digitalization, digital infrastructure and academic entrepreneurship 
to identify innovative digital technologies used in entrepreneurship education. The study aims to understand 
theoretically how such digital technologies cultivate intellectual capital and entrepreneurial mindset in facilitating 
opportunities in academia. Building upon a multidisciplinary theoretical approach the paper intends to provide a 
conceptual theoretical framework on how innovative digital learning methods provide an effective learning platform 
in cultivating entrepreneurial mindset. Grounded on various cognitive theories, entrepreneurship theory and 
economy theory the paper aims to theoretically address how digital platforms and digital infrastructures contribute to 
opportunity recognition in academic entrepreneurship. The conceptual framework has also implications for cognitive 
processes, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and creativity. Suggestions are provided for future avenues of 
research in entrepreneurship education and curricula.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has driven educational institutions worldwide to shift their mode of delivery online where 
internet connectivity plays a crucial role in the continuity of learning and sustainability of the student outcomes. With 
the Philippines having one of the slowest internet speeds in the world, it is not unusual for students and teachers to 
encounter problems concerning connectivity. The aim of this study is to produce a mobile application that would 
monitor internet connectivity and consumption. The target respondents of this study are students from different 
universities in the National Capital Region. Explanatory Case Study Design is used to determine how and why internet 
connectivity is slow, while Exploratory Case Study Design is used to answer who and what aspects and factors affect 
the internet connectivity. Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model is used to determine the questions to be asked to the 
respondents, on how the data would be analyzed, and the probable solution that would be proposed to answer the main 
problem of the study. The proponents had identified the different user requirements by incorporating Quality Function 
Deployment (QFD) in order to generate specific features that must be included on the mobile application to satisfy 
the user’s needs and expectations.  
Keywords

1. Introduction 
 
Distance learning was widely introduced and adopted in the Philippines because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It is divided into two kinds of delivery: synchronous and asynchronous classes. Synchronous classes pertain to live 
online meetings of the class using various video communications, while the asynchronous classes are self-paced 
wherein videos and tasks are provided for the students to accomplish at a certain amount of time. 
Based on the data of Commission on Higher Education (CHED), there are 3,408,815 college students enrolled 
for the academic year 2019-2020. These students are relying heavily on internet connectivity to attend to their school 
requirements. The Philippines being known for having the second slowest internet connection in Southeast Asia, these 
students usually experience interruption or access issues which in turn, affects their compliance to requirements and 
eventually their learning outcomes. Thus, there is a need for them to track and to gauge their internet connectivity in 
order to show sufficient proof to their respective educational institutions that they have been having difficulties, or 
even to help them decide if it is time to explore other internet service providers.

2875","The proposed design for the mobile application can be seen through Figures 3-5. Figure 3 is the User Set-up 
Profile, where the user can change their profile picture, and edit their first name, last name, gender, location, email 
address and password. Figure 4 shows the App Settings, where the settings of the application show the profile of the 
user, and the other submenus help the user customize their experience. 
Figure 5 shows the dashboards to display the trend of data of the internet stability and speed. There is a 
submenu that allows the user to see the data between internet stability, upload speed and download speed. On the 
visuals, it shows the date, trends and the recording frequency of the data that is user-adjustable to suit their needs. 
6. Conclusion 
 
The continuity of learning through online delivery during the pandemic still faces several challenges among 
the students; one of which is having weak internet connectivity that causes the students to miss their class or fail to 
submit requirements. Through the collated results of survey questionnaires, the proponents of this study had performed 
data analyzation that led to graphical representation consisting of data percentage and frequencies. 
 
The results show that majority of the respondents experience weak internet connectivity. Despite connecting 
to the top service internet provider, there are still instances of losing internet connection 1 to 3 times caused by the 
low signal acquisition from their locales. Another factor of weak internet connectivity was the number of devices or 
individuals connected to the internet, wherein internet connectivity weakens or slows down were due to the bandwidth 
max consumption. The proponents of this study had synthesized that they will build a mobile application for the user 
to monitor their internet stability and bandwidth consumption whenever they are connected to the internet. 
 
The opportunities that the study could offer are applicable not only to its target population but also to the 
mobile developers, internet service providers, and educational institution. These are as follows: 
1. The study would be providing an additive information to internet service providers about the performance of 
the service that their customers are receiving based on their locale. 
2. The collated results of the study will aid mobile developers if they aim to modify the proposed application 
to be developed. 
3. The study will provide educational institutions sufficient proof in giving out consideration to the students in 
accepting work pass the deadline due to internet complications. 
4. The developed application will be able to send a notification of internet disconnection to the user, thus they 
could also export the dashboard as a valid proof of their weak internet connectivity on that period. 
5. The application that will be developed will help the user to monitor their internet speed, and their 
consumption either chronological (time period) or categorical (downloads, uploads, and stream).

Abstract  
 
The development and growth of technology in Indonesia gave rise to various types of new e-commerce. Various 
categories are available in e-commerce at this time, such as fashion, food, daily necessities, electronics and others. 
Fashion is the category with the largest consumer interest, but the fashion industry is also the biggest contributor to 
environmental damage. Public awareness of environmental damage raises the trend of buying and selling preloved 
goods or commonly called thrifting. Carousell app becomes one of the used goods trading platform that in reality still 
gets a lot of complaints from customers in various media. This research aims to find out and analyze the impact of 
service quality and Consumer Trust on customer loyalty in the Carousell App. This research uses quantitative method 
with descriptive research type. Sampling technique uses nonprobability sampling technique with saturated sampling 
category involving 385 respondents. Data analysis techniques using descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression 
analysis with the help of SPSS version 25. Based on the results of descriptive analysis of variable Service Quality, 
Consumer Trust and Overall Customer Loyalty in the good category. The magnitude of the influence of Service 
Quality and Consumer Trust was 74.47% and the remaining 25.53%% was influenced by other variables not studied 
in this study. Partially Service Quality and Consumer Trust have a significant impact on Customer Loyalty on the 
Carousell App. The highest influence is the Quality of Service and followed by Consumer Trust.

1. Introduction  
 
The development of internet and technology, puts Indonesia in the position of one of the highest ranked 
internet users and puts Indonesia at number 1 on e-commerce adaptation in the world. The development of e-commerce 
in Indonesia gave rise to a variety of e-commerce with their own uniqueness. Various types of goods and services are 
available on e-commerce and make it easier for consumers to meet their needs and desires. Reported in 
Indonesiabaik.id, the most purchased goods by consumers are in the fashion category with a percentage of 68% 
followed by gadgets 44% and electronics 35%. Fashion is one of the biggest contributors to environmental damage 
especially fast-fashion. Awareness of the environmental damage caused by fashion gave rise to preloved trends and 
became a high business opportunity. Many e-commerce provides features to resell used goods owned, such as 
Carousell, Bukalapak, Tinkerlust, OLX and many others. Carousell app is one of the containers to sell and buy used 
goods that make it easier for consumers to reuse items that are still worth using. However, the Carousell App still 
ranks quite low compared to similar apps. Reported on Similarweb.com, Carousell placed 18th in the App Store and 
34th in the Play Store. The loyalty of customers using the Carousell app is one of the reasons why the Carousell app 
ranks low. Customer loyalty can mean that customers continue to use and re-use the services provided. According to 
Boonlertvanich (2018:279) ""sercive quality is the antecendent of customer loyalty."" Which means customer loyalty 
will appear if there is a quality of service in it. The authors found several reviews mentioning complaints from 
Carousell app users who complained about the poor quality of service provided. In addition to the quality of service, 
the problems experienced by users of the Carousell app are a matter of trust, while trust is a foundation of a business 
to continue to be sustainable. According to Kotler &Keller (2016: 225) consumer confidence is ""Trust is the 
willingness of a firm to rely on a business partner. It depends on a number of interpersonal and interorganizational 
factors, such as the firm's perceived competence, integrity, honesty and benevolence"", the point of the theory is trust

Table 5. indicates that the R value of 0.863 and R square (R2) are 0.745. The figure is used to look at the huge 
influence of service quality and consumer confidence on customer loyalty simultaneously. How to calculate R square 
by using a coefficient of determination (KD) by using the following formula: 
KD = R2 x 100% 
KD = (0.863)2 x 100% 
KD = 74.47% 
The figure shows a determination coefisen (KD) of 74.47%. this indicates that the influence of independent 
variables (Quality of Service and Consumer Confidence) on dependent variables i.e. Customer Loyalty is 74.47%. 
While the remaining 25.53% was influenced by other factors not studied in this study. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research and discussion on "" The Effect Of Service Quality And Consumer Trust On Consumer 
Loyalty At Carousell App"", can be concluded as follows: 
1. 
Service Quality in Carousell App is in good category  
2. 
Consumer Confidence in the Carousell App is in a good category.  
3. 
Customer Loyalty in the Carousell App is in either category.  
4. 
Service Quality and Consumer Confidence have partially influenced customer loyalty in the Carousell App. 
The variables that have the most significant influence are the quality of service and the least consumer 
confidence. 
5. 
Service Quality and Consumer Confidence simultaneously have a significant impact on customer loyalty in 
the Carousell App. The amount of simultaneous influence of service quality and consumer confidence on 
customer loyalty was 74.47% and the remaining 25.53% was influenced by other factors not studied in this 
study, such as system quality factors, information quality and purchasing decisions. 
We advise the Carousell App to pay attention to and provide quality assurance of service, attention and confidence 
assurance, still need to be improved such as more responsive service and processing information from sellers so that 
consumers feel confident to use the Carousell App. In addition,Carousell App management is expected to conduct 
further verification of sellers as well as buyers to minimize sellers and buyers who have the potential to commit fraud.

2887","Because fraud can occur from both sides both buyers and sellers.  The Carousell App is expected to add features and 
fix crashes or lags so that it's convenient to use the Carousell App and reluctant to move to similar apps. 
This study only examines the effect of service quality and consumer confidence on customer loyalty in the Carousell 
App, so for the next researcher it is recommended: Conduct research on other similar companies using the same 
variables so that the results can be compared. Then,conduct research on variables that are not studied in this study, 
such as information quality, system quality and purchasing decisions to see how much influence other variables are 
not studied in this study.andconduct research on the same variables with different expert theories so as to expand the 
science of libraries on variable qualityof service, consumer confidence and customer loyalty.

Abstract  
 
GoFood is an online food delivery service on the Gojek application that leads the market share in Indonesia with 
transaction growth that exceeds transportation service transactions and has the highest brand identity, does not 
guarantee satisfaction to GoFood users. There are many complaints that consumers feel when using GoFood services, 
related to problems of trust in the service due to mismatches in customer expectations of GoFood services. This 
problem, if left unchecked, can affect customer satisfaction (e-customer satisfaction) so that it can reduce consumer 
loyalty (e-customer loyalty). This study aims to determine the effect of e-trust on e-customer loyalty through e-
customer satisfaction on GoFood service users in Indonesia. This type of research is descriptive and causal with a 
quantitative approach. Sampling in this study using a non-probability sampling method with a purposive sampling 
type of 100 people. The analysis technique used in this research is Structural Equity Modeling (SEM) processed with 
SmartPLS software. The results of his research prove that e-trust does not have a positive and insignificant effect on 
e-customer loyalty, e-trust has a positive and significant effect on e-customer satisfaction, e-customer satisfaction has 
a positive and significant effect on e-customer loyalty, e-trust has a positive and significant effect on e-customer 
loyalty through e-customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction  
 
Use of the internet today is the result of the development of increasingly sophisticated technology (Pradana et al., 
2021). Technological developments have changed the way humans live from time to time (Sulistijono et al., 2020). 
Along with the development of technology, all activities carried out conventionally have turned completely digital. In 
Indonesia, the rapid development of technology encourages the creation of new business opportunities. One of them 
is an application-based food delivery service launched by Gojek, namely GoFood. Reported from idntimes.com that 
the emergence of food delivery application-basedservices can change consumer behavior in terms of selling and 
buying food. GoFood is an food delivery service online on the Gojek application that leads the market share in 
Indonesia with transaction growth that exceeds transportation service transactions and has the highest brand identity. 
This service aims to make it easier for customers to meet their needs to order food without having to come directly to 
the place where the food seller wants them (Pradana & Wisnu, 2021). 
During the pandemic Covid-19 in Indonesia, food delivery was very popular with the public. Because consumers 
cannot leave the house to enjoy food at a restaurant, ordering food through an application online is the best choice. 
According to Rosel Lavina, Vice President Corporate Affairs of Gojek Food Ecosystem, online food-to-order 
transactions through GoFood increased by 20 percent during the pandemic Covid-19. This is supported by the 
existence of electronic trust in businesses that online can provide satisfaction to consumers so that it can increase 
customer loyalty to the business (Kartawinata et al., 2020). Customer loyalty is a clear aspect that comes from the

5.2 Suggestions 
5.2.1 Suggestions For Companies 
1. GoFood it is better to pay attention to and increase E-Trust regarding the statement that received the lowest 
response, namely ""During thepandemic Covid-. 19, GoFood provides accurate product information”. For 
example, informing valid product information so that the truth can be trusted 
2. GoFood should pay attention to and increase E-Customer Satisfaction regarding the statement that received 
the lowest response, namely “During the pandemic Covid-19, I was interested in the menu recommendations 
provided by GoFood."" It is recommended to periodically change menu recommendations in order to 
minimize customer disinterest. 
3. GoFood should pay attention to and increase E-Customer Satisfaction regarding the statement that received 
the lowest response, namely “I liked the attractive appearance of GoFood services during the pandemic 
Covid-19 (like #dirumahaja)”. For example, improving the appearance by adding a tagline unique so that it 
is liked by users.

lowest response, namely ""During the pandemic Covid-19, I became a regular customer of GoFood services"". 
For example, by providing offers such as promotions and discounts on a regular basis in order to attract users. 
This research only examines the effect of E-Trust on E-Customer Loyalty through E-Customer Satisfaction on GoFood 
service users during the pandemic Covid-19 in Indonesia, so for further researchers it is suggested: 
1. Conducting other research on other companies. using the same variables, so that the results can be used as a 
comparison. 
2. Conducting research on variables not examined in this study based on the results of the study has a significant 
influence on E-Customer Loyalty such as promotion, repurchase intention which may have a greater and 
significant effect on E-Customer Loyalty. 
3. Conduct research on thevariable E-Trust by using the theory of different and latest experts, so that it can add 
to the wealth of knowledge in the field of marketing.

1. Introduction  
 
The development of technology is currently moving very fast, humans now rarely 
communicate face-to-face, because they have switched to conversation in writing (Sulistijono et al., 
2020). In simple terms, it can be said that the internet is the language of the world's computer 
networks, all speaking the same language. Internet technology has also been increasingly used by 
various organizations, especially business organizations (Pradana & Wisnu, 2021). By utilizing 
internet technology, companies can carry out various business business activities electronically, such 
as business transactions, sharing information with consumers and suppliers to maintain relationships 
before, during and after the transaction process and product purchases, as well as marketing products 
online. This triggered the birth of e-business or e-commerce which was created for business 
transactions using the internet and the use of the web where people made it easier to make 
transactions because they no longer needed labor and time to find the items we needed or often 
referred to as online transactions and enable the buying and selling process not to be hindered by 
distance and time (Kartawinata et al., 2020). One of the online shopping applications most often used 
by consumers to shop is Shopee. Shopee is a mobile application the first marketplace that is easy and 
practical in buying and selling online. 
Before making a purchase, consumers usually make comparisons in terms of promotions and 
prices on the Shopee application. According to (Philip Kotler, 2016) promotion is an activity that 
communicates product advantages and persuades target customers to buy it. Promotion is an 
important source in disseminating information for the products offered and one of the marketing

2899","very good, good, and good enough. Impulse Buying is quite attractive to consumers because not 
many of them can determine what to buy and what not to use so that consumers can buy products on 
the Shopee application because there are no prior plans. 
 
4.1 The Influence of Promotion and Price on Impulse Buying of Shopee Users 
 
Promotion variables and price simultaneously influence impulse buying at Shopee. It can be seen 
from the results of the F test (simultaneous) shows that the value of F-count is 38.950 and the value 
of f table is 3.09 with a significance of 0.000 and the effect is 44.5% simultaneously. This shows that 
44.5% of impulse buying is influenced by promotions and prices. While the remaining 55.5% is 
influenced by other variables not examined in this study. Thus it can be concluded that the promotion 
and price variables simultaneously have a significant effect on impulse buying at Shopee. Based on 
the results of the partial t test, it can also be concluded that the promotion and price variables partially 
have a positive and significant effect on impulse buying at Shopee. 
From the conclusions described above, the authors try to provide suggestions that can be used 
for company improvement and insights for future researchers. The suggestions from the author are 
as follows: 
a. Based on the research results, the promotional variable dimensions that have the lowest value 
are the sales promotion dimension with the statement ""Shopee gave me points after I reviewed 
the items purchased"". Therefore, researchers provide suggestions for Shopee to give points 
to consumers who provide reviews in the form of text that contains an explanation of the 
product, not only giving points to consumers who provide reviews in the form of photos or 
videos. 
b. Based on the research results, the variable price dimension which has the lowest value is the 
dimension of affordability with the statement ""I often shop at Shopee because the prices 
offered are affordable"". Therefore, researchers provide suggestions for Shopee to pay more 
attention to the prices set so that the prices of Shopee products can be reached by the public 
and can compete with other e-commerce applications, one example is by giving discounts or 
giving free shipping on repeat purchases. 
c. Based on the results of research, the dimension of impulse buying variable which has the 
lowest value is the dimension of indifference to the consequences with the statement ""When 
buying goods at Shopee, consumers do not think about the mismatch of the product being 
purchased"". Therefore impulse buying activities are expected to meet consumer needs and 
the impulse buying system is also expected to benefit consumers so that these activities can 
provide motivation for consumers to buy a product. 
 
4.2 Suggestions for Further Researchers 
 
It is recommended for further researchers to be able to examine other factors that can 
influence Impulse Buying Shopee users, for example: Electronic Word Of Mouth and so on. Conduct 
research using the theory of different and latest experts so that it can enrich the treasury of science 
in the field of marketing. Conduct research on other similar companies using the same variables so 
that the results can be used as a comparison.

Abstract 
Over the years, many South African industries have been using Forklift trucks to move bigger loads from one 
point to another till today. The use of large forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing processes poses OHS risks 
to workers as its Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) produces fumes (Carbon Monoxide, CO) when in operation 
and exhaust fumes, (CO), are harmful to human’s health. On this basis, a new system design is recommended to 
eliminate the use of MHS that relies on ICE power source to prevent OHS risks in indoor manufacturing industries. 
In this project, Autodesk Inventor Professional software was used for design development of technical drawings 
and simulation as well as validation of the new system’s structure. Vehicle Dynamics’ principles and equations 
are used to determine the overall Rolling Resistance, Tractive Effort of the new system, wheel torque, and the 
power required to drive the system under 20 – ton load capacity. The new system design has been developed to 
operate using a Hydraulic Power pack source, where it consists of four hydraulic wheel hubs for driving the system, 
four hydraulic cylinders for lifting & lowering, and a double rod end hydraulic cylinder for steering. Electro-
Hydraulic circuit systems were developed and proposed using electronics and fluid mechanics phenomena. Again, 
principles, laws and equations of Strength of Materials has been carried out for validation of the material selection 
of the new design system’s structure as well as verifying buckling, deflection & bending stresses, and moments.

1.  Introduction  
The aim of this document is to model and analyze the performance of the final design chosen for the design of a 
Tri-adjustable Automated Heavy-Duty Handling System based in Industry 4.0 principles. The design parameters 
of the selected concept, thus for the new system includes calculation & verification of Vehicle Dynamics of the 
new system, Stress Analysis of the main structure and hoisting mechanism, and Hydraulic Power pack validation 
in terms verifying operating pressures for the hydraulic system. Calculations of the new model were carried out in 
this chapter considering the different varying design parameters (Mainly SWL & Frame structure material) of the 
new system. The specification of the new design system should be accurate to achieve the correct results and/or 
outcomes for safe operation and proper handling of goods in the workplace (Mafokwane, at el., 2019).   
2. Technical Calculations of the New System Design 
This section focuses on verifying and validating the new system’s stability, and performance. Whereby the overall 
system, based on material and components selected to form the new design, must be able to lift, lower and be able 
to move even when under maximum load. Therefore, engineering principles, laws and equation are carried out is 
achieving.

7.2. Front and Rear Wheel Hub Support Brackets weld summary 
The new system design’s hub support bracket materials have been chosen to be 40 mm thick plates. Available 
Carbon Steel plates available from the market ranges from 16 - 40 mm in thickness, therefore, for the design of 
hub bracket, thickest steel plate was chosen for over design purposes since the new system will be operating under 
heavy loads (20 – ton). Simulations of fabricated 40 mm thick steel plates will be simulated and evaluated in 
(Mafokwane and Kallon, 2019; Mafokwane and Kallon, 2020 ). Referring to Table 4, fabricated rear and front 
wheel hub support brackets have a Nominal fillet Size of 10.0 mm & Throat Thickness of 7.0 mm. 
8. Conclusion 
The research beacame a success whereby a new proposed MHS has been designed using Autodesk Inventor 
Professional and material selection of the new design system’s components has been carried out and verified in 
relation with their strength & reliability properties. Through this paper and its engineering analysis, it is proven 
that the use of internal combustion engines in heavy duty handling systems that are operated within indoor 
manufactring factories and or internal logistics can be eliminated and replaced with an eco-friendly hydraulic 
systems technology. Therefore, this new system design promotes Occupational Health and Safety of people 
working in industrial areas where Bulk Material Handling systems are in place. 
The new system was designed and it consist of four double-acting hydraulic cylinders interconnected with spreader 
beam responsible for lifting and lowering, as well as two double-acting hydraulic cylinders that will expand the 
system making it adjustable, a hydraulic steering cylinder for steering & turning the wheels and four hydraulic 
motors that will drive the system from point A to point B. Electric hydraulic components selection for new design 
system has been conducted. 
Vehicle dynamics of the new proposed system were modelled, tested, and verified. The overall system’s TE was 
calculated to discover the power required for the hydraulic wheel hub motor’ to move the new proposed system 
under 20-ton load. When the new design system is under 20-ton load, TE was found to be 250.623 kN, hydraulic 
wheel hub motor torque was 149.1 kN.m and power required to overcome TE was 468.411 W, on each wheel.

Abstract  
 
Pharmaceutical industry is one of the most rising industries in Bangladesh where various types of medicines are 
administrated to people with a view to curing them. Many workers as well as top and middle management are 
responsible to run the industry successfully. But because of not taking proper precautions, different failure causes 
result in various failure modes in each section of the industry that may affect the safety issue of the workers and 
effectiveness of the industry. In this research work, failure caused and failure modes were determined through 
performing a survey. Risk priority number method was evaluated for each failure modes caused by subsequent 
reasons of failures by learning the severity, detection and occurrence of each failure form. The higher risk priority 
number resulted in the greater criticality caused by failure modes. Proper preventive methods were encouraged to 
carry out to mitigate the criticality and to ensure proper working environment for all the workers involved in the 
pharmaceutical industry.

1.0 Introduction 
Pharmaceutical sector is one of the most growing sectors in Bangladesh. After the introduction of drug control 
ordinance in 1982, the condition of pharmaceutical industries of Bangladesh advanced a lot (Reich, 1994).Currently, 
97% of lifesaving products are manufactured in local pharmaceutical companies. Though top pharmaceutical 
industries of Bangladesh, at the current time, are facing a golden age, many local pharmaceutical industries are 
facing barriers due to lack of technical skills in identifying and managing risks and failures. This research work is 
mainly based on a survey conducting in a local pharmaceutical industry with an aim of identifying, prioritizing and 
managing failures and risks occurred in the industry. Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) is an 
established and widely used tool to identify, prioritize and manage failure modes occurring in different processes 
and businesses. FMECA is an efficacious technique for ranking potential failure modes on the basis of RPN (Risk 
Priority Number) which is a product of severity, occurrence probability and likelihood of detection. Failure modes 
having higher RPNs are considered to have a higher risk than those holding lower RPNs. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
The main purposes of the research work are to determine failure causes and failure modes in a pharmaceutical 
industry as well as to evaluate the criticality of the failure modes by establishing or utilizing risk priority number 
method.   
 
2.0 Literature Review 
Many researches have been conducted focusing on both failure modes effects and criticality analysis and RPN 
prioritization for assessing failure modes and risks. In one research, the risk priority number (RPN) methodology, an 
integral part of FMECA technique, was used for prioritizing different failure modes (Bowles, 2004). This research 
illustrated a detailed methodology for assessing RPN in a FMECA technique. 
In another research, a new SAE FAMECA standard was introduced through three major changes for the 
improvement and advancement of FMECA technique with an aim of bringing FMECA technique into modern 
design practices. (Bowles, 1998). Another research was carried out to restore the fruitfulness of failure mode and 
effects analysis (FMEA) (Palady et al., 1994). This research totally focused on the advancement and enhancement of

2922","For ensuring safety of the workers effective methods have to be taken into account. Following preventive techniques 
can be considered in the pharmaceutical industry to reduce the criticality caused by failure caused and their 
subsequent failure modes: 
• 
Proper use of personal protective equipment as well as first aid. 
• 
Suitable arrangement of temperature control (AC, heater, fans etc.). 
• 
Floors must be non-slippery and there should be enough space. In a word, upgrade of the working 
condition. 
• 
Regular inspection of faculty and maintenance of discipline. 
• 
Safety training and campaign must be arranged. 
5.0 Conclusion 
Workers spend most of the time in work place. If there are higher failure modes in the working environment, the 
efficiency as well as the safety of the workers are in stake.  Failure modes and failure causes were evaluated in the 
research work. Also RPN method was prioritized to find out the major failure modes. Risk priority number played a 
vital role to find out the failure causes and failure modes. By analyzing criticality of the failure modes using risk 
priority number method, it was quite obvious that the chances of failures and risks are very high in a pharmaceutical 
industry. These may lead to various types of disorders and accidents. Overall it would have a negative impact on the 
safety culture for the industry. Future preventive methods have to be taken by the management for the safety 
purpose by making availability of the safety instruments as well as establishing discipline and training.

Abstract 
Old age poverty is inevitable in Africa, so is the need for pension provision. The three main public universities (UNZA, 
CBU and MU) in Zambia are facing financial challenges mainly due to the pension systems adopted by these 
institutions of higher learning. In order to curtail the high growth rate of the pension debt, the government expressed 
the need for pension reform in the three universities. The objective of this paper was to draw lessons from pension 
systems adopted by institutions of higher learning outside Zambia. This was a qualitative study that focused mainly 
on the number of pillars adopted by the institutions of higher learning of the selected countries. AN analysis of the 
results indicated that most institutions of higher learning have at least a two-pillar pension system. Further, the results 
revealed that the UK and USA have associations of universities and colleges that play a vital role in the pension reform 
process. The research concludes that saving for retirement is a collective responsibility of both employers and 
recommends for the work on pension reform to be continued in light of experiences of other countries.

1.0 Introduction 
During the year 2017, the Government of Republic of Zambia (GRZ) pronounced the new financing strategy for public 
universities whose aim was to improve the financial position of three public universities namely University of Zambia 
(UNZA), Copperbelt University (CBU) and Mulungushi University (MU), (Ministry of Higher Education, 2018). 
Amongst the objectives of the New Financing Strategy was to abolish the in-house pension schemes and remain with 
the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA). The call to abolish the occupational pension schemes by GRZ, was 
a call for pension reform which inevitably affects the post-employment life of the employees of the universities. Higher 
education is part of the key factors that aids Zambia achieve its Vision 2030 as per the 7 National Development Plan 
(7NDP) 2017 to 2021 (Ministry of National Development Planning, 2017). Zambia has identified enhancement of 
human capital development as one of the five (5) pillars that can enable the country achieve its Vision 2030. The 
7NDP clearly states that country needs to build appropriate skills that respond to the demands of the labour market. 
Building skills that respond to the demands of the dynamic labour market is one of the functions of higher education 
sector (The Higher Education Act, 2013). Consequently, policy reforms to the institutions of higher education in 
Zambia need to consider the possible impact of the pension reforms that may negatively affect the public universities. 
If the pension systems in the public universities point to a poverty-filled post-employment life of the current 
employees, the consequences of high employee turnover may become the norm in the public universities. Gradually, 
the national agenda is negatively affected.  
 
The call for pension reform by the Government of Republic of Zambia was due to the financial challenges faced by 
both government and the public universities. For instance, the 2017 audited (latest) financial statements of the 
University of Zambia state that the institution owed K1.28 billion in pension related debt (Grant Thornton, 2017). The 
2018 budget for the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) was approximately K1.970 billion of which 72.6% (K1, 
430 million) was allocated to University Education (all public universities). Clearly, this shows that the pension 
systems are a source of financial challenges for the public universities and there is a need for pension reform. That 
need was further compounded by the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the performance of pension schemes. Feher

Based on Table 2 above, it is clear that the institutions of higher learning have mostly a two-pillar pension system 
with the exception of Nigeria. It is clear that the occupational pension schemes seek to achieve adequacy of the post-
employment income. The Nigerian pension system inevitably invites questions of adequacy because of the one-pillar 
system. Unique feature exist in both the UK and USA which plays a crucial role in pension reform in the institutions 
of higher learning. Both countries have bodies that solely exists to monitor and review the conditions of service in the 
institutions of higher learning. In the UK there is the Universities UK (UUK), Universities and Colleges Employers 
Association (UCEA) while in the USA there is the National Education Association (NEA). For instance, the UUK 
and UCEA have the responsibility of providing for its members a sustainable and attractive pension system (EPF, 
2017). In the US, the NEA values an adequate and secure retirement package for its members. The presence of these 
bodies contributes towards a pension system that considers the needs of both the current and future employees.  
5.0 Conclusion 
The call for pension reform in public universities in Zambia, is an indicator of both affordability and sustainability of 
the pension systems in the public universities (Ministry of Higher Education, 2018 and Grant Thornton, 2017). The 
aim of this paper was to draw lessons from other countries for the policy-makers in the institutions of higher learning 
in Zambia. The paper adopted a comparative approach by analysing the pension pillar system in Chile, UK, Denmark, 
Ghana, USA, Israel, Nigeria and Zambia. More importantly, the paper discussed the pension system in the institutions 
of higher learning in UK, Israel, USA, Nigeria and Zambia. Arising from the comparative analysis undertaken, the 
following were revealed; 
Firstly, Chile, UK, Denmark and Ghana have a mandatory two-pillar pension system while Zambia has a mandatory 
one-pillar pension system. Secondly, most of the occupational pension system in pillar-two, are DC plans operating 
under highly regulated financial markets in order to protect the retirees’ savings. Third, the institutions of higher 
learning in UK, Israel, USA and Zambia all have a minimum of two-pillars. Lastly, the UK and USA have associations 
that review the conditions of service of the member institutions. Therefore, the following key lessons can be drawn 
from the comparative analysis.                                                                              
First, pension adequacy can be achieved by having more than one-pillar pension system. For instance, the UK basic 
pension is considered the most generous system, but the UK seeks to achieve better adequacy by having mandatory 
workplace pension schemes. In Denmark the occupational pension schemes are enshrined in the collective agreements 
of all employers as a legal requirement for pillar two. Second, saving for retirement is a collective responsibility of 
both the employers and the employees. This is evidenced by the wide existence of DC occupational pension schemes 
in the countries considered in this study. Third, the Government of Republic of Zambia should consider reforms in 
the laws that govern pension administration and financial markets with a view of protecting retirees’ savings. This 
encourages participation from more players. Last, having associations of universities and colleges enhances unit of 
purpose amongst the institutions of higher learning and plays a key role in pension reform. For instance, in the UK, 
the UUK and UCEA work together in promoting the interests of both the employees and employers.  
There are several lessons available to policy-makers from this comparative study apart from the ones identified above. 
As the public universities undertake pension reform process, it is imperative for the policy makers to consider the 
drivers of the proposed reform and the impact on the current and future employees. The policy-makers may wish to 
consider some of the lessons highlighted in this paper especially on the pillar approach without ignoring the income 
replacement ratio regardless of the number of pillars in the pension system. However, more pillars demonstrate a good 
risk management approach in managing the pension related risks. 
This study had its own limitations which can be addressed by future studies. First, the impact of Covid-19 pandemic 
was not intensively considered in this paper but its impact on retirees’ savings is inevitable. Second, the paper adopted 
a qualitative approach leaving room for a quantitative approach. Furthermore, this study can be enriched by including 
more countries and inclusion of replacement ratios for a better comparative study.

1. Introduction 
The development of the industrial sector is one of the indicators that represent economic growth in a country. The 
industrial sector provides supports for economic growth in an area, which is to improve societies’ lives. In this case PT. 
Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial Development sees an excellent opportunity with the increasing demand of industrial 
areas, which has a growth 5.67 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. However, with the recent situation, Indonesia is faced 
with pandemic Covid-19. Based on WHO’s data, Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered type 
of corona virus. Covid-19 is now a pandemic that occurs in many countries around the world. Pandemic Covid-19, creates 
a new perspective in the way of living (Olivia et al., 2020). The pandemic of Covid-19 disturbs many factories or 
industries in being productive while maintaining efficiency. Companies are forced to adjust their business and find a way 
to survive in an unpredictable situation. Companies must remain productive without neglecting their employees’ safety 
and health (Fakhri et al., 2018).

Table 1 show that PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial Development, located in Kabupaten Bekasi, is one area with a 
relatively large number of Covid-19 spreads in West Java. The Indonesian government has implemented policies in 
response to the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the policies is to impose social and physical distancing for the Indonesian 
people at the beginning of March 2020. This policy feels severe in multiple industries, one of many is PT. Megalopolis 
Manunggal Industrial Development, which is engaged in industrial estate development also affected by the policy since

a. 
Effect of Quality of Work life (X) and Organizational Culture (Y) 
 
Based on the results of the study, the path coefficient value for the direct effect of Quality of Work life on 
Organizational Culture is 0.7344 or 73.44% with a significance level of 0.000. This shows that there is a significant 
positive effect of Quality of Work life on Organizational Culture and it can be concluded that if the Quality of Work life 
variable is increased, Organizational Culture at PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial Development will increasing. 
b. Effect of Quality of  (X) on Job Stress (Z) 
Based on the results of the study, the path coefficient value for the direct effect of Quality of Work life on Job 
Stress is 0.0231 or 2,31% with a significance level of 0.177. This shows that there is no significant effect of Quality 
of Work life on Job Stress. So it can be concluded that the optimal application of Quality of Work life will not 
affect Job Stress. 
c. 
The Influence of Quality of Work life (X) on Organizational Culture (Y) through Job Stress (Z) 
Based on the results of the study, the path equation is obtained as follows: 
 
X Z Y = X     Z x Z    Y 
           = -0,152 x -0,004 
           = 0,000608 
From the calculations above, the effect of Quality of Work life on Organizational Culture through Job Stress is obtained 
from the multiplication of the path force coefficient Quality of Work life on job stress (XZ) and the path coefficient 
value of Job Stress on Organizational Culture (ZY) becomes (-0,152 x -0,004) = 0.000608. The multiplication result 
shows that the value of the indirect effect coefficient (XZ x ZY) is smaller than the value of the direct effect coefficient 
(XY) that is, (0.000608 <0.857). This shows that Job Stress (Z) as an intervening variable is able to mediate Quality of 
Work life (X) on Organizational Culture (Y) even though the value of the coefficient direct effect is greater than the 
value of the coefficient indirect effect. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Based on the results of research and discussion that has been stated previously regarding quality of work life on 
organizational culture with job stress as an intervening variable at PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial Development, 
several conclusions can be drawn which are expected to provide answers to the problems formulated in this study are as 
follows: 
a. Quality of Work life PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial Development is in the very good category. 
b. Organizational Culture at PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial Development is in the very good category. 
c. Job Stress at PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial Development is included in the good category. 
d. Quality of Work life partially and significantly influences the Organizational Culture of PT. Megalopolis 
Manunggal Industrial Development. 
e. Partially, Quality of Work life has no significant effect on Job Stress at PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial 
Development. 
f. Partially Job Stress has no significant effect on Organizational Culture of PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial 
Development. 
g. Quality of Work life has a significant effect on Organizational Culture of PT. Megalopolis Manunggal Industrial

Abstract  
 
Bandung is the capital city of West Java which has the largest economic growth rate in Indonesia. In 2017, the 
economic growth rate of Bandung City was at 7.21 percent, beating the national economic growth rate of only 5.07 
percent. To maintain stability and reduce the level of inflation and increase the rate of economic growth in the city of 
Bandung is not easy. Moreover, the city of Bandung, which has the character of a consumptive city where people still 
depend on buying products from outside the region, is the cause of the price of goods to rise on weekends. 
Millennial today are currently aged 20 to 40 years, and seen from the proportion, more have status as students. as a 
student today, he is able to absorb various kinds of information that can be obtained from various sources, both official 
and unofficial media. This makes the lifestyle of millennial students who are students seem to have a high lifestyle, 
by often gathering at cafes, becoming a traveler, very happy to have a vacation to exotic tourist places and of course 
it costs a lot to get there etc. 
The method used in this research is quantitative method with descriptive and causal research types. The population in 
this study were students in the city of Bandung, amounting to less than 1 million  people. The sampling technique 
used is a non-probability sampling method with sub-sampling purposive sampling technique with a total of 400 
respondents. The data analysis technique used descriptive analysis techniques and multiple linear regression analysis. 
The results of the study concluded that from the results of the t test, financial behavior, and lifestyle had a positive 
and significant effect on personal financial management in student  in Bandung. Based on the results of the F test, 
financial behavior and lifestyle together have an influence on personal financial management in students in the city of 
Bandung.

Abstract  
 
Supply chain design is unique to a particular industry.  Supply chain of a company consists of different elements (viz. 
Planning, Information, Sourcing, Inventory and manufacturing). Earlier elements of the supply chain used to work in 
isolation. Information sharing was very difficult and was not in real-time. IIoT has made information sharing across 
the elements of the supply chain possible and in real-time. IIoT has increased transparency in information sharing. 
This will make the supplier, manufacturer, and customer to be in synchronization. This has brought down 
inefficiencies in the supply chain. This has also increased trust among the members of the chain. This has reduced the 
wastes related to the communication gaps. IIoT has helped companies in making their customers happy, by supplying 
quality products on time. With the introduction of I4.0, many researchers have applying Industry 4.0 technologies for 
designing a company’s supply chain. I4.0 is becoming popular among practitioners and researchers, in the design of 
an organization’s supply chain (SC). This is mainly because, by using I4.0, sup-ply chain will become more flexible, 
efficient, quick and become transparent among SC elements. An attempt is made in this research work is to review 
the existing technologies and then present future research directions. This would help those who are interested in 
pursuing further research.

1.Introduction  
This article intends to explain how the advent of I4.0 has affected the supply chain design. This article has been 
arranged into three sections. First section describes the supply chain concepts. Second section describes the relevance 
of SC design and its status as of today. Third section is dedicated for explaining the future directions for designing 
different components of SC using I4.0 technologies. The ultimate objective of using I4.0 in supply chain design is to 
achieve operational excellence, transparency.  
A Supply chain (SC) consists of the process of buying raw materials from vendors for the manufacture of products 
through to their distribution and sale. Many companies have failed in terms of managing their supply chain challenges. 
Thus, effective management of company’s supply chain is very much required for its survival. This has made many 
researchers to work on supply chain design. Research has shown that managing supply chain volatility has led to the 
success of a company (Fair et al., 1989; Blinder et al.,1986).

Literature review 
I4.0 technologies may include - IoT, mobile, augmented reality, sensors, additive manufacturing, Big-Data, etc. (Ornig 
et al.,2016). These technologies are being used for designing a company’s SC, by researchers. The main purpose 
behind using I4.0 (Figure 1) is to ensure operational excellence. Also, to make a company’s supply chain quick, 
flexible, and to become transparent. This is going to make all the elements of SC  (Figure 2) work in seamless fashion. 
This will make the company in meeting customer’s expectations. An effort has been made to show how the different 
components of supply chain (Figure 3) can be designed by using Industry 4.0.

2966",,"Research work showed that a company’s supply chain is comprised of many components-inventory, planning, 
manufacturing, sourcing, and information. Earlier companies have had problems while dealing with each of these 
components. Companies were looking for ways for addressing many of the problems related to these components. 
The article also shows how researchers have implemented Industry 4.0 technology in enhancing the performance of 
the components of the SC. By using I4.0 technologies, researchers have made the supply chain flexible. The supply 
chain also became, quick and efficient, and also work seamlessly, for meeting the requirements of the customers. 
Despite all these advantages, IIoT enabled supply chains to have many challenges. Organizations will become 
successful only if these challenges are properly managed. 
 
RFID-based sensors are becoming very popular in managing a company’s inventory system. Nowadays, real-time 
information about the type, number, and location of raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods, can be 
made available with the help of RFID-based sensors and IIoT infrastructure. This was not possible earlier. This has 
enhanced the transparency and accuracy of information. This can make company’s take the correct decisions at the 
required point in time. 
 
Earlier elements of the SC used to work in isolation. Information sharing was very difficult and was not in real-time. 
IIoT has made information sharing across the elements of the supply chain possible and in real-time. IIoT has increased 
transparency in information sharing. This will make the supplier, manufacturer, and customer to be on the same page. 
This has brought down inefficiencies in the supply chain. This has also increased trust among the members of the 
chain. This has reduced the wastes related to the communication gaps. IIoT has helped companies in making their 
customers happy, by supplying quality products on time. 
 
Sensors used in IIoT implementation are heterogeneous. Thus, there is a need for dealing with vast amounts of 
structured and unstructured data. As data have different formats, it becomes very difficult to manage these types of 
data. Especially, storing vast amounts of data in a meaningful way is becoming very difficult. Many of the existing 
database systems cannot be used. Separate data warehouses are required. They also demand huge requirements 
concerning the hardware. Industry 4.0 offers Big-data analytics for managing a vast amount of data.  Industry 4.0 also 
offers cloud-based technology for achieving connectedness and flexibility.  
 
Though many researchers have demonstrated how supply chain efficiency can be enhanced. Still, much research work 
needs to be done in the area such as the protection of CPS. This is because CPS are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The 
cyber-attacks do differ from one another. This shows that solving problems related to cyber-attacks are very dynamic. 
Every cyber-attack is unique and varies across domains. What is secured today may not be true for tomorrow. This 
will add up to the complexity of the problem. Intruder detection, and locating, the position and posture of an intruder 
is done by using machine learning and CNN. However, much research work remains to be done in improving the 
accuracy of intruder detection and in making the system robust. 
 
The main advantage of additive manufacturing is that complex products can be made. The products made by additive 
manufacturing are relatively costly. Thus, there is much scope for reducing the cost of manufacturing. This will go a 
long way in making AM useful in many un-touched areas. The additive manufacturing process consumes more energy 
than the conventional manufacturing process. Thus, presently additive manufacturing is not eco-friendly. Much 
research work is needed in making the additive manufacturing eco-friendly.

Abstract  
 
With the advent of Industry 4.0, many physical systems are transforming into cyber-physical systems (CPS). As these 
CPS are connected to the internet, have a lot of vulnerabilities. There is a need to protect them from cyber-attacks. 
This is true across domains. Many cyber-attacks are being reported in the literature. These cyber-attacks had 
devastating effects. The cyber-attacks not only result in an economic loss but also resulted in the loss of effort and 
inconvenience. Hence a complete understanding of the type of cyber-attacks and predicting the behavior of intruders 
is very much important for protecting CPS. Though many cyber-attacks are reported across multiple domains, the type 
of attacks is unique about each domain. This makes solving security problems even more difficult. What is also 
observed from the literature review is that the security infrastructure that is available today may not be secure for 
tomorrow. This clearly shows the complexity of solving the security problems- Intrusion detection system(IDS). 
Hence, an effort has been made in this work to consolidate different types of attacks reported across multiple domains. 
This is valuable not only for academicians but also for researchers and practitioners, as this paper contains not only 
the work reported so far but also provides future directions for promoting further research in the area of intruder 
detection.

1.Introduction  
The main objective of designing an IDS) is to identify all types of suspicious network related traffic that cannot be 
identified by a normal firewall. Normally an IDS is consisting of components such as Console, Sensors, and Detection 
engine. Many industrial applications use different types of IDS. Different type of IDS differs by the type of sensors 
used, position of these sensory devices and the method used for the generation alarms by the detecting engine. 
Security-based solutions can be of two types- prevention-based methods and detection-based methods. Prevention-
based methods use encryption and authentication as means of protecting against possible attacks.  Detection-based 
methods are used when prevention methods fail. The detection methods are -Signature detection (Figure 1)- This 
technique use known patterns for detecting malicious traffic; Anomaly detection (Figure 2) - These detection 
techniques are designed in such a way that they can detect abnormal behavior in the system; Hybrid methods combine 
one or more methods. Certain type of IDS is passive in that security breach will be detected by an IDS sensor and the 
event is logged and will be reported on the console. In an intrusion prevention system, known as reactive systems, the 
IDS sensor will respond to the malicious work either by resetting the connection or by recoding the firewall, to block 
the network traffic from the suspicious source.  A worm is any malicious code that can replicate and spread on its 
own. A worm in the first step scans the given network for identifying any vulnerabilities. Then, the worm will exploit 
the weakness and finally attacks the network. 
  
An attempt has been made, in the following paragraphs, to capture not only the different types of cyber-attacks but 
also the techniques used for implementing intruder detection in different domains. Also, future research directions are 
provided for interested academicians, practitioners, and researchers.

2977","3 Conclusion 
With the advent of Industry 4.0, many types of equipment used in manufacturing and other domains are being 
transformed into cyber-physical systems. These cyber-physical systems are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As 
they are exposed through the internet. Thus, they require protection from cyber-attacks. Many researchers have been 
working on intrusion detection techniques for protecting these cyber-physical systems. The types of cyber-attacks are 
unique to each domain. Hence, an attempt is made in this research work to portray the different cyber protection 
schemes implemented in (i) Smart Grids (ii) Nuclear Power Plants (iii) Cross Border Intruder detection. Figure 10 
shows the research progress in different domains about intruder detection. As can be seen from figure 10, much work 
has been done in the area of smart grids. Much work remains to be done in other areas. With the advent of Big-data 
analytics and cloud-based wireless sensor networks, data capture, data storage, analysis, and decision making have 
become more efficient. Researchers have claimed that this architecture achieves efficient results regarding analysis, 
storage, and also performance in intruder detection. The researchers have also studied the performance of the system 
using the CloudSim simulator. The researchers have also studied the effect on storage cost by using the number of 
servers ranging from 30-50. One of the objectives of Intruder detection is to increase the accuracy of intruder 
identification. To address the limitations of HIDS, a researcher has proposed an intelligent intruder detection system 
that will improve the reliability and efficiency of IDS in nuclear companies. This scheme make use of two cameras 
and deep learning technologies for tracking intruder behavior detection. When the size of data, coming from camera 
sensors, increases, using a single server will take more data processing time. In such scenarios, it is advisable to go 
for the parallel processor. The size of the data may be as huge as 100GB. Researchers have used spark workstations 
fitted with the graphic processing unit.  
 
Most cyber-physical smart grids are also provided with mitigation efforts for achieving a compromise between the 
system and the attacker to reduce the undesired impacts of cyber-attacks Sequential optimization is normally used to 
achieve the objectives. Many of these techniques have assumed fixed behavior from different attackers. This is a very 
unrealistic assumption. Cyber-attacks do vary from attacker to attacker. One of the biggest challenges in designing a 
system against cyber-attacks is that the attacks vary continuously from time to time. Though many researchers have 
been working, over the years, in designing effective intruder detection algorithms, much work needs to be done in 
enhancing the security level offered by intruder detection schemes. Also, it is observed that there is a need to improve 
the detection accuracy, detection speed, and robustness of the detection algorithms. Also, there is a need for further 
reduction in the costs of hardware such as thermal camera and Vision camera to make the intruder detection system 
more economical. This would enable the Intruder detection schemes to be used in other domains as well. As of today, 
Intruder detection systems are being used only in few domains. There is a wide scope for implementing intruder 
detection systems in aerospace, shipbuilding, construction, hospitals, agriculture, textiles, banking, and other non-
manufacturing industries as well. There is a wide scope for using a heterogenous swarm of cyber-physical systems for 
both intruder detection as well as monitoring the intruders. There is also a wide scope of using robotic swarms for 
monitoring and detecting intruders. The trend is intellectualization and integration with multiple sensors to enhance 
the overall security of the cyber-physical system.  
 
To meet the security-related challenges of today’s industries, there is a need for designing and developing a 
heterogenous swarm of cyber-physical systems, for comprehensively understanding the state of the given system. 
Also, there is a wide scope for introducing the evolutionary features inherent in the biological systems. Thus, interested 
researchers may use an artificial intelligence-based heterogeneous swarm of cyber-physical systems, for addressing 
or addressing the security problems of industries. Many use cases will have to be demonstrated by researchers 
regarding crisis management and monitoring industrial premises by using robotics swarms.

Abstract  
 
Abstract. The Industrial Internet of things is getting more attention nowadays both from academia and industry. 
IoT would help in connecting objects to the internet. Here the object may mean differently in different domains. In 
the context of the manufacturing domain, the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) would help in connecting all elements 
including different types of machines and material handling devises used in product manufacturing. IIoT may be 
defined as a set of interconnected intelligent machines with reduced operational cost and capable of monitoring on 
their own. IIoT is also known by other names such as Industry 4.0, Industrial IoT, and Smart manufacturing. IIoT not 
only would help in connecting machines through the wireless network but also enable machine-machine 
communication with minimum human intervention. IIoT would make use of sensors for collecting data about product 
manufacturing. IIoT is capable of handling modern-day complex business processes. Industrial Internet (IIoT) 
provides better visibility in terms of understanding operations of the company by making use of sensors, hardware, 
software, and the cloud. Improved decisions are possible using IIoT, hence many industries have started implementing 
IIoT. The main objective of this article is to review existing technologies, identify gaps and provide direction for 
further research. 
 
Keywords  
Industry 4.0, Smart Healthcare, Smart Manufacturing, Smart city, Smart surveillance, Smart agriculture

Introduction 
Many Industries predict that there is a bright future for IIoT. The industries have already started working at a high 
pace for harnessing the full potential of IIoT. However, IIoT is still in its infancy. Though many industries have started 
implementing IIoT, they are facing huge challenges. To become successful, they have to overcome these challenges.  
Also, for becoming successful, a complete understanding of IIoT is required. One of the challenges in IIoT is to get 
data from different types of sensors and also their organized storage.  Also, the large amount of data generated during 
manufacturing can be used by IIoT devices for reducing the cost of production thereby improving the productivity of 
the organization. Thus, IIoT is a subset of IoT but the focus is on manufacturing a product safely, efficiently, and 
meeting customer expectations. IIoT implementation typically involves applications such as machine learning, edge 
computing, cloud computing, etc.). Thus, IIoT has the objective of making intelligent decisions for serving people 
working in the industry as well as help in meeting customer expectations.  
 
According to one survey, 70 billion devices will be connected through the internet by 2025 and their market share will 
be around 14 trillion US Dollars. 
 
Before implementing IoT technologies, certain points will have to be understood- IoT technologies have made 
efficient usage of raw materials in product manufacturing, there is a possibility of large amounts of electronic waste 
generation due to IIoT implementation, IoT implementation may result in the reduction of labor which is the biggest

To protect citizens from deadly diseases and to secure their life is another problem that requires the immediate 
attention of researchers. This is possible when the applications develop the ability to inform citizens in advance about 
the impending pandemic. This is very much required in sectors such as Smart city management, Nuclear-power plants, 
and Power generation units.

1. Introduction  
In this highly advanced technology era, human resources are still one of the most important factors in various 
industrial sectors. One of the industries that still need human resources is the education sector. To make a country able 
to compete with other countries, it requires good quality education. The quality of good education cannot be separated 
from the quality of the teaching staff. The quality of teaching staff can be seen through the Education Quality 
Assurance System (SPMP) in Permendiknes No. 63 of 2009 that quality assurance is a series of processes and systems 
related to collecting, analyzing and reporting quality data on the performance of staff / teachers, programs, and 
institutions.   
In the dimension of education quality assurance which has 8 indicators, one of which is the standard indicator for 
educators and educational personnel. From the standpoint of Educator Standards and Education Personnel Standards, 
it turns out that Sleman Regency also has the lowest standard scores for teaching staff compared to other districts, this 
shows that the performance of teachers in the district is also relatively low. While the target of education quality in 
the district. Sleman has a value of 84.01. 
Teacher performance is the ability and success of the teacher in carrying out learning tasks [1]. Things that affect 
a person's performance, namely: (1) Motivation; (2) Job satisfaction; (3) stress level; (4) Working conditions or 
environment; (5) Compensation; (6) Design work [2]. 
To find out what factors influence the performance of teachers at the Cluster 08 Public Elementary School in 
Yogyakarta, researchers conducted questionnaires (pre-survey). The results of the pre-survey conducted by 
researchers are as follows: Motivation has a percentage of 46%, job satisfaction of 90%, stress level of 76.7%, work 
environment of 75%, compensation of 65% and work design of 63%. Motivation has the lowest percentage. For this

Abstract 
This study aims to measure and analyze the government and health educators' role on community behaviour and its 
impact on oral health in the Durikumba Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency. It was 
researched at the Durikumba Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency. The sampling 
technique used was Stratified Proportional Random Sampling. The total population was 2766, and the final sample 
obtained was 346 samples. The analysis tool used is path analysis using SPSS version 25.0 software. The results 
showed that among the variables that became the indicators of this study. The variable of government's role had the 
highest significance value concerning community behaviour, dental and oral health, and the relationship through 
intervening variables (community behaviour) in the Work Area of PHC Lara Karossa District, Middle Mamuju. On 
the other hand, variables with nominal values are shown in health educators' influence, both with community 
behaviour, oral health, and the relationship through intervening variables (community behaviour) in the Lara Public 
Health Center Work Area Karossa District, Middle Mamuju. Thus, the government's role has a more significant 
influence on public action and oral health because it is considered the dependent variable directly and indirectly. 
Meanwhile, health educators' variable needs to be improved with the ability of extension workers to encourage and 
convince the public and the world of health at large.

1. Introduction 
In theory, wellness is a resource for HR coaching and development (Human Resources). It can be used as capital to 
introduce a national development program, which can then be viewed as the development of the entire Indonesian 
population. Globalization and information technologies will undoubtedly overtake society in human life, according to 
John Naisbith's book Seven Waves of Life, which contains it. In Indonesia, health concerns emerge due to a lack of 
capacity, education, and preparation among health workers and a lack of experience among midwives. One of their

3622","The facts in place show that training (X2) has a negligible influence on midwife performance with greater t-count 
compared to t-table (8,440≥ 1,995) and P= 0.040 ≥ 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0, 312, the coefficient indicates 
that the better and higher the level of midwife training, the better and higher the resulting performance.  
 
The work environment variables are measured by seven indicators, namely lighting, work equipment, workplace, 
communication equipment, workspace, distance of health facilities, and cooperation. According to table 4.3, the 
respondent's answer to work environment variables can be understood when the respondent gives good value.  This 
can be seen from the number of deals, and the average reaches 4.36. Thus, a good work environment can help the 
performance of midwives. Therefore, the dominant indicator in the working environment variable is lighting (X3.1), 
with an average of 4.60. 
 
Answering the problem formulation and the first hypothesis can be observed from path analysis results in tael 4.7. the 
table shows the work environment has a significant influence on employees' quality of work. The findings of this 
study show that the work environment has a substantial effect on midwives' performance. This is due to the lack of 
air circulation, room arrangement, low pollution levels, and lack of lighting (lighting lights) will greatly affect the 
work situation. As stated by Hamsah in Nurimansah (2002:28), this finding is that a comfortable working environment 
has a significant impact on performance. The smooth circulation of the air, the arrangement of a well-appointed room, 
the beauty of pollution levels, and the presence of good lighting are the characteristics of the work environment that 
will improve performance. In other words, it can be highlighted that a conducive work environment provides facilities 
or facilities for employees to work effectively and efficiently, which will subsequently result in better performance. 
 
The research place shows that the work environment in Bulukumba district health center can improve midwife work 
quality. Considering the excellent working environment at the Bulukumba District Health Center will impact the 
completion of the work of the relevant agencies. Working environment conditions significantly affect job satisfaction 
or quality of service. A work environment is a place or process where the midwife performs her duties. A comfortable 
work environment is undoubtedly able to make each comfortable in work and raise the spirit in working.  The work 
environment symbolized by X3 evidence directly impacts the performance of midwives with t-count has a more 
significant number compared to t-table (7699≥ 1,995) and P = 0.00 ≤ 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0.915. The 
coefficient can show that the more adequate the work environment, the better the midwives' quality and performance 
results. 
 
Based on the research results, variables that are very or have a dominant influence on midwives' performance, mainly 
in the Bulukumba district, are an unstable work environment. This can be proven and seen from the most significant 
standardized coefficient (beta) of 0.663. Thus, the performance of midwives in Bulukumba District is strongly 
influenced by the work environment. It shows that there are an excellent working atmosphere and conducive of course, 
the performance of midwives will undoubtedly increase by the quality, quantity, professionalism, and targets to be 
achieved. The work environment is an aspect of facilities and infrastructure that must be appropriate so that later the 
behavior and responsibilities of midwives will be created. This is evidenced by the work environment symbolized as 
X3 directly impacting midwives showing t-count must have a more significant number than t-table (7699≥ 1,995) and 
P = 0.00 ≤ 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0.915. The coefficient can show that the more adequate the work 
environment, the better the midwives' quality and performance results. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Experience on the performance of village midwives has more influence in the variable experience is the indicator of 
long work (X1.1) with an average of 4.50. The respondents' characteristics found midwives with a working period of 
fewer than two years is 19.23% or frequency of 15≤4≤6 years of 33.33% or frequency of 26, and ≥6 years of 47.43% 
or frequency of 37. Training on the performance of village midwives has a negligible influence on midwife 
performance with greater t-count compared to t-table (8,440≥ 1,995) and P= 0.040 ≥ 0.05 with a coefficient value of 
0, 312, the coefficient indicates that the better and higher the level of midwife training, the better and higher the 
resulting performance. The work environment on the performance of village midwives has a more significant number 
compared to t-table (7699≥ 1,995) and P = 0.00 ≤ 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0.915. The coefficient can show 
that the more adequate the work environment, the better the midwives' quality and performance results. Dominant 
variables to midwife performance evidenced by the work environment symbolized as X3 directly impacting midwives 
showing t-count must have a more significant number than t-table (7699≥ 1,995) and P = 0.00 ≤ 0.05 with a coefficient

1. Introduction 
Financial or leasing companies are one of the principal loans options for acquiring property. Rent is in demand 
because it becomes a priority for consumers to get a loan financing solution if the instalments are competitive and 
the terms are easy, and the process is fast. Intense competition and the straightforward nature of loan repayment 
make the financing company become a customer or because there are human resource problems in the company's 
body, not only caused by negligence but also caused by irregularities or fraud committed by the company's 
employees. 
 
Along with the economic development in Indonesia, the company also developed. With the product that is 
growing, the problems that we will face will be more complex. Today, many rental companies face various issues, 
one of which involves fraud or fraud. All organizations and all their activities are at risk of fraud governance 
related to fraud in the company. One of the problems faced by financial companies here is the increasing sales.

1. Introduction 
Human resources in the organization today are a means of production and a driving force and determinant of the 
organization's activities. Human resources (HR) have a significant role in determining the progress or development of 
an organization. Therefore, the organization's progress is also determined by the quality and capabilities of the human 
resources in it. The more quality the human resources the organization has, the better the performance produced by 
HR at work. Every organization needs to increase its human resources so that the resulting performance increases 
because a progressive organization is an organization that displays good performance.

3631","This study's results align with Allen and Meyer's (2013) statement, defining commitment as a relative strength of an 
individual in his identity and involvement in the organization. Three things can characterize this attitude: a firm belief 
about an organization that accommodates, is severe in the organization's interests, and a strong desire to maintain 
membership in the organization.

increase in organizational commitment will be followed by an improvement in corporate culture, assuming other 
factors that affect organizational commitment are considered constant. This study shows that there is a positive and 
significant effect of organizational commitment on organizational culture. This can be seen from the direct influence 
path analysis; it is found that organizational commitment has a positive and significant effect on corporate culture. 
This study's results align with Allen and Meyer's (2013) statement, defining commitment as a relative strength of an 
individual in his identity and involvement in the organization. Three things can characterize this attitude: a firm belief 
about an organization that accommodates, is severe in the organization's interests, and a strong desire to maintain 
membership in the organization. The basic organizational philosophy contains shared beliefs, norms, and values which 
are the core characteristics of how to do things in the organization. 
 
5.3. The Influence of Appreciation and reprimands/sanctions on Organizational Culture 
The influence of reward and reprimand/sanction variables on organizational culture is positive. This means that an 
increase in respect and reprimand/sanction will be followed by an improvement in the corporate culture, assuming 
that other factors affect the reward's size. The reprimands/sanctions are considered constant. This research shows a 
positive and significant effect of appreciation and reprimand/sanction on organizational culture. This can be seen from 
the results of the analysis of the direct influence path; it is found that the results of rewards and admonitions/sanctions 
have a positive and significant effect on organizational culture. 
 
This study's results are in line with Luthans's (2006) statement, which states that organizations reward employees for 
motivating their performance and encouraging loyalty. According to Mangkunegara (2011), punishment is a threat of 
punishment from organizations that aim to improve offender employees' performance, maintain applicable 
regulations, and provide lessons to offenders"". 
 
5.4. The Effect of Organizational Commitment on Employee Performance 
The influence of the organizational commitment variable on employee performance is positive. This means that an 
increase in organizational commitment will be followed by an improvement in employee performance, assuming other 
factors that affect the size of organizational commitment are considered constant. This study shows that there is a 
positive and significant effect of organizational commitment on employee performance. This can be seen from the 
results of the direct influence path analysis; it is found that the results of organizational commitment have a positive 
and significant effect on employee performance. This study's products are also by the research of Abdullah Adri 
(2017); the conclusion obtained is that organizational commitment has a positive and significant effect on employee 
performance. Then a study conducted by Arina Nurandini (2014), the judgment obtained is that organizational 
commitment has a positive and significant impact on employee performance. 
 
The results of this study are in line with Bernardin's statement (in Robbins and Judge, 2013), the performance can be 
said to be good if the employee has work commitment, the level at which the employee has a work commitment to 
the agency, and the employee's responsibility to the office. According to Handoko (2012), one factor that influences 
performance is a commitment to the organization.

1. Introduction 
In facing competition in the global era, hospitals are required to work more efficiently and effectively. Along with the 
hospital's development, the battle between hospitals is getting more rigorous and very tight. The hospital is obliged to 
maintain and improve the hospital's continuity in terms of quality in service in the hospital.

3640","The results of hypothesis testing show that compensation has a positive and significant effect on the increase in the 
workforce of health workers in RSUD Haji Makassar City. This can be seen by using path analysis, namely βX1 = 
0.453 with the probability level (sig) of compensation is 0.000 (p <0.05). The results of hypothesis testing show that 
education and training have a positive and significant effect on the increase in the workforce of health workers at the 
Makassar City Hajj Hospital. This can be seen by using path analysis, namely βX2 = 0.373 with a probability level 
(sig) of 0.000 (p <0.05). 
The results of hypothesis testing show that compensation has a positive and significant effect on the increase in the 
workforce of health workers in RSUD Haji Makassar City. This can be seen by using path analysis, namely βY1 = 
0.138 with a probability level (sig) of work capability is 0.048 (p <0, 05). The results of hypothesis testing show that 
compensation has a positive and significant effect on the increase in the workforce of health workers at Haji Hospital 
Makassar City. This can be seen using the multiple linear regression test results for path coefficient model II (Path 
Analysis), which is guided by the t table, namely, 1.656, and the t-count is obtained from the Sobel test received 7,282. 
This explains that t-count > t-table or 7.282> 1.656, so the conclusion is that the sixth hypothesis shows that 
""Compensation has a positive and significant effect on performance through the work capabilities of health workers 
in RSUD Haji Makassar City, which is accepted and proven."" This shows that if compensation is appropriate following 
employee expectations, employees' work capability will also increase. The performance of health workers at the 
Makassar City Hajj Hospital will improve. 
 
5. Discussion 
The result of work in quality and quantity achieved by an employee in carrying out his duties following the 
responsibilities assigned to him is referred to as performance or work performance—factors influencing performance 
achievement, namely the ability factor (ability) and motivation factor (motivation). Employee abilities are divided 
into two categories: potential powers and reality abilities. This means that employees with above-average potential, 
adequate education for their positions, and skill in performing daily tasks will find it easier to meet expectations. The 
attitude of an employee in dealing with work situations determines the motivation factor. Motivation is a condition 
that drives employees to achieve organizational goals. 
Performance is a measure of healthcare success that demonstrates the accountability of service institutions within 
good governance. The main business in health services is various service levels and patient care, and nursing services 
are mainstream along the continuum of care. Nurses typically initiate efforts to improve the quality and performance 
of clinical services through various activities such as quality control groups, the application of nursing standards, 
problem-solving approaches, and nursing audits. 
The experience of patients and the community with the services they receive, according to Berwick (2001), is the most 
crucial link that needs to be considered in enhancing the quality and performance of health services. Meanwhile, 
according to WHO (2002), Performance Management development is a process improvement strategy in 
microsystems that supports and develops nurses' and midwives' clinical competence to perform professionally while 
paying attention to ethics, values, and legal elements in health services. It attempts to improve nurses' and midwives' 
clinical performance by clarifying roles and tasks, professional development and shared learning. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A quality health service approach can ensure that health care organizations always produce quality health services, 
that is, health services that comply with patients' expectations and needs. The use of a health service quality approach 
will increase the efficiency of health care organizations. The use of a quality health service approach will make health 
care organizations respected, well-known, and always sought after by everyone in need of excellent health care and a 
pleasant place to work for health workers. The adoption of the health service quality approach will primarily focus on 
the output of health services. Therefore it must complete each work correctly for health services to be precious to 
patients. The health service quality strategy will promote job satisfaction, commitment, and morale in the health care 
profession, ultimately leading to patient satisfaction.

3035","Furthermore, to determine the value of e1 can be reached by using the formula e1 = ƴ (1 - 0.435) = 0.565. Through 
path analysis test path, I where Y1=α0+α1X1+α2X2+e1 means Y1 = 0.000 + 0.422. X1 + 0.333. X2 + e1 is shown 
that if X1 (Professional competency educator) increases by one, then Y1 (completeness of learning device) also 
increases, meaning positive influence. In other words, the more competent an educator is, the more complete the 
learning tools. Similarly, if X2 (learning infrastructure) has increased by one, then Y1 (completeness of learning 
devices) also increases, meaning there is a positive influence.  In other words, the more the infrastructure to make 
school learning devices, the more complete the learning tools of an educator. 
 
Coefficient of Line II: 
As opposed to Coefficient Line II's result in the ""coefficient,"" it is stated that all three variables have significance 
values. Namely X1 = 0.008, X2 = 0.000, and Y1 = 0.000. Where X1, X2, and Y1 < 0.05, these results indicate the 
meaning that the regression of X1, X2, and Y1 has a significant influence on Y2. The nominal value of R Square 
contained in the table ""model summary"" is 0.607. This means that the contribution of X1, X2, and Y1 to Y2 is 60.7 
%. Simultaneously, the remaining 39.3 % contributed to other variables not studied or not included in this study.

shown that if X1 (Professional competency of educators) has increased by 1 then Y2 (educator performance) also 
increases, meaning there is a positive influence. In other words, the more competent an educator is, the better the 
performance. Similarly, if X2 (learning infrastructure) increases by one, then Y2 (educator performance) also 
increases, meaning there is a positive influence. In other words, the more infrastructure for making school learning 
devices used, the better the performance of educators. Furthermore, if Y1 (completeness of learning devices) increases 
by 1, then Y2 (educator performance) also increases, meaning there is a positive influence. In other words, the more 
complete the learning tools that educators have, the better the performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The Professional Competency of Educators is good. It guarantees the availability or completeness of learning 
equipment well; The Learning Infrastructure is adequate. It leads to the fulfillment of the Completeness of Learning 
Equipment properly; When the Completeness of Learning Devices is fulfilled, it causes educator performance to be

Where the learning infrastructure is adequate, it causes educator performance to be good; When the Professional 
Competencies of Good Educators and the Completeness of Learning Tools Are Fulfilled together, it causes educators 
to be good; Adequate School Learning Infrastructure with Complete learning equipment is fulfilled together without 
giving a positive and significant influence that is not directly to educators' performance at the State High School 
Branch of Education Office Region I Makassar City. This is due to the lack or fewer educators who use the School 
Computer Laboratory in making learning devices compared to educators who use school computer laboratories. In 
other words, the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of school infrastructure by educators in making learning 
devices are still lacking.

1. Introduction 
Globalization presents several challenges related to human resource (HR) management. Every organization must have 
qualified and highly competitive human resources to be energy for the organization to compete with its competitors 
during increasingly dynamic changes. The demands of talented and competitive human resources are competing 
organizations' needs and their own customers' demands, primarily external customers. Currently, the organization's 
external customers face many alternative decision-making choices so that they have many options in determining 
which products and services are consumed. 
 
Human resource management is an essential element in the management function. If human resources are not managed 
properly, their effectiveness will decline more rapidly than other resources. Human resources have a more significant

Testing the sixth hypothesis shows that leadership positively and significantly affects work effectiveness through work 
discipline. This indicates that the direct effect value is 0.109 while the indirect effect is 0.206. This means that the 
value of the immediate impact is smaller than the value of the indirect impact. This shows that leadership's influence 
on employee work effectiveness through work motivation has a positive and significant effect. Based on this, if 
leadership is effective, employee work discipline will also increase, so that the work effectiveness of employees at the 
Soppeng Education and Culture Office will also increase. 
 
5. Discussion 
Leadership is regarded as a fundamental driving force for businesses to establish a new culture conducive to change. 
Many people believe that leadership is directly tied to an organization's success. Leaders in an organization have a 
disproportionate influence on the organization's success or failure. An organization's performance is a description of 
the leader's performance in managing the organization. A good leader will guide, persuade, and monitor others to 
carry out tasks following his directions to realize organizational goals. 
Managers' ability and leadership skills in direction are critical factors in their performance. The organization's ability 
to pick influential leaders will improve if it can identify the attributes connected with leadership. And, if the 
organization can discover effective leadership behaviours and strategies, it will accomplish personal effectiveness 
development in the organization. The ability of the leaders and their supporters demonstrates that human resources 
are vital in government since government activities are primarily dependent on the activities of the apparatus as 
members of government organizations. Then, based on the operations of the government machinery, its efficacy in 
achieving government objectives and efficiency in utilizing the resources at its disposal may be seen. This suggests 
that the leader's competence to manage resources is required to fulfil the company's goals or improve organizational 
performance. 
The quality of the leader is frequently seen as an essential aspect in the organization's success or failure, as well as the 
success or failure of an organization, both corporate and public focused, is usually recognized as the success or failure 
of the leader. The leader's job is so crucial that it has become a focus of interest for researchers in the field of 
organizational behaviour. Leaders are critical in developing and implementing corporate strategies. As a result, every 
leader is obligated to devote substantial attention to designing, mobilizing, and guiding all potential employees in their 
environment to realize the volume and workload oriented toward the goal. In addition, leaders must provide authentic 
coaching to employees to increase employee satisfaction and organizational commitment and promote high 
performance.

Abstract 
This research was conducted at the West Sulawesi Provincial Health Office with 161 employees. The 
desired precision was 95% (or a tolerable error rate of 5%), so the minimum sample size to be taken was 
115 respondents. Respondent status is Civil Servants and Employees contracted by the West Sulawesi 
Provincial Government. The sample was calculated using the Slovin formula. At the same time, the methods 
used in this research are interview and questionnaire/questionnaire. The use of interviews is intended to 
obtain initial data and aims to get more detailed information. The use of questionnaires is meant to obtain 
primary data from respondents as research subjects. This study indicates that internal factors that have a 
positive and significant effect on job satisfaction are competence as an independent variable and employee 
performance as an intervening variable. Meanwhile, internal factors that do not positively and significantly 
affect job satisfaction are compensation as independent variables and competence through employee 
performance and payment through employee performance, which are separate and intervening variables.

Based on the table above, it can be known that the hypothetical test results in this study are presented as follows: 
The results of hypothesis 1 in the table showed that the direct influence for infrastructure variables (X1) on employee 
performance (Y1) was visible at 0.246 and was positive with a significance of 0.000. Thus, the infrastructure is positive 
and significant to employees' performance, so that the first hypothesis (H1) is accepted. 
 
The results of hypothesis 2 of the table showed that the direct influence value for surveillance variables (X2) on 
employee performance (Y1) was 0.628 and was positive with a significance of 0.001. In other words, positive and 
significant supervision on employee performance so that the second hypothesis (H2) is accepted. 
 
The results of hypothesis 3 in the table showed that the direct influence value for infrastructure variables (X1) on the 
quality of public services (Y2) was visible at 0.525 and was positive with a significance of 0.012. Thus, the 
infrastructure is positive and significant on the quality of public services so that the third hypothesis (H3) is accepted. 
The results of hypothesis 4 in the table showed that the direct influence value for surveillance variables (X2) on the 
quality of public services (Y2) was visible at 0.229 and was positive with a significance of 0.069. Thus, supervision 
has a positive but insignificant influence on public services quality, so the fourth hypothesis (H4) is rejected. 
 
The results of hypothesis 5 in the table showed that the direct influence value for employee performance variables 
(Y1) on the quality of public services (Y2) was visible at 0.610 and was positive with a significance of 0.000. Thus, 
employees' performance is positive and significant on the quality of public services, so that the fifth hypothesis (H5) 
is accepted. 
 
The hypothesis 6 results show that the influence of infrastructure facilities (X1) on the quality of public services (Y2) 
through employee performance (Y1) obtained from the multiplication of the value of influence X1 to Y1 with the value 
of influence Y1 to Y2 produces an influence value of 0.150. Thus, the infrastructure is positive and significant on the 
quality of public services through employees' performance so that the sixth hypothesis (H6) is accepted. 
 
The hypothesis 7 results showed that the influence of supervision (X2) on quality of public services (Y2) through 
employee performance (Y1) obtained from multiplication between the value of influence X2 to Y1 with the value of 
influence Y1 to Y2 resulted in an influence value of 0.383. Thus, positive, and significant supervision on the quality of 
public services through employee performance so that the seventh hypothesis (H7) is accepted. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on these findings, researchers can conclude several things regarding employee performance and quality of 
public services. First, infrastructure and supervision facilities have a positive and significant effect on employee 
performance. Second, infrastructure has a positive and significant impact on the quality of public services, but the 
variable supervision does not positively affect public services quality. Third, the indirect influence provided by 
infrastructure and leadership through employee performance on public services' quality looks good. To maintain and 
improve the quality of public services, they must need infrastructure facilities, supervision, and employees' 
performance.

Abstract 
This study aimed to analyze the effect of the regional financial management system and intellectual capital 
on the quality of regional financial management through work capabilities in Mamuju Regency. This 
research is cross-sectional research with a quantitative approach. This study's location was carried out in 
Mamuju Regency, namely the Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency. The respondents are the 
Regional Financial and Asset Management Agency employees in Mamuju Regency, with a total sample of 
145 people using the saturated sample technique. Data analysis was performed using path analysis 
techniques. The study results prove that the regional financial management system and intellectual capital 
have a positive and significant effect on work capability in Mamuju Regency. Meanwhile, the quality of 
regional financial management is influenced not only by the regional financial management system and 
intellectual capital but also by work capability. This study's findings also prove that statistical work 
capability appears to play an essential role in mediating the significant influence of the regional financial 
management system and intellectual capital on the quality of regional financial management in the Mamuju 
Regency.

As the study results concluded, factors such as regional financial management systems and intellectual capital play 
an essential role in improving the quality of regional financial management either directly or indirectly through work 
capabilities. Therefore, based on these findings, the researchers suggest: 
1. Mamuju Regency government, especially in terms of the regional financial management system, needs to be 
given special treatment to present information free from errors. In this case, related to the information conveyed 
has been free from recording errors still needs to be more attention. Similarly, related to regional financial 
management, information free from miscalculation also needs to be further improved. The regional financial 
management system in the Mamuju District Financial and Asset Management Agency is much better. 
2. Furthermore, concerning intellectual capital, that structural capital is still rated the lowest by respondents. 
Intellectual capital in the Mamuju District Financial and Asset Management Agency is significantly related to the 
work's operational system. That is clearer and is sought to build a transparent work culture better so that employees 
work by the work culture in the Mamuju District Financial and Asset Management Agency. 
3. Besides, more research is needed primarily related to research on efforts to improve the quality of regional financial 
management, such as developing research by expanding the scope of research objects or developing other variables 
that seem to affect the quality of an area's financial management.

1. Introduction 
In Indonesia, the practice of temporary nursing is a process of professionalism in which developments and changes 
occur globally and locally. Often, the problem faced in the execution of treatment upbringing in this state is that there 
are still many nurses who have not performed nursing services according to nursing care standards. The 
implementation of nursing care is also not accompanied by complete documentation (Asmadi, 2008). 
 
Documenting nursing care is a record of the patient's response to implementing nursing care, systematically and 
structured as accountability for the patient's actions in carrying out nursing care using the approach of the nursing care

=> Y1 = 0.205 with P = 0.012, The effect of compensation variables on motivation X2 => Y1 = 0.212 with P = 0.010, 
The effect of motivation variables on documentation Y1 => Y2 = 0.279 with P = 0,000, Effect of knowledge variable 
on documentation X1 => Y2 = 0.647 with P = 0,000, Effect of compensation variable on documentation X2 => Y2 = 
0,191 with P = 0,000, Indirect Effect (Indirect effect or IE) is the influence of knowledge variables on documentation 
through motivation X1 => Y1 => Y2 = (0.205 x 0.279) = 0.057, Effect of compensation variables on documentation 
through motivation X2 => Y1 => Y2 = (0.212 x 0.279) = 0.059. Effect of Total (Total Effect) is the influence of 
knowledge variables on documentation through motivation X1 => Y1 => Y2 = (0.647 + 0.057) = 0.704, The effect of 
compensation variables on documentation through motivation X2 => Y1 => Y2 = (0.191 + 0.059)) = 0.250, Based on 
the results of the above calculation it is known that: The value of the direct influence of knowledge on documentation 
is greater than the indirect effect of knowledge on documentation through motivation. The value of the direct effect 
of compensation on documentation is greater than the indirect effect of compensation on documentation through 
motivation. 
 
Hypothesis test stage that is direct there is a significant influence of knowledge (X1) on motivation (Y1) from the 
analysis obtained a significant value of 0.012 <0.05. Directly there is a significant effect of compensation (X2) on 
motivation (Y1) from the analysis obtained a significant value of 0.010 < 0.05. Directly there is a significant influence 
of knowledge (X1) on Documentation (Y2) from the analysis obtained a significant value of 0,000 <0.05. There is a 
significant direct effect of compensation (X2) on Documentation (Y2) from the analysis obtained a significant value 
of 0,000 <0.05. Directly there is a significant influence of Motivation (Y1) on Documentation (Y1) from the analysis 
obtained a significant value of motivation (Y1) of 0,000 <0.05. The direct effect of knowledge (X1) on Documentation 
(Y2) is 0.647, while the indirect effect of knowledge (X1) through motivation (Y1) on Documentation (Y2) is: 0.647 
x 0.279 = 0.181. Then the total effect given is the direct effect plus the indirect effect, namely: 0.647 + 0.181 = 0.828. 
The direct effect of compensation (X2) on Documentation (Y2) was 0.191, while the indirect effect of compensation 
(X2) through motivation (Y1) on Documentation (Y2) was: 0.191 x 0.279 = 0.053. Then the total effect given is the 
direct effect plus the indirect effect, namely: 0.191 + 0.053 = 0.244.

5. Discussion 
This study is not by previous research Kusdyah (, 2012); the results of his research showed that prices have a positive 
effect on the perception of Nilai, prices will be in a good group, especially if the price indicator can be equivalent to 
the service obtained by customers. Before using a product or before getting service, customers will review whether 
the advantages and benefits of service have been equal to the predetermined price.  If the price is very high, the 
company is also considered indifferent to customers. Andis is judged to have committed fraud to customers. Similarly, 
if the price is too low, customers will even. Doubt a product in terms of the quality of service in a company. So, it can 
be concluded that the price is assessed and seen with the money that the customer must pay to get/consume an item 
and get services/services. As well as the customer knows that the price obtained is equivalent to the quality. 
This research is also following previous research by Budiyanto (2014) that there is a significant influence between the 
quality of service and facilities to customers' satisfaction in using the services of Narita Hotel Surabaya. So, it can be 
concluded that the facility must exist in the company before being offered a subscription. Interior and exterior design 
and cleanliness of the facilities must be maintained, especially concerning what is felt directly by the customer. This 
research is also in line with the results of a previous study by Budiyanto (2014) that there is a significant influence 
between facilities to customer satisfaction in using Narita Hotel Surabaya's services. So, it can be concluded that the 
facility is a must-have in the company before being offered a subscription. Interior and exterior design and cleanliness 
for facilities must also be very maintained, especially those directly related to customer satisfaction. 
This research is also in line with the results of previous research Budiyanto (2014); the research results showed the 
quality of service in a personal and simultaneous positive and significant effect on customer satisfaction PT. Sucofindo 
Batam. So, it can be concluded that good service quality will positively impact the company because it will be a loyal 
customer and provide good feedback for the company. This is also following previous research, Kartika research 
(2011). This study shows that the quality of services, prices, and facilities have a positive and significant influence on 
patient satisfaction at the clinic As Syifa Bekasi. So that between the facilities, customer satisfaction and the quality 
of service are interrelated. This shows that before feeling the product/service, consumers will first see whether benefits 
can provide customer satisfaction.

Abstract 
The implementation of PHBS in households is the responsibility of each household member, which is also 
the responsibility of the government/city and the ranks of the relevant sectors to facilitate PHBS activities 
in households to be carried out effectively. In the home, the mother has a massive role in giving an example, 
role model, education in a family. Mothers also dominate in regulating food menus and keeping the house 
clean, including providing health education in the family, such as planting PHBS. The study was designed 
in the form of qualitative research with an in-depth interview approach. The informants in this research 
were 12 people consisting of 5 key informants and seven regular informants. The interview guide was built 
based on ten indicators of PHBS at the household level. All indicators of PHBS at the household level have 
been successfully elaborated. Interestingly, in this study, some informants give breast milk for less than six 
months. Then what is interesting is the habit of consuming fruits and vegetables from local fruits and 
vegetables. Smoking behavior has become part of the culture of Mandar society.

3098","5. Discussion 
According to the Ministry of Health RI, Health Promotion Center in 2007, indicators of clean and healthy living 
behavior at the household level, there are ten dimensions of clean and healthy living habits at household level, namely: 
(1) delivery assisted by health personnel (2) exclusive breastfeeding, (3) weighing children under five (4) washing 
hands with clean water (5) using clean water (6) using latrines when defecating (7) eradicating mosquito nests (8) 
consuming fruits and vegetables (9) doing physical activities and (10) not smoking. Clean and healthy living behavior 
(PHBS) is a form of manifestation of a healthy paradigm in a healthy-oriented individual, family, and community 
culture to improve, maintain, and protect physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. Besides, the clean and healthy 
lifestyle program aims to provide learning experiences and create conditions for individuals, groups, families, 
communities through opening communication channels, information, and education. It aims to increase knowledge, 
attitudes, and behavior so that people are aware, willing, and able to practice—clean and healthy lifestyle. Based on 
the above relationships, the following indicators can be made. 
 
Clean water is a basic need that affects public health. Clean water is used for drinking, bathing, washing, and so on. 
Contaminated water can be a source of the spread of many diseases—for example, diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery. 
The latrine is a critical sanitation facility and includes a clean and healthy lifestyle. This is because the restroom is 
related to human waste's safe disposal, does not pollute the environment, and does not spread disease. Mosquitoes are 
among the deadliest animals globally, and their eradication includes clean and healthy living habits in the household. 
The reason is that these animals can be carriers and spreaders of various diseases. Clean water in the house and around 
the residence must be cleaned frequently. Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These 
nutrients are needed by the body to function optimally and stay healthy. Therefore, combine fruit and vegetables into 
your daily menu. Enrich the color of the fruits and vegetables that you eat so that the nutrients that enter the body are 
also complete. 
 
Physical activity in the form of sports activities should be done for at least 30 minutes every day. You also do not need 
to choose a complicated sport. You do simple physical activity—for example, walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming. 
Smoking habits can be the cause of various health problems. They were starting from lung and respiratory disease, 
cardiovascular disease, to cancer. In addition to detrimental to active smokers' health, people around the smoker, aka 
passive smokers, are also at risk of health problems if they are constantly exposed to toxic cigarette smoke. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Banggai Community Health Center's research results found that the person who helped deliveries were health 
workers, namely midwives at the Puskesmas. The TBA is only for delivery to the place of delivery and the baby's care 
after delivery. Exclusive breastfeeding has been implemented even though some have given it for less than six months 
because the breastfeeding stops suddenly. They weighed babies and toddlers every month at the Posyandu during the 
pandemic by visiting them in their respective homes. It can be obtained from dug wells for clean water, from PDAM, 
and some buy water to be drunk directly without being boiled. Informants always keep themselves clean by washing 
their hands using clean water and soap, especially during the Covid-19 period. Some people do not have family 
restrooms, and there are still informants who defecate in the sea because it has become a habit. The larvae problem at 
the household level is not a problem because it is always cleaned every day. 
This is good information to get in the habit of consuming locally grown fruit. The tradition of walking after prayer is 
also a good reference. However, smoking as part of the Mandar people's culture is a unique thing that needs further 
research.

Abstract 
This study's expected objective is to determine and analyze the effect of education and training and work 
facilities on employee performance through workability in South Sulawesi province's human resource 
development agency. This study uses a causal research design that shows a causality or a cause-and-effect 
relationship between the variables studied and uses a quantitative approach. In this study, the population 
was 130 employees in the Human Resources Development Agency of South Sulawesi Province. Sampling 
using purposive sampling technique, the final sample used was 130 people. Data collection was carried out 
through observation, questionnaires, interviews, and documentation. Analysis of the data in this study with 
multiple linear regression and processing using SPSS ver. 25. The research shows that education and 
training through employees' workability positively but significantly affect employee performance, which is 
4.2%. In contrast, work facilities through employee workability have a dominant influence on employee 
performance, namely 70.2%. All the hypotheses proposed in this study can be accepted. The 
implementation of education and training for workability shows that training activities provide additional 
technical and functional knowledge. They are also given the cultivation of essential values and character 
building. Employees will be more enthusiastic and motivated to work if they are facilitated with adequate 
work facilities. Through good work facilities, they can work more independently and hone their abilities 
and skills to complete a job.

1. Introduction 
Management activities generally take the form of efforts to achieve organizational goals by utilizing existing 
resources. One crucial resource and requires more attention in supporting administrative operations is human resources 
humans who run and become actors in every company activity (Ambar, 2003). Along with its development, all 
organizations are required to be able to compete in providing full service, including government organizations the

and support their work to work better and independent. 
 
The magnitude of the influence is 0.175 with a significance value of 0.006. The WorkAbility variable (Y1) on 
Employee Performance (Y2) is positive and significant. This means that the increase in the WorkAbility variable will 
increase the employee performance increase by assuming that other factors that influence the size and smallness of 
the Work Ability are constant. The results of this study are in line with this research by Kiki Rindy Arini et al. (2015), 
Soeharto (2004), and Aprina Wardani (2017), which show a positive and significant influence on workability on 
employee performance. The increasing integrity values of employees show the effect of workability on employee 
performance in carrying out their duties. Employees with the ability to work have encouraged themselves to be able 
to do their job optimally. This is shown by the increasing level of discipline, work commitment, integrity, service 
levels, and even solid cooperation. 
 
The magnitude of the influence is 0.103. The effect of the Education and Training (Y1) variable on Employee 
Performance (Y2) through Work Ability (Y1) is positive and significant. This means that an increase in the Education 
and Training variable will increase Employee Performance through workability by assuming that other factors are 
involved. Affect the size and size of Education and Training are constant. The implementation of Education and 
Training has shown a positive impact on improving employee performance, even though not all of Education and 
Training implementation can form good character to high-performance employees' performance. 
 
The magnitude of the influence is 0.763. The effect of the Work Facility variable (X2) on Employee Performance 
(Y2) through Work Ability (Y1) is positive and significant. This means that an increase or increase in Work Facilities 
will increase Employee Performance improvement through workability by assuming that other factors that affect the 
size and size of the work facility are constant. The most significant influence that underlies the increase in employee 
performance in the Human Resources Development Agency of South Sulawesi Province is work facilities. Work 
facilities are supporting facilities capable of encouraging maximum performance achievement of employees. This 
significant influence is because employees prefer to work independently by utilizing adequate work facilities. The 
Human Resources Development Agency of South Sulawesi Province, with its facilities such as computers, buildings, 
parking lots, and transportation routes, has encouraged employees to work optimally and achieve good performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The guidance carried out by BPSDM of South Sulawesi Province leads to efforts to increase: Attitude and spirit of 
dedication oriented towards the interests of public/society of the nation, state, and homeland; Technical competence 
in managerial and leadership; Efficiency and effectiveness, and quality in implementing tasks carried out with a spirit 
of cooperation and responsibility following the facilities and work capabilities. 
 
The implementation of education and training on workability shows that training activities provide additional 
knowledge, both technical and functional. Still, they are also given the planting of essential values and character 
building, which will later affect implementing their daily duties obligations a state servant. Apart from education and 
training, adequate and adequate work facilities will directly significantly impact the performance of employees within 
the Human Resources Development Agency of South Sulawesi Province. The work facility variable as the variable 
with the highest level of influence compared to other variables shows that employees will be more enthusiastic and 
motivated to work if they are facilitated with adequate work facilities. Through good work facilities, they can work 
more independently and hone their abilities and skills to complete a job. Besides, employees of the South Sulawesi 
Province Human Resource Development Agency's daily activities instil important organizational values, 
strengthening the emotional relationship between employees and corporate matters. Employees have a commitment 
to work, not just carrying out work routines, but there are targets to be achieved that can satisfy them at work.

1. Introduction 
Human resources, commonly referred to as employees, play an important role in a company, where employees play a 
role in advancing all work activities. Therefore, the company's human resources must be appropriately managed to 
achieve the company's desired goals. In the current era of globalization, it requires high competitiveness, meaning that 
companies do not need to spend energy to innovate so that human resources in the company must be more productive 
and better over time (Nuria, 2017).

3114","Multiple regression data management carried out in this study provides the result that time management has a positive 
and significant effect on the teaching staff's employee performance at the STIKES Pelamonia Makassar campus. The 
direct relationship between the time management variable (Y1) on employee performance (Y3) is 0.371, with a 
significant degree of 0.027 less than 0.05. So, it is assumed that the fourth hypothesis is accepted. Therefore, it is to 
improve employees' performance in the teaching staff at the Stikes Pelamonia Makassar campus. Always take steps 
that are deemed to be able to create the right policies to provide space for employees in work involvement and foster 
time management to improve the performance that is needed by the campus. 
 
Based on the tests that have been done, the multiple regression data management conducted in this study shows that 
time management has a positive and significant effect on the teaching staff's employee performance at the STIKES 
Pelamonia Makassar campus. The indirect relationship between workload variables (X) on employee performance 
(Y3) through time management variables (Y1) using the formulation Y3 = (XY1 x Y1Y3) + XY3 = (0.589 x 0.371) 
+ 0.307. The real relationship that occurs between the workload variable (X) and the employee performance variable 
(Y3) through the time management variable (Y1) is 0.218 or 0.218 + 0.307 = 0.525. It can be assumed that the sixth 
hypothesis is accepted. 
 
Multiple regression data management carried out in this study provides the result that job stress has a positive and 
significant effect on the teaching staff's employee performance at the STIKES Pelamonia Makassar campus. The 
indirect relationship between the workload variable (X) on employee performance (Y3) through the work stress 
variable (Y2) using the formulation Y3 = (XY2 x Y2Y3) + XY3 = (0.082 x 0.234) + 0.307. The real relationship that 
occurs between the workload variable (X) and the employee performance variable (Y3) through work stress (Y2) is 
0.019 or 0.019 + 0.307 = 0.326. It can be assumed that the seventh hypothesis is accepted. 
 
6. Conclusion 
It can be concluded for a direct relationship that if the workload is increased positively, it will improve time 
management. If the workload is increased will increase work stress. Likewise, if the workload has decreased, it will 
result in a decrease in work stress. If the workload is raised positively, it will increase employee performance. 
Likewise, if the workload has decreased, it will result in a decrease in employee performance. If time management is 
improved positively, it will improve employee performance. Likewise, if time management has decreased, it will 
result in a decrease in employee performance. If work stress has reduced, it will reduce employee performance. Vice 
versa, and if the work stress has increased, it will improve employee performance. An indirect relationship, if the 
workload through time management is increased positively, will improve employee performance. Likewise, if the 
workload and time management have decreased, it will decrease employee performance. If the workload has increased, 
it will increase work stress and will improve employee performance. Likewise, if the workload and work stress have 
decreased, it will decrease employee performance.

Abstract 
This study aimed to determine the effect of the work environment and certification allowances on teacher 
pedagogical abilities, the work environment's impact, and certification allowances on student achievement. 
This type of research is post facto and is a quantitative study. We used a path analysis model, descriptive 
correlational, and data collection through a questionnaire in the form of a questionnaire. This research was 
carried out in the formal education in four SMAN 1 regional education office schools in Makassar. The 
number of samples is 120 teachers who have been certified. The results showed that: (1) the work 
environment had a positive and significant effect on teacher pedagogical abilities, (2) certification 
allowances had a positive and significant impact on teacher pedagogical skills, (3) the work environment 
had no significant or insignificant effect on student achievement and (4) certification allowances had a 
positive and significant impact on student achievement.

1. Introduction 
Education is a process of intellectual and psychological development covering all aspects of life, including cultural 
elements (ethics, morals, traits, and skills following the community environment and national development culture. 
Thus, education is a conscious and planned effort to prepare students through guidance activities, teaching, and 
training for its future role. 
 
According to the National Education System Law (UUSPN), number 20 of 2003, an education unit is an educational 
service group that provides formal, non-formal, and informal education that complements each other at each level and

student achievement (Y2) with the perception that other indicators affect student achievement (Y2) and is considered 
constant. The beta statistical value of the coefficient of the effect of certification allowances (X2) on student 
achievement (Y2) is = 0.353, the significance of 0.000 is below 0.01 or 1%. It means that the certification allowance 
(X2) has a positive and significant effect on student achievement (Y2). Hypothesis 4 is the certification allowance has 
a positive and significant impact on student's triumph in the formal education unit task force of the SMAN education 
office region 1 Makassar, proven. 
 
This means that an increase will follow an increase in the certification allowance in student achievement because there 
are other influential indicators. This can be seen in the path analysis used; namely, certification allowances on student 
achievement have a natural or significant impact. This shows that the certification allowance increases students' 
achievement at the UPT formal education unit of SMAN in the regional education office branch of Makassar. 
 
These findings are in line with Suyatno (2008), which states that one of the certification objectives is to determine the 
appropriate nature of a teacher in carrying out duties as a learning agent in realizing national learning objectives and 
teacher dignity in achieving quality and educational outcomes and improving professionalism. The government strives 
to improve the quality of teaching staff by providing certification allowances. Of course, everything is closely related 
to the output of the teaching and learning process, namely, students' achievement. According to the 2007 Minister of 
National Education Regulation No. 18, the certification allowance's implication states that certification intended for 
teachers in the office is carried out through a competency test. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on this study's results, it can conclude that several variables have a positive and significant effect. The influence 
of the work environment and teacher certification allowances on teacher pedagogy and the impact of certification 
allowances on student achievement, especially the South Sulawesi provincial government, requires certification. 
Teacher pedagogical competence is continuously improved to achieve optimal teacher performance. While the 
variable that does not affect the certification allowance on student achievement.  
This means that the work environment does not fully guarantee the achievement of students. It is necessary to review 
policies from social, physical, and non-physical work environment indicators to impact and contribute to improving 
learning process services in schools whose output increases student achievement according to national standards.

1. Introduction 
The midwife is a pioneer in health development and an advocate for community health services but can also be an

3134","The study results are in line with research (Triyanto & Sudarwati, 2014), concluding that competence influences 
employee motivation. Furthermore, research (Solehudin) & Yusuf, 2018) concluded that there is an influence of 
competence on employee motivation. The influence of the discipline variable on work motivation is positive, meaning 
that an increase in discipline is followed by an improvement in work motivation, assuming that other factors are 
considered constant. This research is in line with research (Serly Herliantini, 2016), which concludes that there is an 
effect of work discipline on work motivation. Parinduri et al., 2017) concluded that the field has a significant impact 
on work motivation. Also, (Hasibuan 2011) stated that the purpose of reason is to create conducive and good working 
conditions and relationships, increase responsibility for work and increase work discipline. 
 
The effect of midwife competence on work productivity is positive. An increase in midwife competence will be 
followed by improved work productivity, assuming other factors are considered constant. This research is in line with 
(Ramdhan & Tackbir Abubakar, 2018), which concludes that employee competence influences work productivity. 
Furthermore, research (Nuryanto, Murakhman Sayuti Enggok, & Abdurrahman, 2017) concluded that competence 
has a significant effect on work productivity. 
 
The effect of discipline on work productivity is positive, meaning that increased field is followed by improvements in 
work productivity, assuming other influencing factors are considered constant. This study is in line with research 
(Widyaningsih & Nesty, 2013) that work discipline has a significant positive effect on work productivity. Furthermore, 
Ismanto's research, Nano (2014), states that there is an effect of punishment on employee work productivity. This 
study's results are also in line with the view (Sinungan & Muchdarsyah, 2014) that one of the factors that can affect 
work productivity is work discipline, such as obedience, obedience, and awareness of the regulations of the institution 
or organization. Work discipline can make work quickly completed. Then (Nawawi 2011) argued that morale could 
be defined as employees' mental attitude in doing their jobs; this attitude is shown through passion in carrying out 
tasks and encouraging themselves to work better and productively. 
 
This study shows a significant positive effect of midwife competence on work productivity through work motivation. 
This can be seen in the path analysis of the indirect impact of midwife competence through work motivation has a 
significant effect on work productivity; thus, work motivation can affect the competence of midwives on work 
productivity. The managerial implication of the influence of midwife competence on work productivity through work 
motivation is that work motivation provides a driving force that encourages midwives' work to cooperate. Work 
effectively and re-integrated with all abilities to achieve performance levels, influencing the competence with 
characteristics that include knowledge, behaviour, and skills that must be possessed in carrying out midwifery practice 
responsibly. 
 
This research shows that there is a significant positive effect of discipline on work productivity through work 
motivation. This can be seen in path analysis results; the indirect impact of the field through work motivation has a 
significant effect on work productivity. Thus, work motivation can influence discipline on work productivity. Work 
motivation on work productivity is positive, meaning that an increase in work motivation is followed by improved 
work productivity, assuming that other factors are considered constant. This research is in line with research (Yusnita, 
2011) that motivation positively affects work productivity. Furthermore, research (Widyaningsih & Nesty, 2013) 
states that work motivation positively influences work productivity. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The competence of midwives has a significant positive effect on work motivation at the Public Health Center at Central 
Mamuju Regency. Discipline has a significant positive effect on work motivation at the Public Health Center at Central 
Mamuju Regency. The competence of midwives has a significant positive effect on work productivity at the Public 
Health Center at Central Mamuju Regency. Discipline has a significant positive effect on work productivity at the 
Public Health Center at Central Mamuju Regency. Midwife competence has a significant positive effect on work 
productivity through work motivation at the Public Health Center at Central Mamuju Regency. Discipline has a 
significant positive effect on work productivity through work motivation at the Public Health Center at Central

1. Introduction 
Every agency or company is always trying to improve performance that will affect an agency or organization's 
development. To improve performance, it requires employees who have good performance. Suppose an employee 
carries out his duties according to the responsibilities assigned to him. In that case, the company can take various ways 
to improve employee performance to increase the agency's effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out activities and 
work that have been planned and programmed. This is because humans have the potential to be developed 
continuously in each of their work activities. However, without the support of good performance, an agency will not

Abstract 
This study aims to determine how much influence Soft Competence has on Intellectual Capital and Talent 
Management and its impact on Service Quality at Mega Bank Regional Makassar. This study uses a 
causality design with a quantitative approach and conducts at Mega Bank Regional Makassar. The study 
population was all employees, as many as 201 people. A simple random sampling method was used by 
distributing questionnaires out in stages. All respondents were able to complete the questionnaire with 
various factors experienced by respondents, including being sick, being outside the city, not returning 
according to the specified time, etc. Only 50% managed to return the questionnaire entirely and on time. 
Thus, the final sample included in this research was 100 people. The procedures for collecting information 
are monitoring, question and answer, questionnaires, and documentation. Analysis of information using 
path analysis with SPSS version 25.0 software. The results showed that the direct effect of soft competence 
on talent management gave the highest correlation value compared to other immediate products. Smooth 
competence possessed by Mega Bank Regional Makassar employees is considered a personal advantage 
that provides benefits in the organization with the ability to measure individual characteristics that make it 
easier for management to capture these potentials in increasing the achievement of organizational goals. 
The lowest correlation is shown in the direct influence of talent management on service quality at Mega 
Bank Regional Makassar and the indirect effect of soft competence and intellectual capital on service 
quality through talent management. Internal control in organizing work in each division does not involve 
an independent assessor. Not all the employees' ability to manage talent is considered good. Employees 
who have good performance that provides added value to the organization are still not appreciated.

3148","5. Discussion 
Positive and significant, reinforced by research by Fani Setiani and Rasto (2015), Sutrisno and Adjib Karjanto (2014) 
as well as and Ulfah Hidayati et al. (2015). Soft competence is shown well by employees, especially in communicating 
with seniority levels in banking institutions, especially at Bank Mega, requiring employees to share in stages. Besides 
that, thinking analytically and teamwork further encourages employees' maximum efforts in carrying out their duties 
properly. 
 
Positive and significant, supported by research Schiuma G., & Lerro A. (2008); Bontis, N. (2001); Wiig, K. (1997). 
Recruitment is carried out based on the qualifications as the principal capital being considered. The strong 
encouragement of employees generates added value for the company, awakens their self-confidence because their 
ability is excellent hope for Bank Mega Regional Makassar to continue to be developed. The consideration of 
efficiency goes well with the high appreciation of the institution for its employees. 
 
Positive and significant, supported by research by Anna Rokhayati et al. (2017) and Sudjarwanto (2016), Eny 
Kusmiran (2017), and Azwar V (2011). Soft competence of the Makassar Regional Mega Bank employees is shown 
by good communication factors that encourage positive responsiveness, besides solid teamwork as the central pillar 
of achieving the service quality level. 
 
Positive and significant, confirmed by the research of Snell, Scott A. (2004) Kong, E., & Prior, D. (2008) and Roos, 
G., & Roos, J. (1997); Widyaningdyah, (2013). Employees at various organizational levels at Bank Mega Regional 
Makassar are fully responsible for any actions that impact the quality of services provided. High intellectual values 
will be an important steppingstone in creating a good quality service. This service is not only for customer service but 
also for assistance in the organization. 
 
The result is not significant, contrary to the research findings of Nisa, Ridha Choirun, et al. (2016); Silvia, Kataike. 
(2013); and Aljunaibi, Mohamed Musallam (2014). The abilities or talents possessed have not been able to encourage 
the achievement of service quality. Internal management in organizing work in each division does not involve an 
independent assessor who can group employees based on their technical abilities but only looks at the level of 
experience they have done so far. 
 
Not significant, the Makassar Regional Bank Mega employees' soft competence is considered a personal advantage 
that can provide benefits in the organization. With this ability, the individual employee's character can be measured 
to make it easier for management to capture these potentials to increase the achievement of organizational goals. But 
on the other hand, not all the management's ability to manage these talents in the organization is considered reasonable 
by employees. There are still gaps in the placement of inappropriate positions, the feeling of dissatisfaction of other 
employees with the order of new employees who do not have much experience, which results in a decrease in the level 
of efficiency and work effectiveness of employees. 
 
Not significant, at Bank Mega Regional Makassar, the level of employees' intellectual ability is quite good. This is 
because educational qualifications support it following their fields. Understanding the world of banking is excellent 
and is the hope of the organization. However, having employees with good intellectual capital has not been in line 
with what the employees want. Talent management is considered a variable that is expected to coordinate all employee 
resources so that they can work comfortably and without any pressure. The essence of talent management is employees' 
placement in positions following their fields and optimism for employees to function optimally. However, employees' 
intellectual capital has not been able to improve the quality of the organization's services to them. Employees who 
have good performance that provides added value to the organization are still not appreciated. Even management can 
rotate positions based on work experience and not on employee performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on this study's findings, it can be concluded that of the seven proposed hypotheses, four are proven, and three 
are not. The direct influence of soft competence on talent management provides the highest correlation value. Smooth 
competence possessed by Bank Mega Regional Makassar employees is considered a personal advantage that offers 
benefits in the organization with the ability to measure individual characteristics that make it easier for management 
to capture these potentials to increase organizational goals. The lowest correlation is shown in the direct influence of 
talent management on service quality at Bank Mega Regional Makassar and the indirect effect of soft competence and

does not involve an independent assessor who can perform groupings based on ability. Still, only on the experience, 
he has done so far. The insignificant effect is also shown on the power of management to manage talent in the 
organization. Not all are considered reasonable by employees. There are still gaps in the placement of inappropriate 
positions, the feeling of dissatisfaction of other employees with the arrangement of new employees who do not have 
much experience, which decreases the level of efficiency and effectiveness of employees' work. The intellectual capital 
owned by employees has not improved the quality of the organization's services to them. Employees who have good 
performance that provides added value to the organization are still not appreciated. Even management can rotate 
positions based on work experience and not on the performance of their employees.

3155","6. Conclusion 
From the research results that have been carried out at the Makassar Main Harbourmaster Office, it can be concluded 
that education and training have a positive and significant effect on the Employee Team of the Makassar Main 
Harbourmaster office. The better the education and training, the more it will improve the Makassar Main 
Harbourmaster office's employee teamwork. Professionalism has a positive and significant effect on the Makassar 
Main Harbourmaster Employee Teamwork. The better the Professionalism, the better the Employee Teamwork of the 
Makassar Main Harbourmaster office. Education and training are not significant or have no significant effect on the 
Improvement of the Makassar Main Harbourmaster Office's Service Quality. Higher education and training will not 
have a substantial impact on the quality of services provided. Professionalism has a positive and significant effect on 
the Improvement of the Makassar Main Harbourmaster Office's Service Quality. 
 
The better is the Professionalism, the better is the service quality for the Makassar Main Harbourmaster Office 
employees. The Makassar Main Harbourmaster Employee Teamwork is not significant or has no significant effect on 
the Improvement of Service Quality at the Makassar Main Harbourmaster Office. The bigger the teamwork will not 
have a substantial impact on the quality of service provided. The direct effect of education and training on quality 
improvement is not significant. The immediate impact of Professionalism on improving service quality is positive and 
significant. Professionalism needs to be maintained because it has a natural impact on Teamwork Improvement and 
Service Quality at the Makassar Main Harbourmaster Office. Education and training have no biological or 
insignificant effect on teamwork and improving service quality due to Service SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), 
Service Technical Guidelines, and Integrity Facts. Which are references and core guidelines for employees have not 
been appropriately implemented. Education and training, and Professionalism have a strong correlation. Therefore, it 
can improve the quality of services for the better. It is hoped that the following research can focus on other variables 
that are considered to affect improving the service quality.

database of poverty alleviation programs with components of education, health, social welfare funds. In PKH, there 
is empowerment given to KPM, whose purpose is so that KPM can prosper independently when they are no longer 
PKH participants. PKH also organizes a Family Development Session program or Family Capacity Building Meeting

3681","respondents representing the total population between PKH facilitators and Beneficiary Families (KPM). This study 
can improve the welfare of the poor in empowerment through the Family Hope Program (PKH) and qualified 
companions according to indicators and direct interviews from respondents' representatives as informants in the study. 
 
6. Conclusions and suggestions 
Based on data analysis, which has been described regarding Improving the Welfare of the Poor with the quality of 
companions and the Hope Family Program's quality in Empowerment in Makassar City. The results can be concluded 
that: On the quality of PKH facilitators in improving welfare through empowerment, research results show that the 
products are categorized as sufficiently qualified. That is the quality of PKH assistants in helping improve the welfare 
of KPM through the Empowerment program in Makassar City. According to KPM, the Family Hope Program has 
been carried out regularly, actively, and optimally by the provisions in PKH general guidelines, namely holding 
monthly group meetings or Family Capacity Building Meetings (P2K2) motivation. However, the condition of reason 
has not been applied continuously. Beneficiary Families, as PKH participants, can increase their knowledge and 
experience from before after routinely attending meetings held by the companion. The desire to change the mindset 
and attitude, and behavior of PKH Beneficiary Families is like having a sense of responsibility in carrying out their 
obligations related to PKH. The quality of PKH facilitators in improving the welfare of beneficiary families in 
Makassar City has been implemented optimally based on mentoring tasks responsive to complaints or problems faced 
by PKH. Beneficiary families so that PKH beneficiary families feel that their family life is more prosperous than 
before because they feel helped by the assistance social PKH and Facilitators who care and want to listen to their 
complaints and problems. Family welfare can be shown by improving the quality of life of PKH beneficiary families 
from before because they feel helped and are light in fulfilling the needs of their family life. 
 
The explanation above can be concluded that the quality of the Family Hope Program Assistant in helping improve 
the welfare of beneficiary families through empowerment in Makassar City, PKH Facilitators have carried out their 
duties and roles to the fullest and change attitudes and behavior.  The economic independence of each PKH KPM, be 
further improved and prepare a suitable strategy so that PKH Beneficiary Families are no longer dependent on PKH 
assistance or feel comfortable with PKH social assistance. PKH Beneficiary Families must have independent attitudes 
and behaviors, especially in the economic field, such as having a Productive Economic Business (UEP) or Joint 
Business Group (KUBE). Either individually or in groups so that the Family of Hope Program's objectives can improve 
beneficiary families' welfare. 
After concluding the research results, the authors would like to provide the following suggestions: 
1. The Ministry of Social Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia can further optimize the current public policy that is 
the Hope Family Program by paying more attention to the Family Hope Program's targeted assistance. Whether it 
is appropriate and right on target to reduce poverty in Indonesia and pay more attention to quality and performance, 
one of the Family Hope Program's human resources is a companion to the Family Hope Program for the Harapan 
goals Family Program's success. 
2. Relevant agencies, especially the Social Service Office of Makassar City, can provide support in the form of 
facilities and operational costs and pay more attention to the performance of the Family Hope Program companion. 
They can carry out their duties optimally for the success of changing knowledge, attitudes, and independent 
behavior of PKH Beneficiary Families to further improve family welfare in society. 
3. For PKH Human Resources, especially the Family Hope Program Assistant of Makassar City. To be more 
responsible in carrying out their duties and obligations optimally based on the provisions of the program's general 
guidelines. They are mainly carrying out Family Capacity Building Meetings (P2K2) routine activities and 
motivating activities that are directly beneficial to improve skills and change attitudes, mindsets, and knowledge. 
And behavior so that later PKH beneficiary families have a prosperous life. They do not depend on social assistance 
programs, continuously hoping that they can improve their economy independently and get out of the chain of 
poverty in the future. 
4. For Beneficiary Families, as PKH Makassar City participants, must be diligent in attending activities carried out 
by the companion. Through family capacity-building meetings in which various knowledge is applied to 
Beneficiary Families and implemented in everyday life, they can change attitudes, mindsets, and independent 
behavior. According to the Family Hope Program's provisions, increasing skills and expertise, including those 
related to obligations and rights, so that family welfare can grow and be felt by beneficiary families in the future 
and do not continue to depend on PKH social assistance.

Abstract 
The high quality of human resources is expected to be able to improve services to the community. A 
conducive work environment will be created, among other things influenced by exemplary leadership. The 
research objective was to analyze the quality of services at the Public Housing and Settlement Services in 
Mamuju Tengah Regency and the factors that influence these services' quality. This study uses a 
quantitative descriptive approach with the Path Analysis method. The variables used in this study are the 
variable Leadership Style (X1), Work Environment (X2), Employee Performance (Y1), and Service Quality 
(Y2). The results showed that the leadership style and work environment positively and significantly 
affected employee performance with a significance value of 0.00. Meanwhile, leadership style, work 
environment, and employee performance substantially affect service quality with a significance value of 
0.00. Testing the indirect effect of leadership style on service quality through employee performance is 
significantly positive. In contrast, the work environment on service quality through employee performance 
negatively correlates but still has a significant relationship (0.28).

1. Introduction 
As Fiedler's contingency theory is a process in which a leader's ability to exert influence depends on the group task 
situation and the levels of his leadership style, personality, and approach according to the group, in other words, a 
leader is not due to the characteristics of the group. On his character, but because of various factors the situation and 
the inability to influence. Furthermore, Fiedler concluded that the leadership style would predict the progress of job

3169","mployees, the lower the level of service quality will be. The correlation of the two variables is also significant because 
the significant number is 0.000 <0.05; The value of the path coefficient X2 to Y2 is -0.136 with a significance of 0.28. 
The correlation of -0.136 means that the relationship between the Work Environment variable (X2) and Service 
Quality is negative or less intense because the correlation coefficient is negative. Although the relationship between 
variables is not strong enough, the relationship between the two variables is unidirectional and significant because the 
significance value is 0.028 <0.05. A unidirectional relationship means the better the Work Environment that 
employees feel, the better the Service Quality. Vice versa, the worse the leadership style received by employees, the 
lower the level of service quality will be. So, it can conclude that although the work environment has a negative or 
less strong relationship to Service Quality, it is still in the same direction and has a significant influence; The path 
coefficient value of Y1 to Y2 is 0.773 with a significance of 0.00, which proves that Y1 has a significant positive 
effect on Y2. The correlation of 0.773 means that the relationship between Employee Performance and Service Quality 
variables is powerful and unidirectional (because the correlation coefficient results are positive). Unidirectional 
means, the better the employee performance, the service quality will also increase Vice versa, the worse the employee 
performance, the lower the level of service quality. The correlation of the two variables is also significant because the 
significant value is 0.000 <0.05. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on data analysis using route analysis, it is possible to infer that leadership style and work climate significantly 
affect employees' performance at Mamuju Tengah Regency's Public Housing and Settlement Areas. Similarly, the 
leadership style has a powerful and essential impact on service quality. It found the relationship between work 
environment and service quality to be less solid or negative, but it significantly impacted service quality. The indirect 
path analysis hypothesis testing has shown a positive and vital impact of Leadership Style on Employee Performance 
in Public Services. Similarly, the work environment has a positive and essential effect on service quality through 
employee performance. It is hoped that the Office of Public Housing and Settlement Areas of Central Mamuju 
Regency's leadership style, which has been very good so far. It can be further established and strengthened to realize 
employee efficiency, especially in improving the community's quality of service. It is hoped that researchers will be 
able to deepen further and refine their study, given that there are still other variables that influence employee 
efficiency.

The evolution of GRDP demonstrates a region's economic growth. The state of the regional or regional economy is 
highly dependent on its capacity and resources. In improving an established opportunity, the district government's 
policies, steps, and efforts. Mamuju Central was completed to boost the regional economy. All activities and measures

3180","management. In this study, the effectiveness of financial performance has not been able to mediate the effect of PAD 
on economic growth. 
 
This is because the local government has not been able to maximize the local revenue earned. The management of 
regional income is still mostly channeled into unproductive work programs. Also, this is because the Regional 
Government allocates funds based on the awareness of the provincial government itself, not based on the priority of 
regional needs in assessing economic growth. 
 
The Effect of Capital Expenditure Management on Economic Growth through the Effectiveness of Financial 
Performance Managing capital expenditures on economic growth through the effectiveness of regional financial 
performance in the Mamuju Central district is insignificant. This means that an increase in the management of capital 
spending through the efficacy of financial performance does not have a tangible impact on economic growth, if other 
factors that influence it are constant. 
 
Based on Government Regulation Number 71 of 2010, capital expenditure is a budget expenditure to obtain fixed 
assets and others that can provide more benefits in one accounting period. Capital expenditures are an essential 
requirement for providing services to the public/public. The ability to allocate regional finances, shown by the 
effectiveness of regional financial performance, has not maximally influenced economic growth. Other factors that 
affect economic development, such as the local government's investment, are issued as a growth stimulus. Whether 
large or small, regional investment is realized through the proportion of capital expenditure, whether or not the 
financial performance of the region influences it. In this case, the regional financial performance does not significantly 
affect the Central Mamuju district's economic growth. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Following the results of the research and discussion, as stated, it can draw the following conclusions: PAD and Capital 
Expenditure Management do not influence the Effectiveness of Regional Financial Performance in Central Mamuju 
Regency; PAD and Capital Expenditure Management have had a significant positive effect on Economic Growth in 
Central Mamuju District; Effectiveness of Regional Financial Performance has no influence on Economic Growth in 
Central Mamuju Regency; PAD and Capital Expenditure Management do not have a significant impact on Economic 
Growth in Central Mamuju District through the Effectiveness of Regional Financial Performance. This study's 
suggestions are as follows: 1) To further optimize the regional financial performance and all parties involved in 
maximizing the economic growth rate of Central Mamuju Regency. 2) More maximizing the realization of regional 
income and expenditure budgets, including the management of capital expenditures in future periods, will indirectly 
affect regional financial performance to encourage increased economic growth. 3) To maximize existing PAD sources 
and explore potentials that might become sources of PAD to increase regional independence and minimize dependence 
on external funding sources. 4) For further researchers, it is recommended to take a different sample from this study. 
It is expected that using a diverse selection can have a significant influence on the Effectiveness of Regional Financial 
Performance in Central Mamuju District. 5) It is hoped that the following researchers who are interested in studying 
the Economic Growth and the Effectiveness of Regional Financial Performance in Central Mamuju Regency should 
also make a comprehensive comparison of the districts in West Sulawesi Province so that it can be known about the 
Economic Growth and Effectiveness of Regional Financial Performance in the Regency.

3189","6. Conclusion 
Based on the results and discussion, it can conclude that the variable with the most significant level of influence is the 
variable of motivation on organizational commitment. Competence is also a variable that affects organizational 
commitment and performance; the existence of knowledge, skills, character, motives, and self-concept encourages 
employees to be better at creating loyalty and account. On the indirect effect, the intervening variable organizational 
commitment is a variable that is good enough to moderate the motivation and competence variables on performance. 
Although the indirect effect provides a small path value, it is considered that the direct impact will be more effective 
in influencing performance than the presence of intervening variables. An increase in exemplary organizational 
commitment will also impact improving employee performance for the better.

3196","indirect effect is smaller than the value of the direct effect. It is done by the Sobel test, guided by the table that is equal 
to 1.664, and obtained from the Sobel test of 2.868. This shows that t-count> t-table or 2,868> 1,664, it can be 
concluded, the seventh hypothesis which states ""Motivation has a Positive and Significant Effect on the Discovery of 
TB Patients Through the Quality of Officers' Services in Polman District Health Office"" accepted or proven. 
 
This is evidenced by the respondents' high perception of the motivational variable, which indicates that the officer is 
responsible for carrying out the tasks assigned and possibly following the direction received. This study's results are 
in line with the theory revealed by Malayu S.P Hasibuan (2009), which states that motivation concerns how to direct 
subordinates' potential power so that they are willing to work together productively to achieve and realize the goals 
that have been determined. The results of this study are in line with the research of Joyo Minardo (2012). Their 
research results show that officers' motivation is low because the work is the appointment of the leader of the health 
center and requires a long time and risk of contracting it by sufferers. Completing work is less because of the heavy 
workload, working without targets, and motivation. Officers do not get compensation, need support from the 
leadership to issue ideas and ideas in case finding. There are no means of transportation for case finding. PHC  does 
not plan to implement a case-finding program policy, and the supervision system for coverage of case findings is not 
optimal. Conclusion: It was concluded that pulmonary tuberculosis officers' motivation in case finding was still low 
because there was no support and responsibility was still lacking, and the compensation and supervision system did 
not yet exist. 
 
Someone will like a job if the job is following their abilities, so he feels proud to do it. Jobs that are unpopular and 
less challenging are usually not able to be the driving force. Even the work tends to be a boring routine and not become 
pride. Therefore strong motivation plays an essential role in discovering TB patients in the Polman District Health 
Office. The presence or absence of a motivational impetus in an officer in carrying out his work in an organization 
will reflect the quality of service that is efficient, timely, according to procedures, maximum and professional 
following what is needed by patients or the community. A reasonably good quality of service from an officer will 
produce optimal satisfaction for patients or the community. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion previously stated, it can be concluded several things as follows: 
Competence has a positive and significant effect on the quality of service of officers in Polman District Health Office; 
Motivation has a positive and significant impact on the quality of service of officers in Polman District Health Office; 
Service quality influences positive and significant impact on the discovery of TB patients in the Polman District Health 
Office; Competence has a positive and significant effect on the discovery of TB patients in the Polman District Health 
Office; Motivation has a positive and significant effect on the discovery of TB patients in the Polman District Health 
Office; Competence has a positive and significant effect on findings TB patients through the quality of service officers 
in the Polman District Health Office; motivation has a positive and significant effect on TB patients' discovery through 
service officers' grades in the Health Office Polman Regency.

1. Introduction 
HR (human resources) is a vital asset in an organization. Employees can have abilities if appropriately managed, but 
it will become a burden if not handled properly. The quality of human resources will be a strength for management 
and support an organization's performance to achieve reasonable goals, according to Risambessy et al. (2012).

3207","The results of the analysis of the influence of Work Motivation (Y 1), on Performance (Y2) obtained an equation 
namely: Y₂ = 0 + 0.316x + 0.198x₂ + 0.407Y + 0.308. The equation can be interpreted that if the Work Motivation 
(Y1) rises by 1 point or one score, it will be followed by a performance increase (Y2)of 0.407 points. The influence 
of Motivation on Performance is positive and significant. This is evidenced by the value of the coefficient result, 
which is 0.407 with a significance level of 0.000 < 0.05. This means that good work motivation in the organization 
will also be followed by improved performance if other factors that affect the magnitude of performance are considered 
constant. That is, the better the motivation; performance improvements will follow it. The coefficient value can also 
be interpreted, an increase of 0.407 from the performance of each one-unit increase of the Work  
 
5. Conclusions  
The research results and discussion in the previous meeting related to leadership and work environment on 
performance through employee work motivation can be concluded as follows. First, leadership affects work 
motivation. This means that an increase will also follow good leadership in the organization in work motivation if 
other factors that affect work motivation are considered constant. This means that the better the administration, the 
higher work motivation will also be followed. Second, the work environment affects work motivation. This shows 
that an increase will also follow a good work environment in the organization in work motivation if other factors that 
affect work motivation are considered constant. This means that the better the work environment, the better work 
motivation will be. Third, leadership affects performance; this means that an increase will also follow good leadership 
in the organization in concert if other factors that affect the performance's size are considered constant. That is, the 
better the administration; it will be followed by improved performance. Fourth, the work environment affects 
performance; this indicates that an increase will also follow a good work environment in the organization in concert 
if other factors that affect the performance's size are considered constant. This means that the better the work 
environment, the better understanding will be followed. Fifth, motivation affects performance; this indicates that an 
increase will also follow good work motivation in the organization in concert if other factors that affect the 
commission's size are considered constant. That is, the better the motivation, the better the account will be. Sixth, 
leadership affects performance through work motivation. This means that good leadership in the organization will be 
followed by increased work motivation and an increase in a good performance. Seventh, the work environment affects 
performance through work motivation. This means that a good work environment in the organization will be followed 
by increased work motivation and improved performance. To improve employee performance, good leadership is 
needed by providing employee motivation through providing security guarantees. Especially field employees and 
rewards or rewards in kind, both in the form of incentives and other forms of employee performance, create a 
conducive work environment both physically, psychologically, and socially.

Abstract 
This study aims to find room head supervision and the nursing staff's knowledge on patient safety through 
the quality of nursing services at the West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital. In this study, the research design 
used was an analytical survey with a quantitative approach. The sample in this study were all nurses in the 
West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital's nursing room, which were taken using a non-probability sampling 
technique using a proportional random sampling technique. This study's population was 167 respondents, 
who were analyzed using path analysis with multiple linear regression tests. The results showed that: 1) the 
head of the room's supervision on the quality of nursing services in the West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital 
had a positive and significant effect. 2) The nurses' knowledge of the quality of nursing services in West 
Sulawesi Provincial Hospital has a positive and significant impact. 3) Supervision of the head of the room 
on patient safety has a positive and significant effect. 4) The nurse's knowledge of patient safety has a 
positive and significant impact. 5) The quality of nursing services on patient safety has a positive and 
significant impact. 6) Supervision of the head of the room on patient safety has a positive but insignificant 
relationship through the quality of nursing services at the West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital. And 7) the 
knowledge of the nurse administrators on patient safety is positively related but not significant through the 
quality of nursing services in the West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital.

3214","5. Discussion 
The head of the room plays a role in supervising. Still, the head of the room must also provide direction and education 
to his subordinates in carrying out their duties and responsibilities, especially in helping nurses who are having 
difficulties in carrying out their duties. From the results of the path analysis carried out, it can be concluded that the 
adequate supervision of the head of the room has a positive effect on patient safety at the West Sulawesi Provincial 
Hospital. This can be proven by the results of the multiple linear regression test model II, where the products are 
obtained a probability value (sig) 0.0.004 (p <0.05). Therefore, the author's third hypothesis fulfills the requirements 
and is stated to have a positive and significant effect. This shows that if the head of the room can carry out his role 
optimally and well, it will affect his subordinates' performance, the better, and vice versa. 
 
One of the goals carried out by the head of the room in supervising his subordinates is to improve the quality of work, 
especially in encouraging the nurse to build good relationships with the patient and the patient's family members. 
However, if the supervision carried out by the head of the room is good, but the quality of service has not been running 
optimally, then the head of the room needs to see and evaluate the constraints and causes. From the results of this 
study, we can see that it turns out that the nurses at the Regional General Hospital of West Sulawesi Province are still 
primarily volunteers. From this, we can conclude that one of the reasons why the head room's supervision has no 
relationship to patient safety is voluntary employment status. This can make the nurse in charge not carry out their 
duties properly because the wages received, and their performance is not balanced. 
 
Based on the multiple linear regression test results using the path coefficient of model II, the direct effect value is 
0.316, and the indirect effect is 0.033, where the value of the indirect effect is smaller than the value of the immediate 
impact. To test this hypothesis, a test using the Sobel test guided by the t-table is as large as 1.654. And the t-count 
obtained from the Sobel test is 0.537. This shows that t-count <table table, so, this hypothesis proposed by the 
researcher about ""Knowledge of Implementing Nurses Has a Positive and Significant Effect on Nursing Services 
through the Quality of Nursing Services at the Regional General Hospital of West Sulawesi Province"" is rejected or 
not proven. This research is in line with the theory that if the nurse's knowledge is good, then the resulting performance 
will be good. Vice versa that if the experience is lacking, the commission will also decrease (Davis, 2005; Mu’adi et 
al., 2020; Nawawi et al., 2020). Apart from that, Sulihandari (2013) also reveals that Professionals in work must have 
good orientation in the field of service and have practice standards and code of ethics to protect the community, 
especially patients. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the research hypothesis, there is no positive relationship due to the respondent's voluntary employment status. 
Still, it turns out that staffing can also affect the quality of the performance of a nurse in charge. From the research 
carried out by nurses at the West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital, there are still many who have D3 Nursing education. 
Apart from that, nursing nurses are also rarely and never given training on patient safety. One of the advantages of 
someone having a good knowledge is to improve the quality of the performance that is being carried out because that 
person will apply the knowledge they have in the current field of work. In wrestling, but several factors make a person 
feel discouraged in carrying out the task at hand. Among them is because the leader lacks motivation and 
encouragement. Likely, the results that subordinates have obtained are not considered by the boss or the people around 
him. Apart from that, what can affect minimum wages can also affect employees who are reluctant to carry out their 
duties properly, so that from this, the quality of the service can decrease or not be carried out well at all.

3223","The Influence of Work Experience on Family Planning Services at CHC in Bulukumpa district, Bulukumba regency 
is positive and significant for family planning services at CHC in Bulukumpa district, Bulukumba regency. Several 
previous researchers have also conducted research, including (Indrawati, 2018) whose findings show the results of 
multiple linear regression tests with a confidence level of α = 0.05. The results of work experience research have a 
positive and significant effect on employee performance. The quality of family planning services that are efficient and 
maximum can be seen from the midwives who have a lot of work experience because sufficient work experience can 
create the attitudes, abilities, and skills of a person in providing professional services. According to (Zainullah & Amin 
et al., 2012), the more someone does the job, the more experience is gained, as opinion shows that a high level of 
routine makes employees more skilled/skilled. The knowledge of family planning (KB) officers in providing family 
planning services are the main asset in this service. The more experienced, the easier it is to find solutions. This means 
that the skills, quality of work, and creativity of midwives in implementing family planning services are strongly 
influenced by the experience of midwives who provide family planning (KB) services, which can increase the 
achievement of family planning services. 
 
The Influence of Individual Characteristics on Family Planning Services through Midwife Competence at Public 
Health Centers in Bulukumpa district, Bulukumba regency is negative and insignificant. The respondents' low 
perception also occurred in the descriptive results of the midwife's competency variable on the second indicator, which 
stated the skills that officers had were by their work at the CHC in Bulukumpa district, Bulukumba regency. This is 
also due to the high cultural influence in the family requiring an employee to apply limited skills. This opinion is not 
in line with the results of previous research conducted by (Ajeng Citra Dewi, 2016) that core competencies are very 
influential in improving performance. Increasing competence through formal and non-formal education, mastery of 
technology and information, social media, technical knowledge, monitoring evaluation, effective counseling can 
improve clients' services besides competency development supported by government policies. The higher the 
employee's ability to do the job, the better their attitude towards the job, and their interest in the employee's position 
will increase. 
 
The Influence of Work Experience on Family Planning Services through Midwife Competence at CHC in Bulukumpa 
district, Bulukumba regency is negative and insignificant. The study results contradict research (Ajeng Citra Dewi, 
2016), which shows a significant positive effect between work experience and audit quality. Meanwhile, according to 
Trijoko's opinion in (S. Robbins, 2015), work experience is a skill/knowledge that individuals master after working 
for a specific time. The work experience possessed by an employee at the CHC in Bulukumpa district, Bulukumba 
regency should have a very influential role in providing family planning services to the community or homemakers 
who need these services excellently efficiently. A person with total work experience will be more competent, efficient, 
and maximal in providing services to patients or the community. According to Spencer & Spencer (Moeheriono, 
2010), competence as a person's fundamental ability related to the effectiveness of work performance or the basic 
skills possessed can have a casual or causal effect with criteria that serve as guidelines and are effective or perform 
well in the company.

1. Introduction 
Regional Revenue and Expenditure Budget (APBD) aims to support governance, fostering, and regional community 
development. In general, provincial spending can be classified into routine and development expenditures. Routine 
expenditure is intended to finance activities / operational activities of the regional government. Meanwhile, 
development spending is designed to be enjoyed directly by the community through development. Decentralization to

3234","The effect of the region's total original income(X1) on poverty(Y2) was-1,345 + -6,357= -7,702. This indicates that 
the region's native income increases poverty through a combined direct and indirect influence of -7,702; The total 
effect of the General Allocation Fund(X2) on poverty(Y2) is -0.365 + -8.473= -8.838. This indicates that the general 
allocation fund can reduce poverty through a combination of direct influence and not -8,838; The total effect of 
economic growth (Y1) on poverty(Y2) was -1,294. This suggests economic growth could reduce poverty by -1,294. 
 
The effect of Regional Native Income on Economic Grows this positive. This is seen in the region's original revenue 
path analysis has a significant favorable influence on economic growth. The results are in line with the statement that 
those with positive PAD levels are more likely to get a better income per   Capita. PAD  has a positive influence on 
regional economic growth  (Iskandar Putong, 2010). PAD is a source of provincial spending. If PAD increases, the 
funds owned will be higher. Pad growth continuously results in increased economic growth. The rise in PAD has an 
impact on the economy.  Therefore, the region cannot succeed if the area does not experience economic growth. 
 
The effect of the General Allocation Fund on Economic Grows this positive. These results are in line with Jolianis’s 
research (2016), the conclusion that DAU has a significant influence on economic growth. Furthermore, the study 
found that there is a significant favorable influence of DAU on economic growth. Then, (Stepvani Uhise, 2013), 
research shows that DAU has a significant-good power on Economic Growth. The effect of local indigenous income 
on poverty is negative. It means that the increase in local indigenous revenue will be followed by reducing poverty, 
assuming factors are considered constant. The study results are in line with research that there is an influence of local 
native income on poverty. Then, research  (Paul, Koleangan, & Engka, 2017) found that the impact of Regional Native 
Income on poverty is negative 
 
The Effect of the General Allocation Fund on Poverty. The variable effect of general allocation funds on poverty is 
negative. It means that the increase in available allocation funds will be followed by reducing poverty, assuming other 
factors are considered constant. This study's results are in line with the statement (Hanif, 2005)that weak planning in 
the allocation of spending poses inefficiencies to the performance of this, impacting. This study's results are in line 
with (Paseki, Greri, & Naukoko, 2014) that the general allocation fund has a significant effect on poverty reduction. 
Furthermore, research (Rudi, 2014), that  DAU  has a considerable influence on poverty. 
 
The Influence of Local Native Income on Poverty through Economic Growth. This research shows a significant 
influence of the region's native income on poverty through economic growth.   This is seen in the results of the path 
analysis. Economic growth can affect pad against poverty. The effect of the General Allocation Fund on Poverty 
through Economic Growth is significant.   We can see from path analysis. Thus, economic growth can influence the 
general allocation fund against poverty. This study's results also follow Todaro's statement (in  (Nurmainah, 2013) 
that the accumulation of capital occurs when a portion of the revenue is reinvested to increase output. The source of 
the investment funds comes from DAU. Funds sourced from the state budget are allocated for regional equalization. 
The effect of economic growth on poverty is negative. It means increased economic growth followed by poverty 
reduction, assuming other factors are considered constant. This study shows the negative influence of economic 
growth on poverty. This study supports the results (Tambunan, 2011) that economic growth is not accompanied by 
employment opportunities creating a gap, which then creates economic growth conditions and increased poverty 
levels.  Growth with poverty has a strong correlation because poverty tends to rise in the early stages of development. 
Near the end of the story, the number of poor people decreases gradually  (Tambunan, 2011). 
 
5. Conclusion 
The region's original income had a positive and significant impact on economic growth in Central Mamuju Regency. 
Thus, it can be concluded that the region's native income will affect economic growth; The general allocation fund 
has a positive and significant effect on economic growth in Central Mamuju Regency. It is thus concluded that the 
general allocation fund affects economic growth; The region's indigenous income has a positive and significant effect 
on poverty in Central Mamuju Regency. Thus, it is concluded that the region's original income affects poverty; The 
general allocation fund has a positive and significant effect on poverty in Central Mamuju Regency. It is thus 
concluded that the general allocation fund affects poverty; The region's native income has a positive and significant 
effect on poverty through economic growth in Central Mamuju Regency. Thus, it is concluded that the region's native 
income affects poverty through economic growth; The general allocation fund has a positive and significant effect on 
poverty through economic growth in Central Mamuju Regency. It is thus concluded that the general allocation fund 
will affect poverty through economic growth; Economic growth has a positive and significant effect on poverty in 
Central Mamuju Regency. Thus, it is concluded that economic growth affects poverty.

3241","impact of varied competencies on patient satisfaction means that the patient will be satisfied if a nurse is competent 
in providing health services.   
 
Effect of Nurse Motivation on patient satisfaction, From the test results, Nurse Motivation's influence on patient 
satisfaction showed a positive and significant impact between nurse motivation variables. The nurse's motivation is 
so needed that the nurse is passionate about doing her job. Nurse motivation comes from the word more (Latin) to 
move, pushing, or forcing. Nurse motivation is an effort to achieve the desire of an organization by optimizing 
individuals' abilities (Mangkunegara,2007). 
 
The influence of competence on patient satisfaction through the Professional Nursing Care Model (MAKP) team, 
From the test results, it was obtained that there is mediation between competency variables to patient satisfaction 
through MAKP Team. MAKP team is a model of applying nursing care conducted in a team to provide complete 
health services. Professional nurses certainly have competence, so nurses must be able to position themselves as 
persons who understand their duties and responsibilities to patients. If all nurses own, this will undoubtedly provide 
satisfaction for a patient who has been given health services.  
 
Effect of Nurse Motivation on patient satisfaction through Professional Nursing Care Model (MAKP) team, From the 
test results of Nurse Motivation to patient satisfaction, there is mediation where the nurse motivation variable can 
directly affect the patient satisfaction variable. With the implementation of MAKP, the team can feel satisfied with 
the client and nurses. Nurses better understand and know each client's needs so that the client will feel treated more 
humanely. 
 
The impact of the team's Professional Nursing Care Model (MAKP) on patient satisfaction, Testing the unit on patient 
satisfaction showed a positive and significant influence between the team's MAKP variables on patient satisfaction. 
For nursing care to be successful, it needs to be planned and directed carefully as nursing's duty and responsibility. 
Nursing care is provided by a team of 2 or more nurses.

and Motivation on Patient Satisfaction through the Professional Nursing Care Model (MAKP) Team.  in the Inpatient 
Room of the West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital. It can be concluded that the better the competence and motivation of

Abstract 
The purpose of this study aims to analyze the effect of teaching experience and education level on teacher 
workload and performance, to analyze the impact of workload and teaching experience on teacher 
performance, to analyze the effect of education level on performance through workload at the Formal 
Education Unit (SPF) of Senior High School (SMAN) at the Makassar Regional Office 1 Branch. This 
research is a quantitative study using statistical data analysis with a path analysis model. The sample in this 
study population was 118 people, namely 56 people from the UPT Formal Education Unit SMAN (State 
Senior High School), 7 Makassar, and 62 people from SMAN (Public Senior High School) 22 Makassar. 
Data collection techniques through interviews, questionnaires, and documentation. The results of the study 
prove that: (1) Teaching experience and education level are significant and positive on teacher performance, 
(2) Teaching experience and education level have no significant or insignificant effect on teacher 
performance, (3) Workload and teaching experience have a positive and significant impact on teacher 
performance, and (4) Education level is substantial and positive on teacher performance through workload.

1. Introduction 
If we look closely, the reality of education in Indonesia today is still far from expectations. The fact of global 
competence forces the Indonesian people to improve the quality of education. Problems that need to be addressed are 
the low equal distribution of learning opportunities, poor academic quality, low internal efficiency, external efficiency 
(educational relevance), and the tendency to decline in character or morals. In dealing with these problems, 
comprehensive efforts are needed. Education personnel is one of the most decisive factors in the success of school

3255","with a significance of 0.000 is below 0.05 or 5%. Therefore, teaching experience (X1) has effect and significant on 
workload (Y1). Based on that were hypothesis, the teaching experience positively and significantly impacts UPT SPF's 
workload (Formal Education Unit) SMAN in Education Office Branch Region 1 Makassar, proven. 
 
The Direct Impact of Education Levels on Workloads; The beta coefficient of educational level influence (X2) on 
workload (Y1) is with a value of 4,960 on SE worth 0.654 with a significance of 0.000. This data shows where the 
influence of education level (X2) has a positive and significant workload (Y1). This means an increase in education 
level (X2) followed by an increase in workload (Y1), if other factors that affect workload (Y1) are constant. The 
statistical value of the beta coefficient of educational level influence (X2) on workload (Y1) was 4,960 with a 
significance of 0.000 below 0.05 or 5%. This means that the level of education (X2) has a significant and positive 
influence on workload (Y1), based on the hypothesis of the level of education is substantial and favorable to the 
workload at up SPF (Formal Education Unit) SMAN in the Branch Of Education Office Region 1 Makassar, proven. 
 
Direct Influence of Teaching Experience on Teacher Performance; The beta coefficient of teaching experience (X1) 
on teacher performance (Y2) worth -0.018, an SE value of 0.036 is with a significance level of 0.621 (insignificant). 
This suggests that teaching experience (X1) is negligible on teacher performance (Y2). This means that the 
improvement of teaching experience (X1) does not significantly or does not have a tangible impact on teacher 
performance (Y2) if other factors that affect teacher performance (Y2) are constant. The statistical value of the beta 
coefficient of teaching experience (X1) on teacher performance (Y2) was -0.018 (insignificant). This shows that the 
teaching experience (X1) is inconsequential to its version (Y2). Thus hypothesis 3, which states that the teaching 
experience has no positive and insignificant effect on teachers' performance in the SPF (Formal Education Unit) 
SMAN in the Branch education office region 1 Makassar, is not proven. 
 
The Direct Influence of Education Level on Teacher Performance; The beta coefficient of educational level influence 
(X2) on Teacher Performance (Y2) worth -0.279 and SE worth 0.176 is with significance level 0.121 (insignificant). 
This indicates that the power of education level (X2) is negligible on teacher performance (Y2). This means that the 
increase in the level of education (X2) is not followed by improved teacher performance (Y2), assuming other factors 
that affect the teacher's health (Y2) are considered constant. The statistical value of the beta coefficient of the effect 
of education level (X2) on teacher performance (Y2) was -0.279 (insignificant). This indicates that the level of 
education (X2) is not significant to teachers' implementation (Y2). Based on that, hypothesized four states that 
education has no positive and insignificant effect on teachers' performance in the SPF (Formal Education Unit) SMAN 
in the Branch education office region 1 Makassar proved. 
 
Direct Impact of Workload on Teacher Performance; The beta coefficient of workload (Y1) on teacher performance 
(Y2) 0.090 with SE0.022 with significance level 0.000. This means that the influence workload (Y1) has a positive 
and significant influence on teacher performance (Y2). This means increased workload (Y1) has an impact on 
improving teacher performance (Y2) and assumes that other factors affecting teacher performance (Y2) are constant. 
The statistical value of the beta coefficient of workload (Y1) on teacher performance (Y2) was 0.090 with a 
significance of 0.000 below 0.05 or 5%. This shows that workload (Y1) has a significant and positive influence on 
teacher performance (Y2), hypothesis 5 where workload has a positive and significant effect on teacher performance 
at UPT SPF (Formal Education Unit) SMAN in The Education Office Branch of Region 1 Makassar, proven. Based 
on the results contained in table 4.7, the total effect (total effect), independent variables, namely teaching experience,

workload of the formal education unit task of the SMAN branch of education in the region 1 Makassar. 
Two variables do not have a positive and significant effect in this study, namely the impact of teaching experience on 
teacher performance and the effect of education level on teachers' performance in the standard education unit of the 
SMAN branch of education in region 1 Makassar. The recommendation for this research is that there is a policy to 
motivate teachers to continue higher education according to their interests and competencies towards more 
professional teachers, so it is recommended to the head of the regional education branch office one and school 
principals to review school/education management

1. The direct influence of leadership on motivation (X1 -> Y1) 
The immediate effect of administration on the work motivation of 0.197. Sig value. 0.019 < 0.05, meaning there 
is a positive and significant influence between leadership and nurse work motivation. 
2. Direct Influence of Incentives on Motivation (X2 -> Y1) 
The direct influence of Incentives on the work motivation of 0.203. Sig value. 0.016 < 0.05, meaning there is a 
positive and significant influence between Incentives on nurse work motivation. 
3. Direct Influence of Leadership on Nurse Performance (X1 -> Y2) 
The direct influence of leadership on Nurse Performance of 0.281. Sig value. 0.001 < 0.05, meaning there is a 
positive and significant influence between leadership on nurse performance.

value of 0.203 x 0.162 = 0.032 then leadership has a positive but insignificant effect on nurses' performance. This 
is because the direct influence coefficient value (X2>Y2 = 0.193) is greater than the indirect influence (X2-> Y1 
-> Y2 = 0.032). 
 
5. Discussion 
Every leader must be able to provide clear information and for that he must have the ability to communicate well and 
smoothly. Because with good and smooth communication, of course this will make it easier for subordinates to grasp 
what a leader wants. A leader must have the ability to communicate well and smoothly, of course, must also have the 
ability to provide encouragement or motivation to his subordinates (Lionardo et al., 2020; Yusuf et al., 2019). The 
attention of a leader will be very meaningful to subordinates, that in terms of appreciation or recognition, it gives a 
very high meaning to employees or subordinates. Not every leader is capable of leading, because with regard to one's 
talents to have the ability to lead is different. This can be seen in their leadership style, whether they have autocratic, 
participatory, or free-control leadership styles. A leader must be able to make decisions based on facts and regulations 
that apply in the company and the decisions taken can provide motivation for employees to work better and even be 
able to contribute to the progress of the company. A leader in running an organization or company, although with 
different leadership styles, of course, must provide a sense of security for employees (subordinates) who work. In 
connection with the writing of the final report which only discusses motivation, the writing of this report takes one 
variable related to the title, namely the provision of motivation. 
Decision-making consists of two alternatives, namely the alternative of making decisions on personal problems and 
the alternative of making decisions on group problems. The first alternative is done by making decisions based on 
information that is owned by yourself, or based on information from subordinates, or spreading problems to 
subordinates to get ideas and suggestions or spreading problems to a subordinate, then jointly analyze and make 
decisions or delegate problems to a subordinate. while equipping him with compatible information and giving him 
responsibility for problem solving (Nuraini et al., 2019; Umanailo, 2020, 2019). The second alternative, namely the 
main problem is solved by solving the problem yourself or obtaining information from subordinates and leaders who 
solve it, or sharing problems with subordinates individually to get ideas and suggestions, or sharing the problem 
through group meetings to get ideas and suggestions, or share the problem. the problem to a group and with the leader 
to reach agreement in problem solving and decision making. 
 
6. Conclusion 
According to Rivai (2003) states that leadership requires an effective form of human relationship. This means that 
human relationships in leadership are the way a leader treats the people he leads. This research tries to create a model

maximize or increase nurses' work motivation. So that further motivation will improve the performance of nurses. 
Based on these findings, several things are of interest to researchers in improving nurse performance. First, leadership 
and incentives increase nurses' work motivation, so the better the leadership and invent administration, the better 
nurses' work motivation. Second, the role of leadership, incentives, and inspiration improve nurses' performance, so 
the better administration, incentives, and work motivation, nurses' performance will also increase. Third, the direct 
effect has a more significant influence than the indirect effect. To improve nurses' performance, good leadership is 
needed, sufficient incentives for nurses' welfare, and good work motivation.

Human Resources (HR) is one of the most critical factors that cannot be separated from an organization, either a 
company or an instinct. Besides, HR is also a factor that influences the development of an organization. HR is a human 
being employed in an organization who will later be a driving force to achieve its goals. In addition to encouraging 
employees to work harder, superiors must also discipline their employees. Discipline has a central role in shaping a 
productive work ethic (Sinungan, 2009, Mu’adi et al., 2020; Nawawi et al., 2020). According to Government 
Regulation No. 53/2010, it has been regulated that the obligations that must be obeyed and the prohibitions that any 
civil servant cannot violate are forms of discipline instilled in every civil servant. Employee discipline is essential to 
comply with existing regulations, procedures, and policies to produce a good performance (Slamet, 2007).

1. Introduction 
The development of the current government bureaucracy demands the State Civil Apparatus (ASN) that becomes a 
role model and example in the community to change the administration's mindset. The State Civil Apparatus paradigm 
has always been ""served"" has undergone a significant change to ""Serve."" Providing the best service to the community 
is the embodiment of the function of the State Civil Apparatus inherent in implementing the performance of the 
apparatus itself. In the sense that the State Civil Apparatus is required at the best service, it must carry out its other 
functions effectively and efficiently. In general, the State Civil Apparatus functions currently exist 3 (three), namely 
as public servants, as unifying and adhesive of the nation, and as implementers of policies. 
 
Implementing services to the community is one of the answers to the public's demands for an effective and efficient 
government bureaucracy, undoubtedly supported by various facilities and public services accuracy. Ease and accuracy 
in the service following the community's needs, hinting that the apparatus's performance can be accounted for because 
the community feels its requirements have been following the touch of service provided by the apparatus. Thus, with

3703","Tamalate district is one of the sub-districts located in the Jeneponto Regency with Nine villages situated in coastal 
areas and 3 (three) high altitude areas that vary in height sea level, with a distance to the capital of the district about 
one to ten kilometers. To the district's capital, about seven to twenty kilometers, as for the furthest distance in the 
village Bonto Sunggu, about twenty kilometers from the Jeneponto regency's money. In contrast, the closest distance 
to the town is Manjangloe, about seven kilometers. As an implementation of government participation, Tamalate 
District has 137 ASN consisting of 95 men and 42 women in several agencies under the coordination of the Sub-
District, namely the District Office, Ministry of Education, Public Health Centre (PHC), Office of Religious Affairs, 
BKKBN, Agriculture, Plantation, Livestock, forestry, statistics. The number increases when in the previous year's 
appeal this is due to employees' acceptance, be it general admission or acceptance from honorees to civil servants. 
Tamalate district is one of the government bureaucracies that directly contact the community, which is still not 
supported by the community's infrastructure of services. This is one of the factors of lack of motivation of the state 
civil apparatus, thus impacting the spirit of teamwork in optimizing the implementation of tasks and functions and 
improving performance. 
 
Besides the room that is not comfortable because it still does not have air conditioning, this can reduce working 
comfort. The motivation of work caused by career levels in the organization is still about fifteen percent of respondents 
who have not agreed from that side. For organizational procedures that suit their work, only five percent have not 
approved the number is small compared to the civil apparatus of the State that agrees with it. This is evidenced by the 
standard rules of operational procedures for each activity owned by the agency. Then for the last indicator of 
interpersonal relationships, co-workers, bosses, and good subordinates, there are still about 20 respondents who have 
not agreed to this.  
 
Within Tamalate Subdistrict's scope, the agency provides equal opportunities for all employees to develop their careers 
in this particular position. This is evident from the answers of respondents who answered agree and strongly agreed 
in the estimated 86.1 percent means that employees agree that to be able to occupy a position and career at the level 
following the procedures set by the organization, given the opportunity to employees who meet specific requirements 
without any element of subjectivity. 
 
Following the variable indicator, ""Have a good interpersonal relationship, co-workers, superiors, and subordinates."" 
Teamwork, solid is expected to complement each other's processes to achieve the organization's goals maximally. 
Harmony between angora and members, leaders, and members will show maximum performance, contribute 
generously, and show the best results to the efforts carried out. Empirically, it can be seen that the motivation of work 
within Tamalate district still needs to get support as explained earlier that good interpersonal relationships, colleagues, 
superiors, and subordinates are required to build good teamwork as well. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the analysis and discussion that has been presented, it can be concluded as follows: 
1. Motivation affects the performance of employees. It can be indicated that the higher the motivation, the higher the 
performance of employees in the Tamalate subdistrict. 
2. Work Program affects Employee Performance / ASN. It can be indicated that the better the planned work program, 
the better employee performance / ASN will be in the Tamalate subdistrict. 
3. Motivation affects teamwork. This shows that the better motivation owned by employees / ASN, the teamwork 
will also be higher in the Tamalate subdistrict. 
4. Work Program affects teamwork. This shows that the better the planned work program, the higher the teamwork 
in Tamalate sub-district. 
5. Teamwork affects the Performance of Pergawai / ASN. It is indicated that the better the team's cooperation in 
working, the higher ASN performance in the Tamalate sub-district. 
6. Motivation affects the performance of ASN through teamwork. This means the State Civil Apparatus will perform 
well and have high motivation and supported by solid teamwork also in Tamalate subdistrict 
7. Work Program affects the performance of ASN through teamwork. It can be seen that a good work program can 
improve the performance of ASN if supported by good teamwork in the Tamalate sub-district.

Abstract 
The research aimed to determine and analyze how employees' performance documents and budget 
availability impact work capabilities at the Social Office of West Sulawesi Province. The study was 
conducted at the Social Office of West Sulawesi Province, using a causality design and quantitative 
approach. The populations were 108 employees of the Social Office of West Sulawesi Province, sampling 
using total sampling technique by involving all people as a sample, namely 108 employees. Data collection 
is done by using observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation. Data analysis used path 
analysis with SPSS version 25.0 program. The results showed that budget availability was the variable with 
the highest effect among other variables. Budget availability is an essential aspect of implementing a work 
program that has been announced by the Social Office of West Sulawesi Provincial. In terms of its 
implementation, budget availability is carried out appropriately by involving the legislature as the holder 
of budget authority. Also, the targets of program priority plans are shown comprehensively, accurately, and 
transparently. Document availability is also a determining factor in improving employee performance. The 
level and clarity of document filing as a benchmarks for employees to enhance their performance. However, 
sometimes the presentation is not always accurate. Work capability as an intervening variable has quite a 
significant effect in improving employee performance. Reporting done with a good level of work capability 
shows high organizational accountability. It avoids deviations and can also quickly evaluate if there are 
necessary things for improvement.

program that has been proclaimed by the Social Service of West Sulawesi Province. In terms of its performance, the 
budget provision is carried out appropriately by involving the legislature as the budget authority holder. The targets 
of the program priority plan are shown comprehensively, accurately, and transparently. In the program's 
implementation, the Social Service of West Sulawesi Province places priority programs whose objectives are clear 
and have the most significant interests that must be completed.  Consideration of timely reporting by employees with 
a good level of work capability is also the main thing prioritized by the Social Service of West Sulawesi Province. 
The proper reporting will be an excellent positive indication and a quick evaluation material for the relevant 
authorities. It will also be an easy path for the government if, in the end, budget for other programs. The availability 
of documents is also a factor that determines employee performance, the level, and clarity of form archiving as a 
benchmark for employees of the Social Service of West Sulawesi Province to improve their performance. However, 
the presentation is sometimes not always accurate. Documents as important archives can encourage the level of trust 
and quality of employees' work by displaying explicit document materials that can be easily accounted for.  Work 
capability as an intervening variable has a significant influence in improving employee performance. Reporting done 
with a good level of work capability shows the organization's high accountability to avoid irregularities and quickly 
evaluate if things need to be improved.

1. Introduction 
In implementing regional autonomy and fiscal decentralization, provincial governments are required to have greater 
regional financial independence. With a greater degree of economic freedom, the regions will no longer depend on 
the central and local governments' assistance through balancing funds. However, it does not mean that if the regional 
financial independence is high, the regions will no longer need to balance funds. Balancing funds are still required to 
accelerate regional development. The manifestation of transparency and accountability of state finances is realized 
through the preparation of financial reports. 
 
Local government reporting aims to present valuable information in making decisions on local governments' 
accountability as the party in charge of managing. The resources entrusted with carrying out government activities are 
development, and community services, which are obliged to submit reports on their regional financial accountability 
to assess whether they have successfully carried out their duties properly or not.   
 
Regional financial management not only requires reliable human resources but also needs support from adequate 
financial capacity. The ability of local governments to explore regional economic power can be seen from the regional 
financial performance measured using analysis regional financial ratios. Improvements in budget performance and 
regional financial management occupy an essential position in empowering local governments to implement regional

the pattern of relations between the central and provincial governments in implementing regional autonomy. To assess 
the Central Mamuju Regency Financial Agency Office's financial performance in implementing its financial 
performance by the pattern of relationships and the level of regional capacity. The higher the self-reliance ratio, the

3284","And awards are considered mediocre so that they cannot be used as a measure to encourage an increase in their 
performance. Also, several factors are the respondents' different average age, which is considered a factor in 
answering questions in terms of their mindset. The data results do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that 
there is always a positive effect of compensation on work motivation. 
 
This study is not in line with previous researchers' research; in a study conducted by Maria Ulfa et al. (2012) 
regarding compensation with changing work motivation, this change will shift employee work motivation. A 
positive sign indicates a positive direction of change in employee work motivation due to a change in 
compensation, which means that the employee's work motivation will also increase when there is a salary increase 
and vice versa. 
 
The sixth hypothesis testing shows that the direct effect of compensation on work motivation is -0.021. At the same 
time, the indirect impact of payment through discipline on employee work motivation is 0.110. The result of the t-
test with the Sobel test is 1.75, which is smaller than the t table with a significance level of 0.05, which is 1.98, so 
it can be concluded that discipline does not affect mediating the relationship between compensation and employee 
work motivation. 
 
The research finding is that discipline cannot mediate the relationship between compensation and work motivation 
because the level of motivation of an employee at work is influenced by several factors, such as satisfaction, 
leadership style, personal communication, and others. Discipline is also influenced by compensation, and discipline 
is something that can create motivation. 
 
The seventh hypothesis testing shows that discipline positively affects employee motivation at the XIV / 
Hasanuddin Military Regional Parent Regiment Educational Institution. This result is evidenced by the path 
coefficient analysis results, equal to 0.379, while the count value of 2.734 is more significant than t table 1.98. It 
can be concluded that discipline has a significant effect on work motivation. 
 
These results indicate that the discipline factor plays a vital role in the implementation of employee work. An 
employee who has a high level of discipline will still work well even without 
 
The leadership supervises them. Disciplined employees are always obedient to their work and will carry out other 
activities outside of working hours. That has nothing to do with work. Likewise, they will always comply with the 
work environment regulations, being aware of their responsibilities and workload. This study supports previous 
research conducted by Serly Herliantini (2016). There is an effect of work discipline and compensation on 
employee motivation at the Food Crops Agriculture Office of West Java Province. It is about 75.1% and the 
remaining 24.9% is influenced by other variables that are not researched. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the research results, there are several findings, namely. State defense education and compensation affect 
employee discipline; state defense education, and compensation impact work motivation. Therefore, state defense 
education and payment must be improved; State defense education affects work motivation mediated by discipline, 
but discipline does not judge the effect of compensation on work motivation. Because work motivation is not 
supported by compensation, it is necessary to find a gap in why employees at these institutions think that compensation 
is common and does not impact their work motivation. Employees' views on salaries and awards that have been 
received that make work mediocre also need to be reviewed and observations about things that are very meaningful 
in supporting their work motivation.

1. Introduction 
In the Global era today, the need for education is a priority and very important. This is following the mandate of the 
1945 Constitution that every citizen is entitled to a decent education. Therefore, the government's various efforts 
through educational institutions such as schools continue to make multiple efforts and innovations to improve 
education quality by improving teacher competence or by more effective learning media and attracting students to 
learn. Thus, education is needed to produce qualified and competitive human beings and have noble ethics and good 
morals. 
 
Based on the Technical implementation Unit (UPT) Primary school (SD) observations in Cluster I Ponre District Bone 
district, some teachers still carry out the learning process without using learning media such as visual media and audio, 
audiovisual media. So that during the learning process, many students play around, stories with their friends so that 
they lose concentration. In general, it can be said that teachers' performance, in general, has not been optimal to 
improve learners' learning performance.

Emphasis on positive things, namely the passion that the teacher puts on positive student behavior. It can emphasize 
providing positive reinforcement and teacher awareness to avoid mistakes that can interfere with teaching and learning 
activities. Apart from positive comments, positive teacher views are also fundamental to note. Many students feel 
confident in their performance and abilities with positive comments given by the teacher. A positive teacher's view 
can be interpreted as an attitude of trust in their students. This study's conclusion is class management and learning 
media together have a positive and significant effect on learning achievements through teacher performance either 
directly or indirectly in elementary school in Cluster I Ponre District Bone.

ABSTRACT 
Indonesia is known as an agricultural country, where most of the population work in agriculture. Agriculture is a field 
that has a vital role in the national economy. This research design is a survey. It conducted this research at the Central 
Mamuju District Agricultural Extension Implementation Agency (BPPP). This research is planned to last for 
approximately two months, starting from September 2019 to November 2019. Data collection was carried out through 
observation, interviews, questionnaires, documentation. The study sample was 100 people—data analysis through 
research instrument test, validity test, reliability test. Multiple linear is intended to determine the linear relationship 
between several independent aspects, which are commonly called X1, X2, X3, and so on, with the dependent part 
called Y. The results show that the competency variables and extension methods have an important influence both 
directly and indirectly in supporting the application. Integrated technology and increase in agricultural products, so 
that the existence of competency variables and extension methods need to be maintained, especially in increasing 
integrated technology and increasing agricultural products.

1. Introduction 
The extension is an important thing to advance the agricultural sector in Indonesia, which knows good techniques and 
methods to be accepted by the community. The extension is essential to be the community's dedication to advancing 
and improving agriculture quality, especially in Indonesia, where people still do not know about agricultural 
technology. It is essential to do counseling. The method that I use is to analyze all aspects that have become farmers' 
habits where it is a legacy from their ancestors so that understanding and application is easier and more efficient for 
farmers.

3726","understanding so that the target they want to achieve can be achieved perfectly, namely creating humans. -Human 
beings who are strict, intelligent, careful, have high integrity, especially in agriculture. These challenges can be the 
primary capital to provide excellent and positive thinking, especially in work, so that later human beings who are 
reliable and ready to enter the world of work are created the evaluation can be applied to the world of work in full so 
that each problem can be translated into lessons to analyze better. 
 
This study's expected results also support the results of previous research conducted by Diana Sulianti K. L. Tobing 
(2009). The conclusion is that there is a significant effect of increasing agricultural yields on workers' performance. 
Furthermore, the research method conducted by Novita Marlia (2010), based on the results of the study, it can be 
concluded that the increase in agricultural yields has a good effect on the performance of workers, so it is essential to 
apply this method to the management of the world of agriculture. The research conducted by Wanda Febriyana (2015), 
based on the results of the study, can be concluded that the increase in agricultural yields on workers' performance has 
a good and significant effect. 
 
The managerial implication of increasing agricultural products is the quality and quantity of work that the instructor 
wants to achieve in carrying out his obligations following the responsibilities given to him, namely by increasing the 
increase in agricultural output utilizing work, namely expertise. Required to do the job will increase or reduce the 
growth of farm products. Wages or salaries are the factor of fulfilling the life needs of extension workers who are 
deemed appropriate or not, work supervision. They are an excellent bosses/supervisor means that they want to 
appreciate the work of their subordinates. Then opportunities for promotion, namely factors related to whether there 
is an opportunity to gain career advancement while working and finally colleagues, are factors related to the 
relationship between the instructor and his superiors and other extension workers. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that the competency variables and extension methods had a significant effect both directly and 
indirectly in supporting the application of integrated technology and increasing agricultural yields so that the 
competence variables and extension methods needed to be maintained, especially in expanding integrated technology 
and increasing agricultural output. The competence and methods of extension workers can be used as a reference for 
farmers and related agencies to support and improve the professional performance of extension workers related to 
increasing integrated technology and increasing agricultural output. This study took the research object at the 
Agricultural Extension Implementation Center (BPP) in the Mamuju Tengah district. The objectives to be 
implemented can be fulfilled very well and satisfactorily. This integrated technology method is a crucial aspect of 
being better for farmers in managing crops and the results obtained. It can indirectly overcome malnutrition and 
poverty due to a lack of food. The plan is to prioritize farmers at lower levels who have received relatively little special 
attention so that the programs to be achieved are always not on target, with the extension method in increasing 
agricultural products through this integrated technology. It is hoped that the problems in Meet the farmers that they 
can shrimp paste and can have a positive impact on all farmers, especially farmers who are in the central Mamuju 
district of West Sulawesi province. The farmers received very positively about the times so that there were no 
significant obstacles in extension activities. Hence, increasing agricultural products using integrated technology had 
a powerful effect on increasing agricultural output.

1. Introduction 
Work environment and leadership factors play a role in work discipline and employee performance. In the above 
explanation, work discipline also plays a role in employee performance. Wibowo (2012) and Hasibuan (2011) state 
that the higher achievement motivation and work discipline is the employee performance will also increase. According 
to Sedarmayanti (2011), one factor that plays a role in implementation is mental attitude (work motivation, work 
discipline, work ethics). The mental attitude possessed by an employee will give a role in his account. 
 
From the research results, it can be concluded that work discipline has a significant role in employee performance. 
Furthermore, in Sumiati Paramban (2018), from the results of the research, it can be concluded that work discipline 
plays a significant role in employee performance. Physical environmental conditions, the current working environment 
conditions at the Office of Trade and Industry in Central Mamuju Regency are less comfortable. The environment has 
a narrow space so that in carrying out work activities, employees are not concentrated due to noise in the narrow room 
and make the room unheard. Then the workspace, in the workspace arrangement, is very untidy. Judging from the

3734","According to Subiyandono (2011), in strategic management for an organization that wants to develop rapidly, human 
resource management functions, leadership, work discipline, motivation, and organizational culture and work field 
must be combined. 
 
This study also supports the results of previous research from Danang Setya Ramadhani (2016), the conclusion that 
there is a positive role between leadership and employee performance. Furthermore, research conducted by Fenny 
Dwi Oktavia (2014), based on the study results, can be concluded that administration has a role in employee 
performance. Wijayanti undertook the research. Dwi Wahyu (2012), based on the study results, can be concluded that 
there is a leadership role in employee performance. 
 
Discipline is the awareness and willingness of a person to obey all applicable social rules and norms. Discipline is a 
mental attitude that is reflected in the actions or behavior of individuals, groups, or society, in the form of obedience 
to regulations set by the government or the ethics, norms and rules that apply in society for certain purposes (Mu’adi 
et al., 2020; Nawawi et al., 2020). Discipline can also be interpreted as self-control so as not to do something that is 
contrary to the philosophy of a nation / state. The definition of work is burden, obligation, source of income, pleasure, 
prestige, self-actualization, and so on. Work is the use of mental and physical processes in achieving several productive 
goals. 
 
The managerial implication of the work environment on employee performance is the quality and quantity of work 
results achieved by employees. In carrying out their duties following their responsibilities, they improved the work 
environment utilizing the work atmosphere, namely the conditions around employees who are doing work that can 
play a role. The relationship with co-workers, namely the association with co-workers, is harmonious and intrigue 
among fellow workers. Work facilities are available, namely the equipment used to support the smooth running of 
work complete / up to date, then illumination, namely light or very lighting. Great benefits for employees to get a safe 
and smooth job are to keep the place and work environment in a safe condition. 
 
This study also supports the results of previous research from Nathalia, Diansari (2016), the conclusion that work 
discipline variables have a significant role in employee performance variables. Furthermore, research conducted by 
Marsyaf Rinaldi (2016), based on the study results, can be concluded that discipline work has a significant role on 
employee performance. Then research conducted by Sumiati Paramban (2018), based on the study results, can be 
concluded that work discipline plays a significant role in employee performance. 
 
The managerial implication of the role of work discipline on employee performance is the quality and quantity of 
work results achieved by employees in carrying out their duties following their responsibilities. They increased work 
discipline by way of an exemplary leader. That is, the leadership has a good field so that subordinates also have good 
discipline. Good too, then remuneration, because compensation will give employees satisfaction and love for their 
workplace. The justice, namely justice, which is the basis for policy in providing payment or punishment, will create 
good discipline. Assertiveness, namely the leadership's firmness in taking action, will play a role in employee 
discipline. Finally, human relations, a harmonious humanitarian relationship between fellow employees, contribute to 
creating a good organization.

The work environment plays a positive and significant role towards work discipline at the Office of Trade and Industry 
in Central Mamuju Regency. Thus, it can be concluded that the work environment will maintain work discipline.

ABSTRACT 
It conducted this research intending to analyze and know the extent of the impact of the leadership style and the 
knowledge transfer process, the effect of leadership on strengthening organizational culture, and improving the Class 
IIA Sungguminasa Women's performance's Prison. Research has been carried out using a quantitative approach that 
uses a questionnaire to obtain information related to the study. It is then carried out data processing on the 
questionnaire distribution recapitulation using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) method with Smart PLS 3.2.8 
software. The leadership style adopted by this agency leadership has had a significant positive impact on transferring 
knowledge to employees and strengthening organizational culture but has not substantially impacted employee 
performance. The effect of mediation shows that corporate culture can have a significant impact as a mediating 
variable. In contrast, the transfer of knowledge has not substantially affected the influence of leadership style on 
organizational performance if used as a mediating variable. 
 
Keywords: employee performance, organizational culture, knowledge transfer, leadership style 
 
1. Introduction 
Employees are one of the essential parts of an organization. Without them, an organization cannot achieve the expected 
goals because they also determine an organization's back and forth. Every government agency is obliged to maximize 
the performance of its employees. Employee performance cannot be separated from the leadership which controls an 
organization, the process of transferring knowledge, and the organizational culture that is running. 
 
Mangkunegara, in research conducted by Razak Munir, Gunawan (2016) describes employee performance because of 
the work implementation process that has been determined both in quantity and quality. Furthermore, Sembe et al. 
(2018), in their research, found that the impact of a leader with a good leadership style has an excellent effect on 
employee performance. Subsequent research related to knowledge transfer and its effects on improving performance

or organization. 
 
Based on the results of distributing questionnaires which then processed the data from the respondents' responses 
using SMAT PLS, empirical findings were obtained that the leadership style had a significant positive effect on 
organizational culture. This shows that the current leadership style has successfully formed an excellent corporate 
culture among employees at the Class II-A Sungguminasa Women's Institution for Parenting (LAPAS). This study's 
results align with the theory put forward by Robbins in Riani (2011: 7), which states that organizational culture as the 
dominant values disseminated in organizations is used as the work philosophy of employees that guides corporate 
policies in managing employees. Therefore, the role of leadership in managing culture means trying to understand 
how the existing culture's strengths and its effects on organizational goals. Failure in managing culture considers 
individual behavior and works climate an integral part of the culture itself. This study's empirical condition shows the 
positive and significant influence of leadership style on organizational culture is supported by observations during the 
survey that saw the firm and disciplined nature of the Class IIA Sungguminasa Women's Prison leadership, which can 
be transmitted to employees as organizational culture. 
 
Based on the results of distributing questionnaires that then processed the data from the respondents' responses using 
SMAT PLS, empirical findings showed that the leadership style had a negative and insignificant effect on employee 
performance. This indicates that no matter how good the Class II-A Sungguminasa Women's Institute for Parenting 
(LAPAS) leadership style cannot have a significant effect on employee performance because employees have 
performed well even though the leadership often changes in a relatively short period. 
 
According to Kartono (2005), leadership is the ability to give constructive influence to others to make a cooperative 
effort to achieve the goals that have been planned. Leadership is the process of influencing one individual to another 
to achieve a common goal (Kreitner & Kinicki, 2008; Nuraini et al., 2019; Umanailo, 2020, 2019). Leadership can be 
defined as using power and influence to direct followers' activities towards achieving goals (Colquitt, et.al, 2009; 
Mu’adi et al., 2020; Nawawi et al., 2020). 
 
Based on the results of distributing questionnaires that processed the data from the respondents' responses using SMAT 
PLS, empirical findings were obtained that the transfer of knowledge had a positive and insignificant effect on 
employee performance. This shows that the transfer of wisdom found in the Class II-A Sungguminasa Women's 
Institution (LAPAS) research process could not significantly affect employee performance. Because employees 
already have essential competencies related to working duties and functions obtained during pre-service and through 
the training and education and training. 
 
Knowledge sharing can be defined as disseminating information and knowledge throughout the organization, as Ling 
et al. (2009) proposed. The term knowledge sharing can also imply the giving and receiving information in the context 
of knowledge by resources. Furthermore, according to Xue (2011), knowledge transfer will be a series of processes 
that occur in an organization with a role to maximize the performance of human resources. 
 
Based on the results of distributing questionnaires which then processed the respondent's data using SMAT PLS, 
empirical findings were obtained that organizational culture has a significant positive effect on employee performance. 
This shows that an excellent corporate culture at the Class II-A Sungguminasa Women's Institution can empirically 
have a substantial impact on employee performance. Because employees have a disciplined organizational culture that 
can be role models for prison residents, this culture will impact employees' performance. 
 
Darodjat (2015: 238) argues that organizational culture is a value that guides human resources to deal with external 
problems and adjustments to the organization. Each member of the organization must understand the importance that 
exists and how the brand should be. Act and behave to maximize performance. Widodo (2015: 131) further argues 
that performance is the level of achievement of results for the implementation of specific tasks, while Edison et al. 
(2016: 190) states that performance is the result of a process that refers to and is measured over a certain period based 
on the provisions or agreements that have been predetermined. This study also supports the results of research by 
Wahyuni, E. (2015), who found empirical conditions that there was a positive influence of organizational culture on 
employee performance, as happened at the Class IIA Sungguminasa Women's Prison.

3745","Leadership style has a significant positive effect on the transfer and organizational culture of knowledge, which shows 
that it will have a considerable impact on knowledge transfer and strengthening of corporate culture when the 
leadership style is getting better. In contrast, when related to performance, the influence of leadership style at Class 
IIA Women's Prison is not maximal. Knowledge transfer also shows a positive but insignificant effect on employee 
performance, which indicates that when the transfer of knowledge is getting better, it will not significantly improve 
employee performance. Furthermore, when the organizational culture is running well, the concert will have a 
significant effect. Leadership style has no significant positive impact on employee performance if mediated by 
knowledge transfer and has a significant positive effect on employee performance if mediated by organizational 
culture. Based on the research results, the suggestions from this study's results are for the leaders of the Class IIA 
Sungguminasa Women's Prison to pay more attention to good communication with employees. They take the time to 
provide direction to employees who can support the employees' performance and provide opportunities for employees 
to develop their knowledge-related field of work through training or opportunities to continue education following 
work. There are suggestions for further researchers to develop this research by adding other variables that can 
influence employee performance.

1. Introduction 
The demands for improving the quality of life are increasing as well. This encourages people's behavior to demand 
expanded services in daily life such as transportation services, shop services, and health services. Hospitals as health 
service providers carry out various innovations to improve health services as a preventive step in healing diseases in 
carrying out its responsibilities as service providers according to everyday needs; the government provides good 
services to the community such as health services. In this case, the government provides services to the community 
by providing health facilities such as health centers or hospitals. Puskesmas or hospital is one of the health facilities 
that are vital for the community. As a health implementing unit, the hospital must meet basic service standards, 
especially in providing protection such as feeling comfortable and safe for visitors. Hospitals must pay attention to 
service quality for service users' satisfaction, not just accommodating sick people. 
 
Quality is at the core of an institution's survival. The quality revolution movement through an integrated quality 
management approach is a demand that it cannot ignore. Consumers are looking for health services that can provide 
the best service to achieve satisfaction. However, providing the best quality service is a challenge for the hospital 
because it requires proper management (Yunari, 2017; Walanansendow, 2017; Tjiptono, 2012). This is because

3307","The results of hypothesis testing show a positive and significant influence between the Attitudes of Nurses and Patient 
Satisfaction at Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu, Bantaeng Regency. It can see from the t value of the Nurse Attitude 
variable towards Patient Satisfaction, which is 2.136 greater (>) than the t table 1.982 with a significant level of 0.000 
which explains that the value obtained is significant towards Patient Satisfaction in Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu, 
Bantaeng Regency. This means that the higher the Nurse's Attitude, the Patient Satisfaction will also increase in Prof. 
DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu, Bantaeng Regency, and vice versa nurse's attitude is low, the patient satisfaction will 
also below. 
 
The indirect effect of Service Quality on Patient Satisfaction through the Attitude of Nurses is 0.095. This shows that 
the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted or Ho is rejected, meaning that Service Quality has a positive effect on 
Patient Satisfaction through the Attitude of Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi. 
The results of statistical testing explained that the higher the quality of service, the patient's satisfaction through nurses' 
attitudes would increase in RSUD Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu, Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi. And vice 
versa if the quality of service is low, patient satisfaction through the attitude of nurses in serving patients will also 
below.

the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted, or Ho is rejected. It can interpret that health facility positively affect patient 
satisfaction through the nurses' attitudes at Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi. It 
can explain this conclusion that the higher the health facility, the patient satisfaction through the nurse's attitude will 
increase in prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu, Bantaeng Regency, and vice versa, if health facilities are low, patient 
satisfaction through nurses' attitude in serving patients will also below. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Increasing the quality of services and health facilities will show a positive relationship, namely, the better the effect 
on nurses' attitudes at Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi. If the quality of health 
services and facilities increases, the better the effect will be on patient satisfaction at Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar 
Makkatutu, Bantaeng Regency. From the results of the path, analysis can be calculated the value of the indirect effect, 
which shows the positive influence of the variable quality of services and health facilities on patient satisfaction 
through the nurse's attitude at Prof. DR. H. M. Anwar Makkatutu Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi. 5. Confession

Abstract  
It is evident how the pandemic has confronted the country with massive disruption in the education system, thus 
restraining students in all levels to acquire the knowledge and skills that physical school’s endeavor to deliver- opening 
opportunities for the development of digital tools. Students are compelled to acquire education through home-based 
learning where course contents are packaged into digital forms called courseware which are accessed by students 
through the LMS to gain knowledge and skills required of their discipline of choice. This study aimed to examine the 
insights of students who use courseware as their primary medium of acquiring education obtained using a descriptive 
survey method in the form of questionnaires. Undergraduate students of Pangasinan State University were the 
respondents. The computed sample size from the population was analyzed by getting the weighted mean of the survey 
results. The results showed that the courseware utilized by the students of Pangasinan State University through MS 
Teams has high impact that promotes self-directed learning - guiding students to learn independently at their own pace 
without assistance from others, fostering favorable learning environment/ platform also gained high impact hence 
moderate impact in terms of the learning growth of students with a grand mean of 3.44 which was described as “high” 
and interpreted as “impactful. Thus, it is recommended that the Instructors or Professors need to maximize the use of 
courseware to improve learning process consistently in order to achieve higher level of learning growth.

1. Introduction 
In today’s education system, learning tools should be developed in such as a way that students could learn easily, 
ubiquitously, and economically. There have been numerous developments of courseware that are used as tools for 
learning. Courseware is a learner-centered educational tool that aims to promote self-directed learning. It contains 
learning contents intended to attain the learning objectives of the course, various learning tasks to develop the skills 
required by the course and assessment methods to assess students learning growth. 
Many innovative tools are used as aid in the teaching-learning activities in different schools such as the group chat 
application, Facebook Messenger that is up to this date is being used by many students for communicating with each 
other and with their teachers. Social media, such as Facebook continues to be the technologies of choice and serves 
as medium for sharing information and work collaboration. Schools have sought to use new technologies such as 
Google Meet (Google, Mountain View, California) and Zoom (Zoom, San Jose, California).  
Customized forms of software are typically evident in the form of digital courseware and Learning Management 
Systems (LMS) are used to simulate classroom settings and facilitate academic discussions/ interactions. Learning 
management systems are often interconnected pre-existing technologies such as databases and digital libraries and 
incorporate features that meet the needs of faculty and students. 
All these abovementioned innovative tools have helped many Higher Education Institutions cope with the rapid 
changes in education delivery modes brought about by the pandemic as the new normal setting in education 
commenced.  
In mid-March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted the education system in the 
Philippines. The government placed the major cities to lockdown and ordered local authorities to take aggressive 
measures to restrict movement of people and control the spread of the said disease. Schools were no exemption to the 
suspension of their face-to-face teaching and learning activities in all levels and urgently made to shift to online

It can be gleaned that the Summary of Impact Assessment on the Utilization of Courseware in the New Normal among 
PSU students has a grand mean of 3.44 described as “high” and interpreted as “Impactful”. All variables of the impact 
assessment garnered a mean of 3.54, 3.41 and 3.38 which corresponds to descriptive equivalent of “high”, “high”, and 
“moderate”, respectively. 
Based on the findings of the study, the courseware utilized by the PSU students through MS Teams motivates them 
to learn independently, enhanced their learning process and contributes learning growth in the new normal over face-
to-face classes. However, it is interpreted that the Instructors or Professors need to maximize the use of courseware to 
improve learning process consistently through courseware in order to achieve higher level of learning growth. 
This study is said to be congruent with Galy, E. (2011), Rahrouh, M. et al. (2018), Verecio, R. (2014), and Karajeh, 
W. et al. (2016). These emphasized that the use of e-learning tools captures student cognition and engages them in 
learning process via technology, while increasing their need for self-directedness or working independently. 
Moreover, students showed and maintained positive attitude towards using courseware and LMS, enhances learning 
process likewise contributes to the consistent improvement in the ability to define and measure students’ attainment 
of educational goals. Further, these highlighted that educators should continuously examine the effectiveness of their 
pedagogical strategies and smartly apply technologies to enhance students’ learning.  
 
5. Conclusion  
The results have shown that students who use the courseware provided to them by their instructors and professors 
through the MS Teams, regardless of program they are enrolled in, have raised self-directed learning as they could 
take initiative regarding the content and sequence of learning, learn their lessons effectively at their own pace, plan 
for strategies to meet their learning needs, communicate with their instructors and eventually adapt what they have 
learned.

students’ learning activities and goals be more achievable as it is easy for them to learn and operate the MS Teams 
commands for it is mentally stimulating. Likewise, the courseware is organized and easy to access.  
The MS Teams promotes learning growth as manifested evidently through new normal modalities because it supports 
different strategies for learning growth. Further, the courseware enhances their skills, knowledge and abilities, allows 
them to plan, monitor and evaluate their own cognitive skills, and promotes self-paced learning as it can be utilized 
anytime, giving them more time for learning.  
Finally, continuous improvement on the courseware is anticipated to provide better learning experience to students.

Abstract 
This study aims to elaborate and analyze the model to improve performance that can impact the service 
quality of health workers in the Central Mamuju Regency. The independent variables used are talent 
management and knowledge management, which are tested to improve performance and improve 
service quality. This research was conducted in 2 (two) public health centres, namely Durikumba Health 
Center and Lara Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency. The sampling 
technique used was accidental sampling. 70 of 74 officers filled out a complete and complete 
questionnaire at the Durikumba Health Center and 45 of 53 officers at the Lara Health Center. The total 
final sample obtained was 115 officers. This study uses a correlational design with a quantitative 
approach. Data collection techniques with questionnaires and data analysis used are path analysis with 
Amos ver.25 software. The research results among variables such as talent management, knowledge 
management, service quality, and performance comprehensively show talent management as a variable 
that impacts improving performance and quality in service. The talent capabilities possessed by officers 
will create better account and quality. Good. Health workers show this with different talents who can 
provide sound output because each officer can integrate their strengths and complement each other. 
While knowledge management is another independent variable that also affects the performance and 
quality of Health Centre services, knowledge of health workers, especially midwives and nurses, is a 
measure of success in terms of performance and service quality. Doctors demonstrate this too, midwives 
and nurses and other health workers in applying their knowledge and mastery of technology, thus 
enabling them to better understand up to date knowledge and information.

Abstract 
Economic growth in South Sulawesi is supported by several resource sectors, namely natural or human resources. 
Human resources can be seen in the growth of the education sector. In contrast, natural resources are seen in the 
development of industry in the processing of natural products and natural products as energy creativity. As is the case 
in Pangkaje’ne Regency, one of the potential natural resources is the mining sector, including the cement industry and 
the marble industry, namely the use and processing of natural stone into valuable materials economic value. This study 
aims to determine and analyze complex competency and social capital on company performance through employee 
productivity at PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble. This research was conducted at PT Celebes Indonesia Marble, with the 
factory location in Barabatu Village, Labakkang District, Pangkaje’ne Regency, and mining areas in Bantimurung 
Village Tondong Tallasa District, Pangkaje’ne Regency. The data analysis technique in this research uses path 
analysis. The researcher wants to test the truth whether there is “the effect of complex competency and social capital 
on company performance through employee productivity at PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble. This study indicates 
complex competency and social capital on company performance through employee productivity at PT. Celebes 
Indonesia Marble.

1. Introduction 
Industrial growth in a region is inseparable from good economic stability and aspects supported by directed human 
resource management and proper natural resources management. This can be seen in the industrial world—both those 
managed by the government. And those operated by the private sector. 
 
The presence of PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble in Pangkajene’ne Regency and the Islands in the work area in 
Bantimurung Village and Bara Batu Village is a challenge for companies in terms of community empowerment in the

3748","capital affects employee productivity of PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble is also acceptable. The estimation results of 
the path coefficient of the influence of employee productivity on company performance show a relevant or significant 
value, a path coefficient value of 0.552 (positive), and a significance value (p-value) of 0.000 (less than 5%), so that 
employee productivity has a positive and significant effect on performance. In a company, the higher the employee 
productivity, is the higher the company’s performance. So the hypothesis states that employee productivity has an 
effect on company performance at PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble, acceptable. 
 
The estimation results of the complex competency path coefficient, which indirectly affects company performance 
through employee productivity, show significant results, the path coefficient value is 0.376 (positive), and the 
significance value (p-value) is 0.000 (less than 5%). Productivity significantly mediates the impact of complex 
competency on company performance. The higher the hard competency, the higher employee productivity, and the 
company’s performance will also increase. The hypothesis states that complex competency will affect company 
performance through employee productivity of PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble, acceptable. The estimation results of 
the path coefficient of the indirect effect of social capital on company performance through employee productivity 
also show a relevant or significant value, a path coefficient value of 0.197 (positive), and a significance value (p-
value) of 0.002 (less than 5%). Thus, employee productivity also significantly mediates the impact of social capital 
on company performance. The higher the social capital owned by employees, the more employee productivity will 
increase, and company performance will also increase. So the hypothesis that social capital affects company 
performance through employee productivity at PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble, also acceptable. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Based on the research objectives and the discussion that the researcher has obtained, it is concluded that: The results 
of the estimated path coefficient of hard competency impact on company performance show a relevant or significant 
value, a path coefficient value of 0.520 (positive), and a significance value (p-value) of 0.000 (less of 5%), so that 
complex competency on company performance has a positive and significant effect, the higher the employee’s 
complex competency, the higher the company’s performance so that the hypothesis states that complex competency 
will affect the performance of the company PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble, acceptable. The estimation results of the 
path coefficient of the effect of complex competency on employee productivity show a relevant or significant value, 
the path coefficient value of 0.570 (positive) and a significance value (p-value) of 0.000 (less than 5%). So that 
complex competency has a positive and significant effect on employee productivity. The higher the employee’s 
complex competency, the higher its employee productivity. So, the hypothesis states that complex competency affects 
employee productivity at PT. Celebes Indonesia Marble accepted. The estimation results of the path coefficient of the 
influence of social capital on company performance also show relevant or significant values, the path coefficient value 
of 0.452 (positive), and the significance value (p-value) of 0.000 (less than 5%), so that social capital also has a 
positive effect. Very meaningful to company performance, the higher the social capital owned by employees, the 
higher the company’s performance. The hypothesis states that social capital will affect the company PT Celebes 
Indonesia Marble; it is also acceptable.

1. Introduction 
Human Resources (HR) is the main factor in the organization. Whatever the form and goal the organization wants 
to achieve, it runs according to its vision and mission for the benefit of many people. Therefore, humans are the 
core of all organizational activities. The performance of its employees dramatically influences the success of the 
organization. Whatever the organization or company is always encouraging increased performance for the goals 
it wants to achieve. Getting high-performing employees in an organization is very difficult because of the many 
factors considered. The success of employee performance will be known through a performance appraisal system. 
Success in achieving organizational goals is not easy to get just like that because many factors can affect the 
organization's output or plans. Work ethic in an organization is an important aspect that needs to be considered in

3336","insignificant effect on employee job satisfaction. Work experience's negative effect on job satisfaction is seen 
in standardized coefficients beta by -0.039, meaning that work experience does not improve employee job 
satisfaction. The same thing if you look at the comparison of the calculated t and t table values, where t count -
0.292 < t table 2.015. 
 
Test F; Here are the results of simultaneous test regression with SPSS ver.25. The effect of work ethic on job 
satisfaction is positive. The findings are in line with the view (Nitisemito, 2001) that work ethic is a collection of 
positive behavior and comes from fundamental beliefs with high commitment and loyalty to the work paradigm 
as an integral part. (Keban, 2004) Job satisfaction is fulfilled when everyone can produce exciting work, is 
satisfied with the work challenges faced, appreciates the resulting achievements, is satisfied to get an award, and 
is confident with carrying out work responsibilities. Thus, work ethic has a relationship with work satisfaction. 
The results of this study support previous findings (Sumarauw & Timbuleng, 2015); the conclusion is that there 
is an influence between work ethic on job satisfaction. 
 
The influence of work experience variables on job satisfaction is negative. This study's results are not in line with 
the findings (Alfian & Reno, 2015), which state that work experience significantly affects job satisfaction. 
Employees' knowledge does not fully support their happiness at work; this is because their experience does not 
bring out their potential by the field of work they want to do; this is contrary to the opinion (Ucup Yusup, 2016). 
states that ""experience brings out one's potential. The full potential will emerge gradually over time in response 
to various experiences"". 
 
The effect of work ethic on performance is positive. This result is supported by the statement (Hardiansyah, 2017) 
that work ethic is dedication and devotion to a job with essential values. Employees with a high work ethic are 
shown from their behavior such as working hard somewhat, making the best use of their time, working hours, 
strong desire in selfless organizations, cooperation, respect for their peers. These results support previous findings 
(Muhammad Zulham, 2008), which concluded that work ethic has a significant effect on employee performance. 
Furthermore, research by (Hardiansyah 2017) found that work ethic positively influences employee performance. 
The effect of work experience on employee performance is positive but insignificant. This result is supported by 
Trijoko's (2008) statement that work experience is a skill and knowledge that individuals master by individuals 
from actions and behaviors they have done during a specific period. Through this experience, they become more 
skilled and proficient in completing work and duties as a responsibility. Repetitive activities can increase one's 
abilities and knowledge. Meanwhile, according to (Mangkuprawira 2007), performance results from employment 
based on the quality/quantity that a person achieves in completing his duties according to his responsibilities in 
an efficient, effective, and reliable manner. This study's results are not in line with previous research results 
(Wanceslaus Bili, 2018); in conclusion, it shows that work experience significantly affects employee performance. 
This study's results indicate a significant positive effect of work ethic on employee performance through job 
satisfaction. This can be seen from the indirect path analysis of work ethics through job satisfaction, which 
significantly affects employee performance. Thus, job satisfaction can influence work ethic on employee 
performance. Etos also shows attitudes. And someone's hopes. This is also in line with the findings (Hardiansyah, 
2017) and (Saputra, 2018) that work ethic positively and significantly affects employee performance. 
 
Work experience on performance through job satisfaction is negative, meaning that an improvement does not 
follow an increase in work experience in employee performance through job satisfaction. The path analysis of the 
indirect effect of work experience through job satisfaction positively influences employee performance. Thus, job 
satisfaction can impact work experience on employee performance. Still, after the total impact is carried out, it 
shows a negative value, meaning that after combining or adding up the effect's direct and indirect negative results, 
this relationship pattern becomes insignificant. 
 
The effect of job satisfaction on performance is negative. An improvement does not follow an increase in job 
satisfaction in employee performance if other factors that influence it are considered constant. This study's results 
are not in line with the survey results (Tobing, 2009), the conclusion that there is a significant effect of job 
satisfaction on employee performance. Furthermore, this study is not in line with Wanda Febriyana's (2015) 
findings that job satisfaction on employee performance has a positive and significant effect. 
 
5. Conclusions  
The research results and discussion is related to work ethic, work experience, and job satisfaction on employee 
performance. It can be concluded that work ethic has a significant positive effect on job satisfaction at the Regional 
Secretariat of Central Mamuju Regency. Thus, that work ethic affects job satisfaction. Work experience has a 
significant negative impact on job satisfaction. Regional Secretariat of Central Mamuju Regency; can be 
concluded that work experience does not affect job satisfaction. Work ethic has a positive and significant effect

1. Introduction 
The World Health Organization (WHO) or the World Health Organization in 1957 defines a hospital as a social 
organization. Its function is to provide curative and rehabilitative health services and to reach comprehensive family 
and environmental services. The hospital also functions as a center for training and biotic research for personnel Health 
(WHO, 2017). Because it is closely related to human life, hospital services are provided with severe professional 
consequences. The implementation of health services, especially in hospitals, is very much determined by the 
availability of health facilities that are well managed and strived to always be in good condition and usable. The action 
and continuity of health services, primarily medical activities, will always be guaranteed. In the implementation of 
health services in hospitals or other health service organizations, medical equipment is a significant supporting factor.

1. Introduction 
Employees' professionalism is determined by the level of employees' ability reflected through their daily behavior in 
the organization. A high level of employee capability will more quickly lead to achieving the organization's goals that 
have been planned before. On the contrary, if employees' level of ability is low, the tendency of organizational goals 
to be achieved will be slow to even deviate from the original plan. The term ability indicates the potential to carry out 
possible and impossible tasks. 
 
Additional Employee Income is an addition given to PNS associated with attendance and performance assessments. 
The extra income for civil servants is a function of government administration's successful implementation in the 
regions. It is hoped that the funds will come from efficiency/optimization of the Regional Government budget ceiling 
and the increase in regional revenue generated. (Minister of Home Affairs Decree 061-5449 of 2019 concerning 
Procedures for Approval of TPP ASN in Local Government Environments). Additional ASN Income, from now on,

3356","Job satisfaction is a positive attitude shown by employees towards their work to work happily without feeling 
overwhelmed by the work and provide optimal results for the organization, which can be realized if the employee is a 
professional in his field. According to Arens et al. in Kusuma (2012), the meaning of professionalism states that 
professionalism is the responsibility of individuals to behave better than just complying with existing laws and 
community regulations. Talking about professionalism reflects a person's attitude towards his profession. In simple 
terms, professionalism is defined as the behavior, ways, and qualities that characterize a domain. A person is said to 
be a professional if his work is characterized by a profession's technical or ethical standards. Professionalism can be 
defined as a person's ability and skills in doing work according to their respective fields and levels. Professionalism 
concerns the compatibility between the skills possessed by the bureaucracy with the needs of the task. 
 
The results of testing the fifth hypothesis show that job satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on the 
performance of Civil Servants (PNS) in the Environmental Service Office of Soppeng Regency, where the value of 
count is 5,712> t-table 1,984 with a significance value of 0.00. high employee job satisfaction, the performance will 
also increase, and vice versa. If the employee job satisfaction is low, the performance will again below. 
 
High-performing employees when there is a sense of satisfaction obtained, according to Mila Badriyah (2015), states 
that employee attitudes or feelings towards pleasant or unpleasant aspects of work are by the assessment of each job. 
Jobs that provide job satisfaction for the perpetrators are felt to be fun to do (Supriyanto & Machfudz, 2010). 
Conversely, unpleasant work is an indicator of a sense of dissatisfaction at work (Bangun, 2012). 
 
The Effect of Additional Employee Income (TPP) on Performance Through Job Satisfaction 
The results of testing the sixth hypothesis show that TPP has a positive and significant effect on performance through 
job satisfaction of Civil Servants (PNS) in the Environmental Service Office of Soppeng Regency. The value of count 
is 5,712> t-table 1,984 with a significance value of 0.00. This shows that If proper employees accept the appropriate 
number of TPP, then job satisfaction will also increase, as will their performance. 
 
The additional income will impact job satisfaction so that he is always motivated to improve his performance 
continuously. And according to the opinion of Supriyanto & Machfudz (2010), which states that a job that can provide 
reasonable job satisfaction to its workers, the job will undoubtedly be more fun to do. This is confirmed by (Bangun 
2012), which states that if the work is done and it feels unpleasant to do, it will also indicate dissatisfaction in carrying 
out its work. And the opinion of Tunjungsari (2011) states that job satisfaction is an evaluation that describes someone 
feeling happy or unhappy, satisfied or dissatisfied at work. 
 
The results of testing the seventh hypothesis show that professionalism has a positive and significant effect on 
performance through job satisfaction of Civil Servants (PNS) in the Environmental Service Office of Soppeng 
Regency. The value of t-count 5,712> t-table 1,984 with a significance value of 0.00 shows that the higher the 
employee professionalism, the higher the employee's job satisfaction and the higher the performance. 
 
Performance is the result of an employee's work by their responsibilities. This can be done if they have an ability or 
professional, which is supported by the level of employee job satisfaction and employees whose professionalism will 
show work results by the profession's technical or ethical standards. However, performance is also very much 
determined when employees always have a sense of satisfaction in their work, and according to Achmad et al. (2010). 
The latter says that the function of job satisfaction can increase morale, performance, and loyalty. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion in the previous chapter related to the influence of TPP and 
Professionalism on Performance through job satisfaction of Civil Servants (PNS) in the Environmental Service Office 
of Soppeng Regency, it can be concluded that the TPP factor, professionalism strongly influence the increase in 
employee performance (PNS). And job satisfaction. The provision of additional employee income (TPP) is more 
appropriate and fairer than employees who are following the workload and abilities issued. There is an appreciation 
for their hard work, of course, in doing their job. They will be more professional by working seriously and making 
various efforts to achieve a better work result so that its performance can be further improved. Of course, good 
performance will certainly be able to achieve organizational goals.

Abstract 
 
This research was conducted to determine the effect of employee work productivity on employee performance in the 
Sales Division of PT Mifa Bersaudara Meulaboh. The purpose of this study was to determine and analyze how employee 
productivity, how employee performance, and how much influence work productivity has on employee performance in 
the sales division of PT Mifa Bersaudara Meulaboh. This research uses quantitative methods with descriptive research 
type. Sampling was done by non-probabilty sampling method, with the number of respondents as many as 53 people. 
The data analysis technique used is descriptive analysis and simple linear regression analysis. Based on the results of 
the hypothesis test (t test), it was found that the work productivity variable had a significant effect on the performance 
of the employees of the sales division of PT Mifa Bersaudara. Based on the coefficient of determination, it was found 
that the work productivity of PT Mifa Bersaudara's sales division employees was able to explain the employee's 
performance by 68.8% and the remaining 31.2% was influenced by other factors not examined in this study such as 
remuneration factors and others. The conclusion of this study, the work productivity of the employees of the sales 
division of PT Mifa Bersaudara has been included in the good category, and the performance of the employees of the 
sales division of PT Mifa Bersaudara has been within fair category.

1. Introduction 
Company performance is the work that a company can achieve both qualitatively and quantitatively to achieve company 
goals (Fakhri et al., 2021). The success or failure of goals in the organization depends on how the performance process 
is implemented. Company performance is certainly supported by employee performance (Silvianita & Tan, 2017). If the 
employee's performance increases, then the company's performance will be good. Likewise, if the employee's 
performance decreases, then the company's performance is also not good. Employee performance is the work that can be 
achieved by a person or group of people in a company both qualitatively and quantitatively, under their respective 
authorities, duties and responsibilities to achieve company goals (Susanty et al., 2019). The success or failure of goals in 
the organization depends on how the performance process is implemented. From 2015 to 2019, only 2018 has exceeded 
the company's sales target, which reflects that PT Mifa Bersaudara's company performance has decreased. Declining 
company performance is, of course, in line with declining employee performance. The decline in the performance of PT 
Mifa Bersaudara in the sales division can be seen through unfulfilled targets. With superior infrastructure, quality coal 
specifications, and a broad market reach, PT Mifa Bersaudara's sales division should have been able to achieve the targets 
set by the company. 
Several factors influence employee performance, but in this study, researchers only discussed work productivity because 
one of management's efforts to improve performance is to support employee work productivity by providing 
compensation and encouraging employee work motivation. Employee work productivity is the ability of employees to 
manage and utilize resources to obtain optimal output in carrying out the company's tasks. Increasing employee 
productivity will encourage employee motivation so that employee performance will get better. Work productivity can 
also be interpreted as an ability to produce quality output by using the minimum possible input according to the company's 
standards. The decrease in employee productivity is also caused by several factors, the most important of which is the 
lack of foreign language skills in the sales division of PT Mifa Bersaudara employees. With infrastructure, quality 
products, and good production performance, PT Mifa Bersaudara should have achieved the annual target set, but in 
reality, this has not been achieved. Based on the description above, the researcher is interested in examining how the 
work productivity of employees of PT Mifa Bersaudara in the sales division.

3365","Of the 8 statements of work productivity variables, the one that got the highest respondent's response by getting a score 
of 75% and was in the good category, namely I took training to develop my abilities. This means that PT Mifa Bersaudara 
provides training for employees so that they can develop their abilities. Although overall the work productivity variable 
is stated to be good, there is a statement that gets the lowest respondent's response by getting a score of 63% and is in 
the fair category, namely my statement is committed to helping the company achieve its goals. This means that PT Mifa 
Bersaudara employees are committed to helping the company achieve its goals quite well. 
Based on the descriptive analysis results, employees' overall performance is in the fair category with a score of 67%. 
This means that PT. Mifa Bersaudara has implemented the four dimensions of employee performance variables quite 
well: quality, quantity, output time, and cooperation. Of the 10 statements about employee performance variables that 
got the highest respondent response by getting a score of 71% and it was in the good category, namely I helped my 
friend when my job was finished. This shows that PT Mifa employees work together in doing work. Although overall 
the employee performance variable can be categorized as fair, some statements get the lowest respondent with a score 
of 63% and fall into the fairly good category, namely the statement about the amount of work I do can be seen from the 
working time.  
Based on simple linear regression analysis results provided in table 1, work productivity variables have a 
positive/unidirectional influence on employee performance. This means that if the work productivity variable is 
increased, the employee performance variable will increase. Based on the statistical calculations results using the 
Statistical Software Program of Social Science (SPSS) version 26, the results show that the independent variable, namely 
Work Productivity, has a significant effect on employee performance.

Analysis of the Effects of the Prolonged Standing and Sitting Posture on Physiological 
Indicators, and the Potential Impact on Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 
 
Prolonged standing and sitting in the job environment are one of the principal causes of cardiovascular disease and 
musculoskeletal disorders. However, these diseases turn out to be just the results of sedentary postures and little has 
been analyzed regarding physiological indicators due to extended workdays. The main objective of this study was to 
do a systematic review and a meta-analysis using PRISMA strategy on the effects of prolonged standing and sitting 
postures in physiological biomarkers measured in work tasks, simulated workday activities and uninterrupted postures 
evaluated in laboratory. This study is intended to analyze different effects of prolonged standing and sitting in 
physiological indicators and its possible impact on human health due to these postures. A total of 46 studies for the 
seated posture and 29 for the standing posture were selected and included in the 95% IC meta-analysis. Results have 
proven statistical significance and reliable heterogeneity for the following biomarkers: Amplitude muscle twitch force 
indicator MTF (p=<0.001; I^2=0%), Mean arterial pressure (p=0.049; I^2=15.09%), Venous refilling time (<0.001; 
43.86%), Lower limb volume (p=<0.001; I^2=0%) for prolonged standing in healthy population and Lower leg 
circumference (p=0.031; I^2=0%), Triglycerides (p=0.007; I^2=15.57%) for prolonged sitting posture in healthy and 
overweight population respectively.

1. Introduction  
One of the most common ergonomic risk factors in the industry is staying in the same posture for long periods of time; 
these includes prolonged standing and sitting. In this context, it is known that between 60 – 70% of the European labor 
force spend more than 75% of their work shift in prolonged standing (Parent-Thirion et al. 2012). In the case of the 
United States, workers tend to spend between 50 – 70% of their day in one posture (Matthews et al. 2008). Office 
workers are exposed to 65% of their shift in prolonged sitting, which shows how common sedentary jobs are today 
(Clemes et al. 2014). The nature of sedentary work tasks corresponds to 43% of all jobs and is mostly found in the 
service industry (Brierley et al. 2019). 
 
Research in this area has focused on physiological biomarkers to evaluate prolonged sedentary sitting and reclining 
postures impact on the human body (Hwang et al.  2021). These prolonged sedentary postures, are mostly 
characterized as any activity with low energy expenditure lower than 1.5 metabolic equivalents METs (Young et al. 
2016). Physiological biomarkers have been considered as main cause mechanisms to cardiovascular problems (Jan de

Abstract 
  
Psychological aspects must accompany critical thinking skills to solve math problems well, one of which 
is self-confidence. Self-confidence is one that students need because they can understand mathematics 
well, learn mathematics without giving up and show confidence in their mathematical abilities. This study 
analyzes grade VIII students' critical thinking skills at MTS Manbaul Ulum Gembong with flat-side 
building material in terms of students' self-confidence. This study used a descriptive method with a 
qualitative approach. The population in this study were all students of class VIII MTS Manbaul Ulum 
Gembong. The sample used was purposive sampling based on high, medium, and low self-
confidence criteria for as many as 6 grade VIII students. The data collection technique used a critical 
thinking skill test instrument, self-confidence questionnaire, and interviews. Data analysis used 
triangulation techniques. This study's results indicate that in analyzing the mathematical material of flat-
sided shapes with 1) students who have high self-confidence can solve interpretation, analysis, 
evaluation, and inference indicators. 2) students who have self-confidence can complete the analysis 
indicators, evaluation, and inference. 3) Students who have low self-confidence are only able to 
complete the analysis indicator.

1.  Introduction              
Mathematics is a subject that is very important for students in learning at school. In the Regulation of the Minister 
of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia Number 54 of 2013 concerning the competency standards 
for Primary and Secondary Education graduates, it is explained that mathematics learning aims to make students 
have the skills to think in solving a problem, including the ability to understand problems, carry out settlement 
plans and complete mathematical models, and explain solutions that have been obtained. Today, in the learning 
process, students' problem-solving abilities become more developed, students are required to be active in teaching 
and learning activities. The involvement of learning activities increases the likelihood of students' learning process 
to think higher. 
According to Johns (Husnidar, 2014), if students are accustomed to distinguishing between true and false, facts 
and opinions, and knowledge and beliefs, they will practice their thinking skills. According to Johnson 
(Mahmuzah, 2015), thinking is a mental activity carried out by a person to help formulate or solve problems in 
making decisions according to what is desired. Critical thinking is a cognitive ability to make conclusions based 
on logical reasons and demonstrable evidence (Yaumi, 2012). Facione (in Akliamawati, 2015) states that critical 
thinking is the ability to do analysis, make conclusions, provide explanations and be confident about the thought 
process to solve problems. Mathematical critical thinking is the basic process for analyzing opinions and 
presenting ideas against each explanation to develop logical thinking patterns (Jumaisyaroh, 2014). 
In 2011 the Trend of International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) showed that Indonesia is ranked 38 
out of 42 countries with an average of 386 participants out of an international average of 500. Indonesia 2 is 
ranked 64th out of 65 countries in the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) data. The

Abstract  
 
The project consists of a 3D simulation of a supermarket using hypothetical data, which considers 
18 different types of arriving products that are split by types into 6 different stocks, each one 
receiving 3 types of products. Prior to supermarket opening, simulation distributes products on the 
shelves. Purchases are self-service and only cashiers are operated by attendants. Two cashiers are 
fixed and 3 operates when necessary. During the period of operation of the supermarket, operators 
will replace the products on the shelves to keep them stocked. Project was developed using 
FlexSim software.

Abstract  
.  
The simulation model was based on a real data of a layout in a Chemical Factory. The factory had bottleneck points 
along its system mainly because of the chosen layout, which had a lot of movement excess and had not a very 
justifiable reason for its arrangement. With the improvement, the factory was able to supply its annual demand. The 
discrete model was created in order to analyze the similarities between the simulation and the actual numbers found 
in the paper. The group recreated the layout of the production system and also the stock inventory in the Warehouse 
waiting for transport. The products are stannous chloride and sodium fluorsilicate. The factory receives raw material 
of the components everyday by an arrival schedule and, if there’s a problem with the material, it’ll be rejected. When 
they’re ready, each product passes through their own production sequence and then they are both carried by a fork-lift 
all the way down to the warehouse. They are now inspected (2% of rejection) and put on a pallet (each pallet receives 
8 boxes) to be placed on an 8x8 rack. The final products are now ready to be transported. At the end of the simulation, 
the results were close to the real layout proposal and there were no problems or bottlenecks identified in the model.

Abstract 
In order to offer the customer the opportunity to experience a differentiating after-sales service in the city of Quito, 
capital of Ecuador; a local automotive workshop introduces personalized service as a feat of professionalism, zero 
defects and quality. However, the improvement of lean post-sales processes through the DMAIC methodology has 
not been widely studied in the industry. This paper examines how to optimize processes in order to decrease the 
average service time of the workshop and increase the leanness of its activities and methodologies. Statistical analysis 
was used to determine the most relevant processes from the customer's point of view, with the support of the Contact 
Center database. Likewise, the circular DMAIC methodology was used with the support of Lean tools. The main 
results obtained show a reduction in time in the service process of the entire after-sales chain, a decrease in the waste 
of workshop supplies and / or materials and an increase in customer satisfaction evidenced in quality follow-up calls. 
Additionally, simulation and linear programming were applied.

1. Introduction  
In the automotive industry, specifically in after-sales service, the quality of service makes the difference between the 
success or failure of the entire firm. Generally, once a customer purchases a car, it will represent a single sale to the 
dealership. On the contrary, this same customer will return multiple times to the service shop for either corrective or 
preventive maintenance, so the profit generated by after-sales is greater than that obtained from sales; with the service 
market being larger than the sales market, generating at least three times the turnover of the original purchase during 
the product life cycle (Bundschuh and Dezvane 2003).  
Arroyo and Buenaño (2017) made an observation on the quality of after-sales service as an opportunity for the 
automotive sector in Ecuador and concluded that when a vehicle is sold, the brand acquires an ethical obligation and 
therefore is directly responsible for the customer service process, basing quality in service as a critical variable to 
increase competitiveness in the market. 
Furthermore, nationwide there are 29.068 economic establishments dedicated to automotive trade activities, of which 
70% correspond to establishments dedicated to the maintenance and repair of automotive vehicles (Pro Ecuador 2017). 
In this way, the after-sales service, apart from generating economic sustenance for the country, generates an important 
number of jobs with around 90.012 people (Arroyo and Buenaño 2017). However, despite significant market share, 
research on quality and efficient optimization in after sales processes has received less attention compared to efficient 
manufacturing (Arlinghaus and Knizkov 2020).  
Under the above context, the present study was developed in a company dedicated to the provision of maintenance 
services, repair; and marketing of automotive parts and accessories in the cities of Quito and Santo Domingo, Ecuador. 
The automotive repair shop is defined as a multi-brand shop catering to the automobile, sport utility vehicle (SUV), 
VAN and pick-up truck market mainly. In order to measure the quality of the service provided, the contact center 
conducts a telephone satisfaction survey. In the last year, several complaints have been received related to quality and 
delay issues, affecting the returnability of the customer to the workshop. Considering the benefits of Lean Service in 
similar industries, it will be used to achieve the objective of the study.

Abstract 
Every country has various socio-cultural conditions. Indonesia is a country that has socio-cultural diversity. 
Socio-cultural implementation is one of the mandatory competencies of the state civil apparatus. However, 
the measurement tool for assessing socio-cultural competence is still minimal. The purpose is to develop 
and validate the socio-cultural competency assessment software in the Indonesian state civil apparatus. The 
development of measuring tools starts with content validation through professional judgment and construct 
validation through exploratory factor analysis. The socio-cultural scale had good content validation and 
measured the unity of the nation's socio-cultural constructs. The validity coefficient ranged from 0.80 to 
0.90. In this research, the Socio-cultural Software in the setting of a Covid-19 pandemic. The loading factor 
of all items most correlated with a factor of 1 ranging from 0.535 to 0.779. The conclusion, the socio-
cultural scale is a univariate scale that reveals the unity of national socio-cultural. The total score on the 
socio-cultural scale obtained was higher, socio-cultural competence possessed by a state civil apparatus 
was higher. Future research can develop measurement tools in various settings and adapted to the socio-
cultural conditions of each country. The reliability of the socio-cultural scale also needs further 
investigation.

1. Introduction 
The global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic affects various aspects of life, especially in work. The socio-
cultural part is conceivably the one getting the most impact. Every country possesses different socio-cultural 
conditions. Countries managing information technology as a substitute for face-to-face work activities certainly do 
not feel significant changes in the way they work. However, for a country with a culture of gathering and working 
together like Indonesia, it may take time to adapt to current working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Based on the research results of Mensah (2019), it can be concluded that there is a significant positive relationship 
between socio-cultural values and job satisfaction. The most vital relationship observed was between moral values, 
religious values, and job satisfaction.  
 
Indonesia itself has a unique and diverse culture, not only within the scope of one country. Various provinces in 
Indonesia have diverse cultures. However, what is unique is that despite the differences, Indonesia is strongly unity. 
It is even stated in Law no. 5 of 2014 concerning the State Civil Apparatus (ASN; Aparatur Sipil Negara) states that 
positions of ASN consist of Administrative Positions; Functional Positions; and High Leadership Positions. 
Furthermore, the Regulation of the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform of the Republic of Indonesia 
number 38 of 2017 describes ASNs must have three competencies in holding their position. The three competencies 
are managerial, socio-cultural, and technical competencies. It shows the aspect of socio-cultural competence is very 
important as social support in achieving the vision and mission of organizations in Indonesia. Nazari et al. (2011) 
explain that both culture and climate play significant roles in developing management systems. The research findings 
of Mensah (2019) reinforce this idea that social support mediates socio-cultural values and job satisfaction 
relationships, sometimes fully and sometimes partly, depending on the particular socio-cultural values that are being

Rotated Component matrix of loading factor value of each variable. Loading factor is the magnitude of the correlation 
between the formed factors and these variables. Based on the table, it can be identified that all items are most correlated 
with factor 1, in this case the nationality belonging. Hence, it can be concluded that the socio-cultural scale is a 
unidimensional scale, so that the scoring can be totaled. The higher the total score obtained, the higher the socio-
cultural competence possessed by an ASN. This research is however limited to estimating the content validity and 
construct validity through EFA, so it still needs to be re-tested and carried out by Confirmatory Analysis Factor (CFA) 
with a larger and more representative sample size. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The assessment instrument for socio-cultural competence is content valid and is constructed from uni-dimensions 
presented online using a stimulus in the form of images about the socio-cultural case and is responded to through 
answers with levels 0 to 5. Suggestions for future researchers wishing to develop a similar instrument can use wider 
and representative sampling. Cultural differences are also a consideration in the preparation of scale items, so that this 
socio-cultural scale may be unused in different contexts.

Abstract 
The First 1000 Days of Life is the foundation for the afterlife in the human life cycle. Determination of the quality of 
human resources starts from the conception period to the age of two years.The purpose of this research was to develop 
family education in the first 1000 days of life as an effort to accelerate stunting with design of “school to parent” in 
Brebes Regency. The development research was designed through a preliminary study conducted with a qualitative 
descriptive approach to see the potential and problems that occurred, followed by a model development design and 
carried out design validation and design improvement, followed by a limited trial of the model design by applying the 
experimental method, continued product revisions and final product development. Based on the results, the model 
developed is declared very valid so that it can be used in the field; while the results of the limited trial show that the 
model is declared very practical and gets a very good response with a score. The effectiveness test is stated that the 
level of practicality is in the very practical category and gets very good response.

1. Introduction 
Childhood is a period or stage of age that determines the quality of humans at a later age. The critical period of a child 
occurs until the age of the first two years which is often known as the First 1000 Days of Life (HPK). The process of 
growth and development requires full attention from the family and surrounding environment because it does not rule 
out growth and development deviations (Borg & Gall, 1983). The incidence of stunting starts from the time the fetus 
is in the womb to the age of two years after birth. The long-term impact of stunting is physical and neurocognitive 
growth disorders. On this basis, stunting becomes a global health problem (A Rahmawati. et al., 2013). Inaccurate 
anthropometric measurements and the assumption that short children are natural are the challenges in overcoming 
stunting. In Indonesia, human resource development through reducing the stunting rate is included in the five national 
development priorities (Marchianti et al., 2017). Efforts have been made to reduce the stunting rate in each district/ 
city in the form of Ministry of Health programs and across Ministries. Sensitive intervention is a form of cross-
ministerial program covering food security, social networking, women's empowerment, maternal and child health, 
environmental sanitation, child protection and education in the form of classes (Djauhari, 2017).  
 
The highest prevalence of stunting in Central Java Province in 2017 was in Brebes Regency at 32.7%. In 2018, Brebes 
Regency became one of the districts that received direct intervention from the Ministry of Health. There were obstacles 
in alleviating stunting in Brebes Regency; one of which is the improper behavior of the community/ toddler's family 
in terms of feeding babies and children. This shows that parents have a big share in reducing the stunting rate (S. 
Nurkomala, 2017).   
 
The involvement of parents is already in the education unit with the aim that parents understand the abilities of 
children, can support student achievement and support the success of school programs. Parents are the heart of a 
family's life. The family described by Ki Hajar Dewantara is a collection of individuals who have a sense of 
unconditional devotion, for the benefit of all individuals who take shelter in it (Fitri, 2018). Family education is the 
process of providing positive values for child development for the next (Khoeroh & Indriyanti, 2017). On the basis of

3421","According to the Millennium Challenge Account Indonesia (in Djauhari (Djauhari, 2017)) stunting may occur starting 
from a fetus that is still in the womb and only appears when the child is two years old. Some of the causes of stunting 
are inadequate intake of nutrients that are absorbed by the body from the womb to after birth, lack of access to health 
services, access to clean water and sanitation. Stunting may also be caused by nutritional status of mother during 
pregnancy, a long history of short birth weight, a history of Low Birth Weight Infants (LBW), a history of 
breastfeeding, a history of complementary foods, maternal height, number of families, economic status, educational 
level and parental occupation, and parenting (S. Nurkomala, 2017). Supported by Agritubella and Delvira (2020), they 
also said that the causes of stunting include Chronic Energy Deficiency (CED) in pregnant women which was 17.3% 
in 2018 and related to anemia, as well as LBW (Low Birth Weight Babies) reaching 10.2% in 2015, social inequality, 
exclusive breastfeeding, parents' income and education, and maternal factors and parenting styles. 
 
The prevalence of stunting is closely related to birth weight and breastfeeding (Fitri, 2018). Breast milk increases the 
baby's immunity and lowers the risk of infection. The infants who are not properly breastfed are at risk of suffering 
from various infections due to insufficient and unhygienic diets. The provision of infant and child food greatly 
determines children's growth (Khoeroh & Indriyanti, 2017). One of the triggers for stunting in children under five is 
the low level of exclusive breastfeeding that arises from the past and has an impact on the child's future. Conversely, 
when breast milk is given properly by the mother, it helps maintain the balance of child's nutrition so that normal 
growth can be achieved. Babies really need breast milk in the growing stages for their nutritional needs to be fulfilled. 
Therefore, exclusive breastfeeding is mandatory until the age of 6 months which is then continued until the baby is 2 
years old  (Al Rahmad et al., 2013).  
 
At the development stage, a family education model was produced in Brebes District. The model used must be declared 
valid by the expert. Validity according to Nieven in Rochmad (2012) can be seen from the products produced (family 
education model product) and related products consistently between one another (material). Based on the validation 
value of the expert team, the developed device was declared very valid by the expert or in other words it could be used 
with a few revisions. Thus, the model could be used for field testing and could then be further refined based on 
suggestions and input from all components. 
 
The product of the family education model produced in this study needs to be known for its practicality. Practicality 
is the conveniences that exist in a product both in preparing, using, interpreting and storing (Arikunto, 2010). Products 
are said to be practical, which can be seen from the indicators of implementation (Nieveen in Subekti, 2012; Ervina 
et al., 2019; Rumaolat et al., 2019)). From the results of the practicality questionnaire filled in by the users in the 
extensive trial, it was stated that the criteria were very practical. This can be an indicator that the family education 
model is very practical to use. Besides, it is necessary to measure the level of effectiveness to be valid and practical 
learning device products. Effectiveness according to Akker in Rizka (2014) refers to the level that experience and 
intervention results are consistent with the objectives to be achieved. The indicators of effectiveness can be seen from 
learning outcomes, responses and motivation to participate in learning.  
 
First, the effectiveness was seen from the level of implementation in broad trials. The results of the broad trial analysis 
of the practicality level show a score of 82.31%. It means that the product is very practical to use. Second, the 
effectiveness was seen from the user's response. In this study, the product of the family education model received a 
very good response from the users with a score of 89.70%.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the research results of and discussion, it can be concluded that the school to become parents: a family 
education development model in 1000 HPK, was carried out through the following steps: defining, designing, 
developing and disseminating. The results of the expert and practitioner validator assessment show that the developed 
model is declared very valid with a score of 90.96% so that it can be used in the field. Then, the limited trial results 
show that the model is declared very practical by obtaining a score of 85.33% and gets a very good response with a 
score of 85.11%. The effectiveness test states that the practicality level of the model obtains a score of 88.32% in the 
very practical category and gets a good response with a score of 89.70%. The benefits of this research for the 
community is they can increase the motivation to synergize to reduce the incidence of stunting. Besides, for the Brebes 
Regency government can be used as a consideration in formulating stunting reduction policies that are in accordance 
with the needs and problems of each village.

Abstract  
 
The success of curriculum evaluation activities is determined by the evaluation tools or instruments used in 
collecting evaluation data. The absence of quality basic education curriculum evaluation instruments urgently needs 
to develop a good and quality curriculum evaluation instrument. A good evaluation instrument must meet the 
requirements of the instrument being valid and reliable. This research aimed is producing valid and reliable 
curriculum evaluation instruments and guides. The research method used in this research is development research. 
The data was collected using a questionnaire technique, namely the expert validation sheet. The analysis was carried 
out quantitatively. The results of the second phase of research in 2020 show that the results of expert validation 
show that from the aspect of content feasibility, the percentage of feasibility is 97.62% with very feasible criteria. 
The linguistic feasibility aspect obtained a percentage of 83.33% with Eligible criteria. Whereas in the presentation 
aspect, it obtained a feasibility percentage of 94.44% which means it is very feasible. This means that the curriculum 
evaluation instrument of this development is quality with this curriculum evaluation instrument, it is hoped that it 
can make it easier for education units, especially elementary school, to carry out a comprehensive curriculum 
evaluation.

1. Introduction 
Curriculum evaluation activities play an important role both in determining educational policy in general, and in 
making decisions in the curriculum. The results of curriculum evaluation can be used by education policy holders 
and curriculum developers in selecting and establishing policies for developing the education system and developing 
the curriculum model used. The results of curriculum evaluation can also be used by teachers, school principals and 
other education implementers, in understanding and fostering student development, selecting learning materials, 
selecting learning methods and tools, assessment methods and other educational facilities. 
 
Legal formal curriculum evaluation activities have been regulated in Law Number 20 of 2003 concerning the 
National Education System articles 55 and 56 which are then further regulated by the issuance of Regulation of the 
Minister of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia Number 159 of 2014 concerning Curriculum 
Evaluation. The issuance of the Permendikbud provides an opportunity to carry out curriculum evaluation activities 
in each school. In general, when discussing evaluation activities in schools it easily leads to learning outcomes 
assessment activities as a form of curriculum results, whereas ideally curriculum evaluation activities can be carried 
out on curriculum ideas and designs, curriculum documents, curriculum (implementation) processes, and results 
(impact). curriculum. The phenomenon of limited knowledge, confusion of understanding and the background of the 
competence of school human resources has resulted in a narrowing of the concept and practice of curriculum 
evaluation in schools which is actually very broad. 
The reality in the field also shows that schools do not yet have specific instruments that are used to evaluate the 
curriculum from various curriculum dimensions including curriculum ideas, curriculum documents, curriculum

that the assessment instrument material must truly represent all the material presented. For this reason, in developing 
an assessment instrument, you must use the syllabus as a reference for selecting the material for the assessment 
instrument. 
 
Practical, meaning that the assessment instrument is easy to use. Practicality is not only seen from the instrument 
preparation technique, but also for other people who want to use the assessment instrument. Discriminative, 
meaning that the instrument must be arranged in such a way that it can show the slightest differences. Specific, 
meaning that an assessment instrument is prepared and used specifically for the object being assessed. Proportional, 
meaning that an assessment instrument must have a level of difficulty that is proportional to difficult, medium, and 
easy. Meanwhile (Sugiyanto et al., 2015) say that an evaluation model is said to be effective or good if it meets the 
requirements: comprehensive, practical, economical, and is supported by valid and reliable data collection 
instruments, and has clarity of language. The assessment instrument must be accountable.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of expert validation show that from the aspect of content feasibility, the percentage of feasibility is 
97.62% with very feasible criteria. The linguistic feasibility aspect obtained a percentage of 83.33% with Eligible 
criteria. Whereas in the presentation aspect, it obtained a feasibility percentage of 94.44% which means it is very 
feasible. The limited trial results showed that the majority or 92% of respondents stated that they had good quality, 
7% were good enough and only a small part, namely 1% of respondents, stated that they were not good. This means 
that the curriculum evaluation instrument of this development is quality.

1. Introduction 
Cooperative learning models provide opportunities for students to communicate and interact socially with their peers 
to achieve learning objectives, while teachers as motivators and facilitators of learner learning activities. 
Cooperative learning can be explained from several perspectives, namely motivational perspectives, social 
perspectives, cognitive elaboration perspectives, and cognitive elaboration perspectives, motivational perspectives 
mean that the rewards given to the group will help each other. Thus, the success of everyone in the success of the 
group. This prompted each member of the group to celebrate the success of his group according to Slavin, Abrani, 
and Chambers. 
 
Successful cooperative learning can foster various aspects of children's development such as cognitive, affective, 
and psychomotor, with good cooperation between group members to get maximum results each member of the 
group will get their satisfaction, as well as improve the ability to communicate positively between group members at 
Homeschooling Carnation Cirebon. The learning model associated with improvement at each stage of learning and 
students' ability has improved in terms of communication, cooperation, and responsibility and is accompanied by 
conducive and effective learning activities, and according to, which explains that the application of cooperative 
model learning in improving learning achievement in citizens learning equality program package B. Cooperative 
learning models, the role of learners must be more dominant compared to tutors who are only facilitators in learning. 
The importance of this research is to maximize the cooperative learning model and aims as follows: (1) describe the 
implementation of cooperative learning models; (2) describe the results of cooperative learners; (3) knowing the 
supporting factor and inhibition in the implementation of the cooperative learning model. It is expected to increase 
the interest and become a relevant reference or reference for researchers regarding the implementation of 
cooperative learning models and provide evaluation materials for educators and institutions to maximize the 
implementation of cooperative learning models in Homeschooling as literacy education.

children and adolescents can affect their academic performance, attitudes, social and family relationships, and 
involvement in extracurricular activities. 
 
4.3. Supporting Factors and Inhibition of Cooperative Learning Model at Homeschooling 
Carnation in Cirebon 
The process of implementing learning certainly has factors that support and inhibit, as well as the implementation of 
cooperative learning models at Homeschooling Carnation in Cirebon has several factors that support as well as 
inhibiting factors. Based on the results of the study several supporting factors influence the successful 
implementation of cooperative model learning at Homeschooling Carnation in Cirebon, namely: (1) competent tutor 
and learning media    Competency tutor Siswanto, stated that the role of teachers, coaches, instructors, tutors is 
guiding, showing ways or ways to achieve learning objectives. 
 
The successful implementation of learning in the classroom is certainly fulfilled by competent tutors, tutor 
competencies become a supporting factor in the implementation of cooperative model learning at Homeschooling 
Carnation in Cirebon, tutors who can understand the characteristics, needs and development of learners in addition 
to the competencies of tutors who have creativity in managing and mastering the class so that learning remains 
conducive and maximal. (2)  Learning media, tutor competency is indeed one of the main factors of learning 
success, in addition to learning media in the implementation of cooperative model learning in Homeschooling 
Carnation is adequate both audio and visual such as modules, projectors, laptops and props such as globe and statue 
organs, so that the media is very supportive in the process of implementing learning. 
 
Based on the results of the study in addition to the factors that support learning there are also factors that inhibit the 
success of the cooperative learning implementation process at Homeschooling Carnation  in Cirebon, namely: (1) 
Characteristics and number of learners,the   main factors that become obstacles in the process of implementing 
cooperative learning in Homeschooling Carnation Cirebon is the limited number of learners only about 5-6 learners 
and unique student characters such as hyperactivity, spoiled, even become a trouble maker in the classroom 
therefore the challenge for tutors must give special attention to keep the class conducive so that the learning results 
can be maximized; (2) Open  class conditions,class conditions are actually quite good and conducive but there are 
some classes that are open, especially on the lower floors, which is quite disruptive for the process of cooperative 
learning in Homeschooling Carnation Cirebon because noise from outside can interfere with the focus of learning 
and concentration of learners so that tutors have to go the extra mile in the learning process and the learning 
outcomes are less than optimal. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Academic learning outcomes include: (1) cognitive aspects, namely students' understanding of the material; (2) 
effective aspects, namely being quite effective in fostering an attitude of responsibility, being able to appreciate 
yourself and others, the confidence of learners; (3) psychomotor aspect, judging by the activeness of learners when 
discussing and percentage. Furthermore, acceptance of individual differences has been well viewed by learners who 
can work with anyone. Meanwhile, the development of social skills of learners is quite good judging by the way 
learners discuss and communicate. The supporting factor in the cooperative learning model at Homeschooling 
Carnation Cirebon is the competence of good tutors, were tutors who can understand the characteristics of learners 
and creativity in managing classes, as well as adequate and supportive learning media.   While the inhibition factor 
in this learning model is the limited number of learners and the unique character of learners, and some classes are 
less conducive because the conditions are rather open.

Abstract 
This study aimed to describe the importance of instilling noble characters and nationalism to the children 
with special needs to grow their awareness and foster their characters and nationalism through the 
appreciation of diversity in their environment. Since many cases of bullying against children with special 
needs happened at school, the teaching of characters and nationalism was considered urgent to grow the 
values of tolerance, mutual respect, and patriotism. The idea could be implemented through simple 
activities, including by introducing the country, culture, and regional customs. This research was 
performed at four schools in Semarang City, Indonesia; in which the institutions admitted special needs 
children. It utilized a qualitative method through a case study approach. The findings revealed that the 
cultivation of character building and nationalism to the children with special needs was mainstreamed 
with the normal children. A couple of aspects were emphasized, especially regarding characters and 
nationalism according to their needs, such as responsibility and care to their peers. The cooperation 
among parents together with the institutions could develop support system in implementing the character 
building and nationalism values to the children with special needs. Teachers who are not used to work 
with the children with special needs might experience hindrance. So, they should enhance their openness, 
knowledge, and attitude to optimally adjust the education needs of those children. 
 
Keywords:

1. Introduction 
Education aims to grow and foster individuals’ independence, responsibility, creativity, knowledge, health, and 
noble characters (Istiningsih, 2016). Based on the notion, education accommodates the process of character 
establishment. The development of characters and nationalism currently is the core of education from pre-school to 
Higher Education level. It basically emphasizes that schools should not only deal with the transfer of knowledge but 
also character development. Rokhman mentioned: Education institution is no longer a place to transfer knowledge 
only. It is also a place to foster attitude, behavior, characters, and leadership. It is justifiable to reflect some basic 
values and characters of Indonesia and cultivate them to all young generation in the form of national character 
building through education (Rokhman et al., 2014). 
 
Character building and nationalism have become the concern of education process at Early Childhood Education 
(ECE) institutions. According to John et al. (2012), a number of countries exclude character education from their 
teaching priorities. Private schools are the active actors that perform the understanding as part of their institutional 
missions. Through the cultivation of characters and nationalism, Indonesian citizens are expected to fortify 
themselves from foreign influences and defend the country with its diversity. The number of children with special 
needs increases every year. The United Nations (UN) estimated at least 10 percent of school-age children had 
special needs (Harnowo, 2013). The increasing number of children with special needs each year requires ECE 
institutions to deal with the limited services for children with special needs. They expect a certain standardized 
curriculum for children with special needs in order to achieve the success of inclusive ECE program launched by the 
government by assisting teachers with proper programs.

negative attitude. It can also encourage them to nourish responsibility and discipline. Informant 3 said, “Parents 
rarely admit the lack of their children. It makes us confused. Kaisar is a huge challenge for us. We predicted that he 
got a psychologist, yet his parents refused to tell.” 
 
Parents and teachers have important roles in putting characters and nationalism. Schooling programs will be 
effective, as long as parents positively support their children. The relationship between children, parents, and 
teachers creates a connection between school and home. So, teachers can develop cultural awareness that children 
bring into the classroom to support their learning activities (Allen and Steed, 2016). Accepting the children’s 
conditions can be a key factor in setting forth the consistent implementation of character building and nationalism. 
 
Regarding the previous study about character building and nationalism of children with special needs, a substantial 
theory had been produced: The implementation of noble characters and nationalism should consider that children 
with special needs have their rights get equal education as the normal children, including for their learning activities. 
 
The findings revealed that the children education institutions in Semarang City are legally formal, even if they have 
not been recognized inclusive. However, they have admitted children with special needs and provided them with 
learning activities together with the normal children. Regarding the cultivation of character building and 
nationalism, each institution has rendered a number of services based on a cultural approach, in addition to a special 
program related to nationalism. Gunawan (2017) affirmed that an early reinforcement of children’s characters would 
positively contribute to their future and the future of their Nations. To achieve the target, proper curricula and 
schooling programs should not only prioritize cognitive aspects but also affection and psychomotor aspects, as the 
foundations of character education. Patriotism will also encourage them to respect and protect their national identity 
from the invasion of foreign cultures. They should be supported with activities that promote pluralism to grow their 
patriotism, such as through national anthems, traditional dances, and local cultures (Somitca and Stan, 2019). A 
support system from their peers will also protect them from intimidation. Cooperation among teachers, parents, and 
peers can foster their tolerance, friendship, empathy, in addition to prevent violence, as an attempt to create more 
secured and inclusive schools for children with special needs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
ECE institutions in Semarang City admit the children from diverse backgrounds, including the children with special 
needs. The implementation of character building and nationalism to the children with special needs should be 
endeavored through the inclusive ECE institutions.  Characters and nationalism reflect the unity that they have to 
foster since their early age. Children with special needs have equal rights of education as the children with the 
adjustment of learning activities based on their needs. The implementation of character building and nationalism to 
the children with special needs is more than just a responsibility for themselves. Parents’ support will facilitate the 
teachers to consistently proceed the proper activity programs for the children during at school and home.

Abstract 
This research is motivated by the lack of use of instructional media SBdP content. So far the teacher only uses student 
books and teacher books. In addition, students still think that the scenery is a mountain, as evidenced by data from 34 
students, 28 students draw a mountain when asked to draw a view. Therefore, this study aims to develop media design, 
determine feasibility, and test the effectiveness of the big book media. The type of research used is Research and 
Development with a development model developed by Sugiyono. Data collection techniques used test and non-test 
techniques. Based on the evaluation of expert validators, the material aspect was declared to be very feasible with a 
percentage of 98% and the media aspect was declared very feasible with a percentage of 89.41%. The effectiveness 
test uses the normality test in small groups to get the pretest and posttest values normally distributed because the value 
< . The N-Gain Test obtained a score of 0.696969697 with moderate criteria. Based on this research, it can be 
concluded that the big book media is feasible and effective to be used in SBdP learning material for drawing scenery 
of third grade students of SDN Tambakprogaten.

1. Introduction 
According  to  curriculum center of the research and development agency (Puskur  Balitbang) (2007) cultural arts and 
skills  (SBdP)  is  a  learning  content  that  provides opportunities  for  students  to  be  involved  in  various  appreciative  
experiences  and experiences in creating a work in the form of real objects that are useful for their lives. The aim of 
SBdP in SD according to Kristanto (2013) is to develop the ability to think, behave, and value for himself as an 
individual and as a social and cultural being.  
 
SBdP learning problems occure in the scope of elementary schools. Based on the results of pre-research conducted by 
researchers in class III Public Elementary School (SDN) Tambakprogaten through classroom  observations  and  
teacher  interviews,  it  shows  that  students  are  not  optimal  in understanding  the  learning  given  by  the  teacher  
because  of  the  lack  of  use  of  media  in learning. The teacher only uses learning resources in the form of teacher 
books and student books. In addition, another problem is the absence of SBdP learning media, namely a big book  
drawing  landscapes  for  grade  III  SDN  Tambakprogaten  students.  The  teacher  only provides  an  example  by  
drawing  on  the  blackboard  and  inviting  students  to  imitate  the pictures in the textbook.  
 
Grade III students at SDN Tambakprogaten are still independent or think that the view is a mountain. This is evidenced 
by data from 34 students, there were 28 students who drew mountains when asked to draw landscapes. Therefore, 
researchers developed the big book media drawing landscapes with many examples of landscape images so that 
students can  more  freely  explore  themselves  in  drawing  landscapes  freely  according  to  their  own creativity 
and can enrich students' mindsets or thoughts about drawing landscapes.  
 
According to Madyawati (2016), a big book is a  book containing images and text that are selected to be enlarged. The 
use of big book media to solve the problem of drawing landscapes  is supported by research conducted by Ivonne  &

Abstract 
The content of the Islamic Education curriculum is concerned with the emergence of radical ideas, which 
is represented on the theme of the caliphate and jihad from Islamic Education learning. The purpose of this 
research is to analyze the content of the syllabus of the SKI curriculum with the theme of khilafah and jihad 
in the State Islamic High School (MAN) curriculum to find innovative solutions to the concerns of the 
Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) against radicalism, so it is necessary to research the 
content analysis of the content of the caliphate and jihad curriculum to minimize student exposure to 
radicalism in State Islamic High School (MAN) in Semarang. The data were analyzed using qualitative 
descriptive analysis. The results of this study indicate that: 1. The contents of radicalism values in State 
Islamic High School (MAN) identified in the theme of khilafah and jihad were not found 2. Reconstruction 
was not carried out because none of the content of the caliphate and jihad themes were found 3. Extra-
curricular especially the agenda Mabit and spirituality have no potential for the emergence of radicalism 
and jihad or the formation of khilafah opinion, but individual teachers need to be aware of. 4. Analysis of 
descriptive content of the research syllabus is attached. It is recommended that officials within the Ministry 
of Religious Affairs (MoRA) of the Republic of Indonesia not be too Islamophobic to look at small 
symptoms to generalize about existing symptoms. This research is to be taken into consideration by the 
government before making decisions.

Abstract 
The current study investigated the role of work motivation and organization climate on the tutors' job 
performance. This research implements a quantitative method. Seventy-three nonformal education tutors 
of Sanggar Kegiatan Belajar (SKB) in Ex-Karesidenan Kedu and Semarang, Indonesia, participated in this 
study. The data were collected using three instruments, job performance, work motivation, and 
organizational climate questionnaires. Then, the data were analyzed using multiple linear regression 
analysis. The results revealed that the work motivation and organizational climate simultaneously emerged 
as the predictors of tutors' job performance. Independently, both factors had a significant positive on job 
performance. The tutor who has high work motivation would be more likely to increase job performance, 
whereas low work motivation may obstruct job performance. Moreover, the more positive the tutors' 
perception of the organizational climate, the more likely it is to improve their work performance, vice versa.

1. Introduction 
The implementation of non-formal education (PNF) is an effort to help community members who need educational 
services to function as a substitute, enhancement, or complement to formal education to support lifelong education. 
In this case, PNF provides opportunities for people who have not had access to formal education. Besides, PNF 
administering institutions also provide services for people who want to increase their knowledge, life skills, 
professional development, and community empowerment. The services offered by the PNF include life skills 
education, early childhood education, youth education, women's empowerment education, literacy education, skills 
education and job training, equality education, and other education aimed at developing the abilities of students (Law 
No. 2003 article 26 paragraph 3). Thus, it is hoped that PNF can be an alternative solution and support in overcoming 
the problems of developing the quality of human resources that formal education has not resolved. 
 
One of the forums for non-formal education is Sanggar Kegiatan Belajar (SKB), the Technical Implementation Unit 
of the Regional Education Service (UPTD), where it is located in the Regency / City. SKB as a non-formal education 
UPTD is, of course, required to carry out its function to become a professional educational institution. It will enable 
this forum to be in demand by all society members regardless of socioeconomic status through professional 
educational services. The functions and objectives of non-formal education can be realized if all heads of SKB, 
educators, and academic staff meet the qualifications as professionals who are educated and trained academically and 
receive proper academic recognition to integrate to produce quality graduates. This component is also the motor of 
the organization in carrying out the institution's vision and mission so that it is required to have good performance, 
especially for educators who are referred to as tutors. Pamong Belajar is Civil Servants (PNS) who have an essential 
and strategic role in the SKB because they have duties as executors and planners, and evaluators of educational 
programs. 
 
This is following the Regulation of the Minister for Empowerment of State Apparatus and Bureaucratic Reform 
Number 15 of 2010, which states that: ""The functional position of the Pamong Belajar is a position that has the scope, 
duties, responsibilities, and authority to carry out teaching and learning activities, program review and development

3470","0.294X2. If the work motivation and organizational climate are 0, then the performance variable is 16.727. The 
regression coefficient value of work motivation of 0.441 means that for every increase of 1 work motivation score, 
assuming a constant organizational climate variable, it will increase the performance score by 0.441. Likewise, the 
organizational climate regression coefficient value of 0.294 means that for everyone increase in organizational climate 
score, assuming a fixed work motivation score, the performance score will increase by 0.294. The predictor variable 
that has the most strong influence on performance can be seen in the standardized coefficients column presented in 
table 2.The analysis results show that work motivation has a greater beta value, namely 0.598 (p = 0.000 <0.01) than 
organizational climate (β = 0.366). ; p = 0.000 <0.01). That is, work motivation has more influence on the tutor's 
performance than the organizational climate. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of data analysis and discussion, it can be conclusion as follows: There is a very significant 
influence between work motivation on the performance of tutors in learning at SKB Ex Karisidenan Semarang and 
Ex Karisidenan Kedu; that is, work motivation has a positive and significant effect on tutor performance. Multiple 
linear regression testing results show this to get the t count of 7,737 at a significance level of 0,000 or a probability 
below α = 5%. This means that the higher the tutor's work motivation, the higher or higher the tutor's performance; 
There is a very significant influence between the organizational climate on the performance of the tutors in the SKB 
Ex Karisidenan Semarang and the Ex Karisidenan Kedu, this is shown by the results of the correlation analysis 
between organizational climate and the tutor's performance; it is found that a significant positive correlation. The 
calculation of multiple linear regression results gets the t count of 4.737 at a significance of 0.000 or a probability 
below α = 5%, which indicates that the organizational climate will affect the tutor's performance; There is a significant 
influence between work motivation and organizational climate on the performance of tutors at SKB Ex Karisidenan 
Semarang and Ex Karisidenan Kedu; this is shown by the results of the analysis using multiple linear regression 
showing that together work motivation and organizational climate have a positive and significant effect on tutor's 
performance. From the estimation results, the R-value is 0.812, the R square value is 0.659, and the calculated F value 
is 64.643 at a significance level of 0.000 or a probability below α = 5%. This shows that the higher the motivation and 
organizational climate to increase work motivation and organizational climate, the higher the level of performance of 
the tutors.

Abstract 
 
Grit is a personality trait that affects human attitudes and behavior in various contexts. Researches 
showed that Grit is a significant predictor of a person's success, both in education and occupation. Grit 
consists of the consistency of interest and perseverance. The purpose of this study is to describe Grit in 
university students. The instrument of this study is the Grit Scale based on Duckworth Theory. The 
participants of this research are 354 students in the city of Semarang. We used a cluster random sampling 
technique to select the participants of the study. We used descriptive statistics in JASP. The results show 
that 23,17% of students on the high Grit level, 65,5% of students at a moderate level, and 11,3% on a low 
level. The implication of this study will be discussed further in this article.

1. Introduction  
Individuals need success to achieve a good quality of life. Success can be achieved by being consistent with interest 
and persevering towards achieving goals (Angela L. Duckworth et al., 2007; Oriol et al., 2017). Working hard, 
persevering, and striving to achieve long-term goals, maintaining interest is proven to be a successful person 
(Dweck, 2006; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). Grit consists of Consistency of interest and persistence in achieving 
long-term goals (A. Duckworth & Gross, 2014; Angela L. Duckworth et al., 2007; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014; 
Vazsonyi et al., 2019). Gritty individuals will set goals and pursue these targets despite experiencing various 
challenges and several failures. Gritty individuals are also willing to devote more significant effort and attention to 
achieving the goals they have set (Kalia et al., 2019; Silvia et al., 2013). 
 
However, a study in Indonesia shows that 86.3% of students have low grit degrees, and 13.7% have high grit (Nora 
Izaach, 2017). The research results by Caesari, Listiara & Ariati (2013) show that low grit has an impact on student 
organizations' academic performance. Students prefer completing organizational assignments rather than academic 
assignments, preferring to complete assignments at the end of time, always cheat on friends' assignments, and often 
skip class (Caesari et al., 2013). 
 
A gritty person can keep the focus, endure adversity, and persist in achieving his goals. People with high grit will be 
more able to achieve academic success, the ability to survive in a career, and the ability to maintain a marriage 
(Angela L. Duckworth et al., 2007; Egalite et al., 2016; Lucas et al., 2015). 
According to the previous study, students must have high grit. Even if student organizations have many activities 
outside of the academic process, their grit will encourage them to continue to survive and succeed in achieving 
academic achievements. 
 
The results showed that grit has a positive correlation with student academic achievement (Alaoui & Fons-rosen, 
2017; Amalia, D. Irna, Aviani, 2018). Research by Duckworth et al. (2007) showed a positive relationship between 
grit and academic success, retention of cadets in rigorous military training programs, and student rankings in 
national spelling competitions. Grit also has an essential effect on student achievement levels, student engagement, 
retention, and graduation probability (Angela Lee Duckworth & Quinn, 2009; Maddi et al., 2012; Strayhorn, 2014).

3481","Based on table 2, we can conclude that 11,3% of college students are at a low level of academic grit, 65.53% of 
college students are at a moderate level of academic grit, and 23,17% of college students are at a high level of 
academic grit. Furthermore, the researcher conducted further analysis on each component of the grit.  
 
The results of measuring the academic grit variable show that the academic grit of students who participate in the 
organization is in the medium category. It means that students have consistency of interest and persistence in 
achieving long-term goals despite experiencing obstacles and difficulties (Angela L. Duckworth et al., 2007; Angela 
Lee Duckworth & Quinn, 2009; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). This result is in line with the results of the additional 
analysis on each of the grit components. Additional analysis results show that college students' level of consistency 
of interest and perseverance is moderate. The results of this study are different from the results of previous studies 
(Vivekananda, 2017).

da research (2017) participants were medical students, one of Indonesia's most popular majors. It explains that 
students who choose to study medicine will have a high consistency of interest. Besides that, the medical department 
is one of the most challenging departments. It has implications for the perseverance of efforts to complete academic 
tasks. This explains why the results of Vivekananda's (2017) study show that the grit level of medical students is at a 
high level. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Several things affect the level of grit in a person. Previous research results state that mindset and personality are one 
of the factors that affect grit (Angela L. Duckworth et al., 2007; Reed et al., 2013; Yeager & Dweck, 2012). There 
was a significant positive relationship between grit and mindset in students (Ryan, 2015). Students with a growth 
mindset are individuals who believe in the potential to develop with increasingly difficult challenges. They believe 
in achieving the goal by learning anything. The learning process will encounter challenges and difficulties. 
However, a growth mindset makes someone believe in overcoming the challenge with effort and perseverance. A 
growth mindset has a focus on the learning process, not on the drive to be smart. When experiencing failure, they 
look for strategies and solutions, ask for help from others when needed (Dweck & Yeager, 2019; Yeager & Dweck, 
2012).

Abstract 
This study aims to see the flexibility and capability of regional heads in carrying out their governance performance in 
serving public problems after becoming elected heads. Research. This research methodology is a quantitative method 
with the population of Palembang City which is spread over 16 Districts and 107 Sub-Districts and taken according 
to the existing regulations. The research findings explain that in Palembang, regional heads have autonomous rights 
to develop their own regions. This is in accordance with the local government administration system in Indonesia. 
Regional Autonomy is implemented based on the principle of decentralization in the form of a broad, real, and 
responsible autonomy. In the framework of implementing such broad, real and responsible autonomy, the regional 
head has a very strategic role in the field of governance, development and community service and is fully responsible 
for the running of regional government. This study tries to identify some formulations of the level of electability and 
capability of regional heads before and after regional development contestation. 
 
Keywords: ocal Government, Capability, Sustainable Development 
 
1. Introduction 
The aim of regional government is to better implement the principles of democracy, community participation, equity 
and justice and to pay attention to the potential and diversity of the region. Thus it can be interpreted that regional 
autonomy is expected to prosper the people and revive democracy which is reflected in the program, performance and 
figure of a directly elected regional head. In a democratic government system, the role and ability of the Regional 
Head in running the government is the most important element in addition to other elements. This ability also concerns 
the ability to make pro-community policies. This is in line with the fulfillment of sovereignty or power in the hands 
of the people. It is the people who are sovereign and at the same time the main owner of this supreme power within 
the framework of a democratic system. Glass and Newig (2019) explains that the difference between a democratic 
system to achieving democratic system, such authority and power are built and maintained based on the agreement of 
the people. Thus, democracy can only work if the achievement of goals in society is carried out by the Regional 
Government of the regional legislature in an aspirational and transparent manner. The importance of democracy is 
also strengthened by democratic activities. The essence of democracy, as expressed by Lionardo et al. (2020a); 
Zhuravleva (2015) is a process of deepening democracy that has benefits for the continuity of government and society.

3488","In the agricultural sector, it is necessary to optimize the Corporate Social Responsibility program from an area that 
has the potential for a company to be developed into a satellite city for the city of Palembang. Public welfare needs to 
be improved by targeting the development of natural resources, one of which is the agricultural sector. The 
development and fostering of farmer groups in this region is a vital issue for candidate candidates to raise. The 
agricultural sector is a central issue that has the potential to be developed, considering the characteristics of areas 
located in the suburbs where some of the people work as farmers, this can be developed by providing assistance with 
seeds, farming equipment and counseling on agriculture. So that it can improve the economy of the people in the 
region. The solution to revitalizing agricultural irrigation canals can be the main option that can be done as well as a 
medium for public policy for the community. Thus the economic development program has become a priority issue, 
the characteristics of the area close to the Musi river flow are a very suitable place as well as a fish farming area that 
has the potential for community economic development, it is predicted that the community will enthusiastically accept 
this development program. The economy in the agriculture and fisheries sectors will be a strategic policy indicator for 
regional heads to realize. 
 
5. Conclusion 
From the results of the data analysis, it can be concluded that the indicators of the electability and capability of a 
regional head are largely determined by the ability to overcome public problems that are happening in the community. 
The mayor's capability is considered good when he has the capacity to become a public leader armed with experience 
so as to attract public sympathy. Regional heads must also have great competence, experience in politics and 
government, making their popularity and capacity believed to be capable of making superior public policies. 
Meanwhile, the low electability in each sub-district shows the lack of seriousness in developing the region by 
answering issues that arise such as the need for economic development programs for farmer groups, infrastructure 
development solutions to deal with flood problems as a priority, routine environmental hygiene programs and 
provision of adequate sanitation facilities. so that trash is not littered. Another thing that is no less important at this 
time is the ability to overcome raising agricultural issues, infrastructure development for solutions to flood problems 
as a priority program that is delivered to the community and for other candidates who still do not have electability in 
this region, they must conduct more intensive socialization by offering solutions. to the problems faced by the 
community as a priority program. 
 
Electability must be built by realizing adequate sanitation facilities so that the provision of assistance in making large 
trash bins placed in various strategic places in this district is a solution that can be done to overcome this problem. In 
the riverside area, the need for regional settlement arrangement, assistance for the construction of school buildings 
and construction of clean water installations can be a solution in this area. Electability will strengthen regional heads 
who are able to create clean residential areas based on public health, maintain security stability, and programs related 
to infrastructure, including school construction, roads, waste management, health and security for several areas 
mentioned above.

Abstract 
Introduction. Swimming is a sport much favored by many, and one needs to have the courage to be able to swim. In 
swimming lessons in schools, there are still many students who are afraid to swim for fear of drowning and other 
reasons. The key to be able to swim is being able to float. Purpose. This research is to improve the learning ability to 
swim through a learning model using rope as aid. Based on the results of research and discussion, we can conclude 
that there is an improvement in the swimming learning process with the aid of a rope. Improvement in the learning 
through the method of swimming using rope as aid performed by the students of the State University of Sriwijaya, 
Palembang can be seen from their improved learning process and participation. Method. The research using qualitative 
method. The total of the population is 82 students in this class, 23 students could not swim and are afraid to carry out 
activities such as gliding, dipping heads and diving in shallow areas. Conclusion. There is a significant improvement 
in the outcomes of three learning cycles that have been prepared, such as the students apply the learning method of 
floating with rope as aid; cycle two, in which they swim using rope as aid, and cycle three, in which they make 
swimming motions freely without any aid. Change takes place in the application of swimming method using rope as 
aid in which students who initially could not swim can eventually swim.

1. Introduction 
Swimming is a sport that is high in demand by children, youth, adults, and the elderly. To be able to swim, one needs 
courage and an outdoor swimming facility. There are still many children who are afraid to swim because of fear of 
drowning and others. The primary key to swimming is the ability to float. When someone is able to float, he/she can 
easily make swimming movements. If a child spends most  time learning how to float in a shallow pool, they will need 
a longer time to be able to float in his/her own ways (Burac, 2015). Swimming needs courage. For beginners, it is 
extremely difficult for them in practice, due to lack of confidence in doing so. The causes of fear to swim are among 
others lack of area to play with water, and having no experience being in unpleasant circumstances such as choking 
or drowning, even simply swimming up to the nose in the water. To overcome all these fears and solve the problems, 
a teaching method is needed (Kirgios et al., 2020; Nasirin et al., 2020) A tool to instill confidence is important for 
beginners and is the main thing in their swimming learning process. 
 
To overcome all the fears and problems above, one needs to perform gradual habituation ways. This is done by initially 
letting the kids just soak their feet or splash in the pool while still wearing bathing suits. They can also be registered 
to a masterfully-handled swimming club, or simply ask them to take swimming lessons together with their 
relatives/friends of his age. Accompanying them will undoubtedly build their confidence that swimming is fun and 
that nothing to be afraid of. This method is often applied by many people or experts. Introducing them to water as 
early preparation for learning to swim should be done to those who want to learn swimming with the aim of preparing

3495","The results show that there has been an improvement in the learning process, from opening until closing motion in the 
learning of basic swimming with the learning methods of using rope as an aid. This is evidenced by the significant 
improvement in the learning process during their treatment in the activities of the learning process in three cycles. The 
lecturers are able to motivate students to participate in the learning activities to swim with the help of a rope. According 
to Lionardo and Nasirin (2020), the leader must be able to manage the class well so that the learning activities can be 
controlled the competencies and the faculty was able to create a fun atmosphere of learning activities for students, so 
they were enthusiastic in participating in the learning process with the help of rope. 
 
There is a significant improvement in the third cycle that has been collated in such a way, from the cycle of the given 
method of learning to float with the help of a rope, cycle two, namely the learning method of swimming with the use 
of a string and cycle three in which the students perform swimming movements by themselves without aided by a 
rope. After the swimming learning method with the help of yarn, the students who initially could not swim can, in the 
end, swim. In addition, the results of this study also show a significant improvement in the third cycle that has been 
collated in such a way, from the process of the given method of learning to float with the help of a rope, cycle two, 
namely the learning method of swimming with the use of a rope and cycle three in which the students move in the 
pool by themselves without help of rope. After the swimming learning method with string, students who initially could 
not swim in the end can swim. 
  
5. Conclusions 
Based on the results of research and discussion, we can conclude that there is an improvement in the learning process 
with the help of the rope pool. Improved learning through the learning method of swimming with the help of ropes by 
students of the University of Sriwijaya, can be seen from their improvement in the learning process and increased 
student participation. There is a significant improvement in the learning outcome of the third cycle that has been 
collated in such a way, from the cycle of the given method of learning to float with the help of a rope, cycle two, 
namely the learning method of swimming with the help of a rope and cycle three in which the students do swimming 
motions with the aid themselves without a leash. After the swimming learning method with the help of rope, the 
students who initially could not swim in the end can swim. Based on the conclusion above, the author suggests the 
following: 1. The approach of learning through the teaching method of using rope as aid needs to be explored for more 
learning, so researchers are more interested in developing their creativity to create innovation in the delivery of 
learning. 2. Promoting students’ physical activity needs support from various parties, including the elderly, and 
education providers. 3. The learning method with the help of a rope pool is expected to be applied to universities 
throughout Indonesia.

Abstract 
This paper aims to analyze social capital associated with the implementation of general elections in Indonesia in 
2019. The social capital in question is how the trust, network and norms held by the community, election 
participants, and election administrators in carrying out general elections based on honesty and justice. A hot 
issue that has developed in the community during the 2019 general elections in Indonesia is the impartiality or 
partiality of the election organizers, namely the General Election Commission of the Republic of Indonesia 
(KPU RI) and the General Election Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu). As a result, many Indonesians doubt the 
performance of the Indonesian KPU and Bawaslu. Even stereotypes that appear in society can cause division or 
disintegration of the nation and this must be avoided. So a solution is needed that always prioritizes the value of 
togetherness, advances together, creates love, and nurtures one another among the community, election 
participants, and election organizers so that there is no division in society. 
 
Keywords: Social Capital, Silih Asah, Silih Asih, Silih Asuh. 
 
1. Introduction 
The implementation of general elections (elections) in Indonesia in 2019 is different from the elections that have 
been held previously. In the past, the implementation of the presidential and vice presidential elections was held 
after the legislative elections. However, in 2019 the elections were held simultaneously. The 2019 elections 
were based on the decision of the Constitutional Court (MK) to issue a Judicial Review Decision on Law 
Number 42 of 2008 which was petitioned by Effendi Ghazali and the Coalition of People for Concurrent 
Elections, in a numbered 14/PUU-XI/2013 decision partially granted the petitioner's petition to cancel Article 3 
Paragraph 5 concerning the implementation of the presidential election after the legislative election, Article 12 
Paragraph 1 and 2 concerning the ability of political parties to announce who their presidential candidate pair is 
in the legislative election campaign, Article 14 Paragraph 2 regarding the registration period for presidential 
candidates after the determination of the legislative election results and Article 112 concerning the 
implementation of the presidential and vice-presidential elections after the determination of the results of the 
legislative election. 
 
In the 2019 election, there were two pairs of candidates for president and vice president, namely candidate pair 
number 01 and candidate pair number 02. Candidate pair number 01, namely Jokowi and KH. Ma'ruf Amin, of 
which Jokowi is the incumbent candidate. Meanwhile, the candidate pair for monor sequence 02 are Prabowo 
Subianto and Sandiaga Salaudin Uno. 
 
Fourteen (14) political parties who passed the verification results at the KPU and declared as participants in the 
2019 election. Prior to the implementation of the election, the Indonesian KPU has also determined the serial 
number of political party participants participating in the 2019 elections, namely (1)  Kebangkitan Bangsa

if it is based on the noble cultural values of the nation itself, not the culture of other nations. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In connection with the context of the 2019 election which is related to social capital is to see how social capital 
can work and be understood by election organizers so that the public trusts them and does not doubt their 
credibility and performance because they uphold the principles of honesty and fairness in elections. However, 
the expectations of the public do not match the reality on the ground that there is a vicious and dirty game in the 
2019 elections. The public knows these games from various sources of information and news spread by 
electronic media and print media. As a result, it creates stereotypes in society that can lead to division and 
integration of the Indonesian nation. To avoid national division and integration, it is necessary to have a solution 
that must be provided and supported by the government and election administrators. By borrowing a term or 
proverb from the Sundanese, namely silih asah, silih asih, silih asuh. Through this proverb, it is hoped that the 
Indonesian people, both voters and participants or election contestants, even though they have different choices, 
always prioritize the value of togetherness, namely advancing together in intellect (silih asah), the power of love 
that is always created in all forms of individual relationships with each other (silih asih), and an attitude of 
protecting one another as an inseparable part of creating a harmonious life (silih asuh).

Abstract 
It is time for state servants to provide services to society in a professional, honest, fair and equitable manner in carrying 
out state, government and development tasks. This study aims to realize the attitude of state servants who must be 
neutral from the influence of all political groups and parties and not be discriminatory in providing services to the 
community. In the legal and governmental aspects, bureaucratic reform is a very strong issue to be realized. The 
methodology used in this research is descriptive qualitative with an effort to explain the phenomena in the field related 
to the Indonesian government bureaucracy which is suspected to have contributed greatly to the occurrence of various 
public service crisis management. The findings of this study indicate that there is a bureaucratic culture that is thick 
with bureaucratic politicization and the lack of transparency in public services. The mainactor  public services  has 
not prioritized fair service to the community. Therefore, bureaucratic reform is expected to be corrective measures 
against the Government's political policies so that bureaucratic neutrality occurs.

1. Introduction 
One of the fundamental steps of bureaucratic reform, the Government has established a new policy in the development 
of the State Civil Apparatus as part of the Civil Service, which in principle directs the political attitude of the State 
Civil Apparatus from previously having to support certain political groups to become neutral or impartial, which is 
then commonplace. is called the policy of political neutrality of the State Civil Apparatus. The implementation of 
policies and management of the State Civil Apparatus is based on the principles of legal certainty, professionalism, 
proportionality, integrity, delegation, neutrality, accountability, effectiveness and efficiency, openness, non-
discrimination, unity and integrity, justice, equality and welfare. State Civil Apparatus is prohibited from becoming 
members and / or administrators of political parties. State Civil Apparatus who are members and / or administrators 
of political parties must be dismissed as State Civil Apparatus, that is if they are dismissed with respect as State Civil

sanctions regarding violations of the Neutrality of State Civil Apparatus there were Many cases related to the State 
Civil Apparatus are not neutral and take sides with certain interests in public services. 
 
5.  Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion can It was concluded that the Regional Government Policies in the 
Context of Realizing Public Service Motivation in the State Civil Apparatus were not optimal because they were still 
there is a neutrality violation by the State Civil Apparatus atlevel theof policy content and policy context. In the content 
dimension of the State Civil Service Neutrality Policy public services have not yet produced positive benefits for 
society. The bureaucratic climate has not shown the changes to be achieved in line with the democratic practices that 
take place in the local government, which should be independent, not involved in politics and can provide services to 
the community in a professional, honest, fair and equitable manner. It is time for public administration reform to 
prioritize service transparency between the public and the government. There are still obstacles that occur in the 
implementation of the Neutrality Policy for the State Civil Apparatus, for example officials who are authorized to 
have a hierarchical relationship with candidates who take part in services in the form of kinship, regionalism, ethnicity 
and the like, lack of strict sanctions given, rewards or benefits Human resources are wrong one obstacle during 
carrying out public service duties.

Abstract 
The history of the industrial revolution starts from industry 1.0 to 4.0, increasing digitalization of manufacturing 
supporting factors such as increased data, computing power and connectivity, analytics, business capabilities and 
intelligence, changing human-machine interactions, and improving digital changes to the physical world, such as 
robotics and 3D printing. This paper describes how the basic principle of industry 4.0 is the amalgamation of machines, 
workflows and systems by implementing an intelligent network along the production chain and process to control 
each other independently. The research findings show that transparency of information is the ability of information 
systems to create cyber knowledge by enriching digital models with data sensors including data analysis and 
information provision. There is an aid system to support humans by combining and taking information consciously to 
make informed decisions and solve proximity problems in a short time. 
 
Keywords:  
Government, Public Administration Reform, Digital Services 
 
1. Introduction 
Industry 4.0 is marked by an increase in manufacturing digitization driven by four factors: 1) Increased data volume, 
computing power and connectivity; 2) The emergence of business analysis, skills and intelligence; 3) The occurrence 
of new forms of interaction between humans and machines; and 4) Improved digital transfer instructions to the 
physical world, such as robotics and 3D printing. That also the basic principle of industry 4.0 is the combination of 
machines, workflows and systems by implementing an intelligent network along the chain and production processes 
to control each other independently (Lifter and Tschiener, 2013). Hermann, et al, (2016) added, there are four 
industrial 4.0 design principles. First, interconnection (connection), namely the ability of machines, devices, sensors 
and people to connect and communicate with each other through the Internet of Things (IoT) or the Internet of People 
(IoP). This principle requires collaboration, security and standards. Second, information transparency is the ability of 
information systems to create virtual copies of the physical world by enriching digital models with sensor data 
including data analysis and information provision. Third, technical assistance which includes: (a) The ability of the

literacy. Regions must be able to meet digital competencies. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The Regional Government currently has to prepare the competencies possessed by the State Civil Apparatus (ASN) 
from their competencies such as special skills, education levels, leadership skills, innovation, digital competence and 
high creativity. Leadership in local government must have a transformative leadership spirit, where the leader of a 
region is able to translate and change the current conditions to the current conditions Industrial era 4.0. The readiness 
of a region in supporting the Industrial 4.0 revolution includes organizational business readiness, technology 
infrastructure readiness and human resource readiness. Local government strategies in preparing for the Industrial 
revolution include encouraging workforce in Indonesia to continue to learn and improve skills to understand the use 
of IoT technology or integrate internet capabilities with industrial production lines, use of digital technology to spur 
productivity and competitiveness in small and medium industries.

Abstract 
Digital-based simultaneous regional head elections which aim to build autonomous regions. This is in 
accordance with the regional government administration system in Indonesia, namely the Regional 
Autonomy policy which explains that each Regional Government is implemented based on the principle of 
decentralization in the form of broad, real, and responsible autonomy. In the context of implementing such 
broad, real and responsible autonomy, the Regent and Deputy Regent have a very strategic role in the field 
of governance, development and community service and are fully responsible for the running of regional 
government. The essence of the aforementioned objectives, among others, is to emphasize more on the 
principles of democracy, community participation, equity and justice and to pay attention to regional 
potential and diversity. Thus it can be interpreted that regional autonomy is expected to prosper the people 
and revive democracy which is reflected in the program, performance and figure of a regional head who is 
currently directly elected.

1. Introduction  
In a democratic government system, the role and ability of the Regional Head in running the government is the most 
important element in addition to other elements. This ability also concerns the ability to make pro-community policies. 
This is in line with the fulfillment of sovereignty or power in the hands of the people. It is the people who are sovereign 
and at the same time the main owner of this supreme power within the framework of a democratic system. Rasyid 
(2008: 23) explains that the difference between democratic and undemocratic systems lies in the fact that in a 
democratic system, such authority and power are built and maintained based on the agreement of the people. Thus,

livelihoods. In detail, the livelihoods of the residents of Pulau Semambu Village can be described in the following 
table. 
The entire population of Pulau Semambu Village embraces Islam, while the level of community education varies from 
elementary to high school graduates and some have graduated from college. In 2013, Pulau Semambu Village has 
succeeded in building community capacity through community self-reliance. Under the coordination of the Head of 
Pulau Semambu Village, he was able to establish a TAHFIZ AL-Qur'an Islamic Boarding School which was managed 
independently in collaboration with Ustadz and Ustadzah from Al Ittifaqiah Indralaya Islamic Boarding School and 
under the guidance of Ustadz Zainal Abidin. The establishment of the Islamic Boarding School aims to increase 
devotion to the creator and improve moral education for the next generation, especially young people in Pulau 
Semambu Village. This is evident from the concern of the Semambu Island Village Government with the progress of 
Islamic religious education in Pulau Semambu Village as evidenced by the presence of TK TPA recitations in every 
mosque in each hamlet and continued with house recitation by the Koran reciting teacher. 
 
Pulau Semambu Village consists of five hamlets and ten RTs. In running the village administration, Pulau Semambu 
Village is led by the village head and assisted by village officials consisting of a village secretary who oversees the 
Head of Government Affairs (Kaur), general and development affairs. In addition there are also Heads of Services, 
Heads of Government and Heads of Welfare. As for the hamlet limah, it is headed by each hamlet head (Kadus) who 
oversees two RTs, and is supervised by the Village Consultative Body (BPD). Clearly, the structure of the Semambu 
Island Village government can be seen in chart 5.4 of the structure of the Semambu Island Village Government, 
Indralaya Utara District, Ogan Ilir Regency for the 2019-2025 Period. 
 
Candidates for Regent Ogan Ilir 2020-2025 Panca W.A. Mawardi SH, his last position was an entrepreneur and Head 
of Sports Law, KONI, South Sumatra Province. He is a youth figure who works not only in youth organizations as 
well as entrepreneurs in the Limbersa automotive sector. By advancing in the Pilkada Simultaneously, he hopes to be 
able to raise Ogan Ilir forward, both from development in each sub-district and prioritizing the welfare of all Ogan Ilir 
people. Panca WA. Mawardi SH promises to the people for the welfare of the people who get assistance such as loan 
funds for the construction of mosques in each area, the construction of school repairs visited by Romi Heton is true 
that this statement was immediately spoken by the community in the local sub-districts, Apart from this the community 
was promised by Panca WA . Mawardi SH will lead the city of Ogan Ilir to become a city that is disciplined, clean, 
making a city that is comfortable for the community and the socialization carried out by Panca WA. Mawardi made 
the public feel close to the candidate for Regent Ogan Ilir. Ilyas Panji Alam, SH, MM is known as the head of the 
incumbent area. Those who have faith in their victory are the victories of the People. These candidates for Regent and 
Deputy Regent are supported by the political party Golkar, PDIP, Hanura. Ilyas Panji Alam, SH, MM has a strong 
determination to advance the people of Ogan Ilir city with the community believing in leadership to become the Regent 
of Ogan Ilir. Then Ilyas Panji Alam, SH, MM Ilyas Panji Alam, SH, MM claimed to have received support from the 
community and the youth of Ogan Ilir. Ilyas Panji Alam, SH, MM is determined to succeed in bringing Ogan Ilir City 
to a more advanced and polite person and has no boundaries with the upper middle class, down-to-earth, and among 
teenagers because he often participates in funding outstanding student programs, entertainment programs among 
teenagers and helps finance infrastructure of the disaster faced by the people of Ogan Ilir city. 
 
5. Conclusion 
All candidates for the Head of Serentak 2020 have carried out campaigns by mastering social media coverage, 
especially in the Covid 19 Pandemic Era to increase their popularity and elasticity. They are trying to increase their 
capacity to become leaders in the current period, because it is not enough just to have work experience and social 
networks and political parties to attract the sympathy of the public, but on the other hand, the community considers 
that candidates for regional head are important to convey the vision and mission of the campaign virtually in the city. 
Ogan Ilir is a new choice for the people of Ogan Ilir City to become a competent leader, but the lack of experience in 
politics and government makes its popularity and capacity still doubted by the community. 
 
At the time of the Covid 19 pandemic at this time it was important for the Government to make a digital campaign 
system in the form of socialization, especially the election of the Regional Head in Ogan Ilir Regency in the future. 
This is in order to build the electability of each candidate in showing their seriousness in running for themselves in 
the regional elections in the current democratic era. Efforts to declare themselves to the public in a virtual way to 
become candidates for the elections made their electability through social media.

Abstract 
Background: The importance of science related to Big Data was a need in overcoming the performance 
problems of health professionals to overcome disease healing for clients in the hospital. The understanding 
mechanism of Big Data in nursing will certainly positively impact the client's recovery process during 
treatment in the hospital. Purpose: This study aims to find out how the Big Data mechanism can be applied 
in overcoming the performance of health workers in providing professional nursing care to clients. 
Methods:  This research uses quantitative methods to measure Big Data's health mechanisms' degree of 
understanding. To obtain the common research finding, researchers used cross-sectional analysis. 
Meanwhile, to get valid results during the study, the researcher uses observational analytics techniques 
Result: Healthcare professionals were expected to understand Big Data and knowledge mechanisms in 
addressing client care. This can be seen from the research results that explain that (n) p-value (≤ 0.05), 
which means that understanding Big Data was essential in knowing how efficiently caring the clients' 
health. Conclusion: Big data analysis is indispensable in health sciences at this time. Health data recorded 
in the database can help clients overcome health problems, especially those in the community. In addition, 
the work experience and ability of nurses to analyze Big Data medical records will undoubtedly have an 
impact on the rapid recovery of patients in hospitals.

care is a reaction or response shown by nurses to stimulus or objects in planning stages, health implementation.   
 
When viewed as health workers' professionalism based on their general experience, they have worked more than five 
years and can handle clients better. In addition to performing, they can also analyze work based on health cases that 
he has done as a skilled health worker at the hospital. Data shows that 25% of health workers have worked for more 
than five years, meaning that the health institution must provide additional knowledge in special skills training so that 
all health workers can work better.  According to Nasirin and Lionardo (2020b), performance is a function of 
motivation, opportunity, or work environment, while motivation is built by the personality. Therefore, performance is 
an overview of the program of the organization's strategic planning activities in improving the institution's quality. 
The performance of health workers in providing care is determined by nurses' knowledge and attitude in applying 
operational standards of procedures given to patients and families of patients. Based on the explanation above, the 
better the nurses' knowledge and positive attitude, the better nurses' performance in providing nursing care to patients. 
In line with this opinion, good performance greatly contributes to improving health care according to operational 
standards. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis of the performance in providing nursing services for health workers is based on the results of chi-square test 
and to get the result of study comparative by using SPSS program version 22 to explain the relationship among 
knowledge and performance of health workers with a value of p (0.015) with a significant value of 0.05. The study 
results show that health workers' better knowledge, the better performance of healthcare professionals in providing 
nursing care to the clients. Therefore, the more positive attitude of health professionals to the clients, the better their 
understanding of healthcare workers in delivering healthcare to patients.   
 
Based on the explanation above, there is a significant relationship between health knowledge and performance in 
providing health care emergency department with P-value chi-square value (0.015) < (0.05) Ha, respectively. Health 
workers' experience about health care being classified as acceptable and the most performance is positive. (Zhao et 
al., 2020) stated that the health services in its implementation are a nursing practice that is the independent action of 
professional nurses through collaboration with clients and other health workers in providing nursing care according 
to the environment of authority and responsibility. Nurses who are quick to respond in providing services will cause 
patient satisfaction with the perceived benefit. The rapid response is the nurses' promptness in providing services to 
patients either directly or only provide information quickly and precisely when the patient needs it. A good service is 
a service provided in a reliable, precise and accurate, friendly and understand patients' wishes. According to Pettersson 
et al. (2020), mention good service means hearing patient complaints, greeting patients, and other attentions limited 
to nurse-patient therapeutic relationships. From the explanation above, the nurse's more positive attitude and better 
nursing care can be given to patients. Therefore, nurses' positive attitude is very influential for nurses' nursing services 
because it can provide a comfortable and satisfying impression to the patient towards the waiter given a nurse.   
 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that the utilization of big data in health services in emergency departments in hospitals is essential. 
Some research findings can be the next discussion material for other researchers, such as implementing health workers' 
performance in providing health services can be an example for other health workers, especially in delivering health 
services in the community.

Abstract 
This research aims at analyzing the teaching of EFL vocabulary through anticipatory learning strategy. 
This research was conducted at one of the Islamic Colleges in Indonesia. The subjects were the students 
of the first semester 2020/2021 academic year. The design of the research was CAR (Classroom Action 
Research) which was done in two cycles with three meetings for each cycle, using two techniques as 
anticipatory learning strategy; organizing by words families and organizing by words classes (noun, verb 
and adjective). The data were collected through observation, questionnaires, and tests. The data were 
analyzed descriptively and quantitatively. The result of the research revealed that the application of ALS 
(anticipatory learning strategy) can develop the students’ vocabulary and can change students’ learning 
behavior and attitudes in terms of students’ active, enthusiasm, participation, and motivation. Moreover, 
students’ performance could be improved during the process of action by achieving the setting of passing 
level in cycle two. The result of quantitative data from cycle one is 52.92% become 87.49% in cycle two. 
Therefore, anticipatory learning strategy could help students to develop their vocabulary and improve 
their English proficiency.

1. Introduction 
Indonesian students study English as a foreign language. They get many problems to perform it as they learn it after 
they firstly acquired their national language. Students at Palu State Islamic College encounter a lot of difficulties 
related to the language components: for examples grammar, vocabulary and language skills: listening, speaking, 
reading and writing. Many English teachers/lecturers attempt to look for and to apply appropriate strategies that can 
overcome the problem so the students will be able to perform it in communication (Alqahtani, M., 2015; Tosun, 
2015; Cahyono & Widiati, 2015; Asyiah, 2017; Susanto, 2017; Marzuki, 2019; Al-Awaid, 2020; Namaziandost et 
al., 2020).     
 
Vocabulary is one of the language components to support the implementation of the four language skills. They are 
taught to the students integratedly (Carter & McCarthy, 2013; Alqahtani, M., 2015; Marzuki, 2016; Abdulrahman & 
Basalama, 2019; Chen, 2019; Kuliahana & Marzuki, 2020). Developing vocabulary mastery is considered as a first 
step done by them when performing the language in oral or written communication (Carter & McCarthy, 2013; Şen 
& Kuleli, 2015; Guaqueta & Castro-Garces, 2018). Particularly in writing and speaking skills, vocabulary is much 
needed in arranging phrases or sentences and making conversation. Surely, without vocabulary, it would be 
impossible to learn a language (Siyanova-Chanturia & Webb, 2016; Zou et al., 2019; Al-Awaid, 2020). 
 
Related to the present fact that most of the students in Islamic colleges especially for the first semester students were 
unable to write or speak English, because they are lack of vocabulary stock. They could not understand and know 
the meaning of the words they read. They could not write English as they did not have enough vocabulary and good

’English vocabulary mastery. So automatically the techniques were supporting by some argument related 
anticipatory learning strategy was explained previously. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Teaching and learning activities that employed of the techniques word families and word classes can raise the 
students’ enthusiasm, motivation, response, interest and progress in joining the class based on the result of 
qualitative data. The students’ vocabulary mastery can be developed through the employed anticipatory learning 
strategy in the following procedures: first in pre-activities the researchers activated the students’ prior knowledge 
through asking some questions related to the materials. Second in while-activities the researchers explored the topic 
by making diagrams of word families and word classes related the students’ problems of the words. They have given 
the first task to do in pairs or groups. In these activities the students made lists of unfamiliar word from a short 
passage according to their pairs or groups, the second task is the students did individually. In this section the 
students develop vocabulary by constructing a sentence based on the words discussed in the first task. Third in post-
activity the researcher gave evaluation related to the two techniques which were applied in teaching and learning 
process. The result of this research has shown that after comparing three meetings in cycle one which is 52.92% 
becomes 87.49% in cycle two. It means, the two techniques applied had been contributed positively in developing 
students’ English vocabulary mastery.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of hospital image and quality of service on Discharge Against 
Medical Advice (DAMA) via patient satisfaction at Majene District Hospital. This research was performed in the 
hospital room of the Majene District Hospital from July to August 2020. The type of analysis used is quantitative 
research to explain the dependent variable's effect on the independent variable and the mediating variable. This study 
population was all 102 patients with DAMA at Majene Hospital, as the population was deemed limited and the whole 
population was sampled. The test results of the coefficient of determination of the path analysis of substructure 1 
resulted in a modified R square value of 0.235. In this case, it is argued that patient satisfaction is affected by the 
hospital picture and quality of service by 23.5 percent. In comparison, the remaining 76.5 percent is influenced by 
other variables not analysed in this review. The outcome of the measurement of standardized beta coefficients, the 
effect of the hospital picture (X1) on patient satisfaction (Y1) is 0.228, and the service quality (X2) on patient 
satisfaction (Y1) is 0.325.

Abstract 
This analysis aims to define and evaluate the impact of motivation and rewards on management productivity through 
the Soppeng District Police Station (Polres) performance appraisal framework. This study was performed using a 
causal design and a quantitative methodology at the Polres of Soppeng Regency. Both Soppeng District Police 
officers, as many as 351 personnel, were in the sample community. The sampling procedure was carried out using a 
purposeful sampling technique in this analysis, and the final sample collected was 150. Data collection methods are 
carried out by evaluation, interviews, questionnaires and notes, and data processing techniques using route analysis. 
The findings revealed that the efficacy of management is the secret to an organization's progress in completing 
multiple roles and duties in line with predetermined objectives. Additionally, benefits are often a consideration that 
plays a significant role in impacting the success of management. A decent and equitable level of rewards encourages 
workers to fulfill their tasks optimally. It would further improve the organization's professionalism in performing 
performance analyses that are done due to high commitment from the apparatus and equal and proportional rewards 
offered to them.

Positive and significant with an impact value of 0.224. The Soppeng Police agency or unit has a sensitivity for its 
officers, where the incentives are one of the reasons that reinforce synergies between officials to cause their success. 
The incentives make the officers not jealous of each other to not concentrate on carrying out their duties. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on this report's results, it can be inferred that management efficacy is the secret to an organization's progress 
in being able to carry out its different roles and duties in compliance with its predetermined objectives. Via 
management quality, the priorities to be accomplished with proper preparation and programming would be obvious, 
making it very urgent for the department, especially the Soppeng District Police. However, to achieve management 
efficiency so that the aims or priorities previously set can be accomplished appropriately, there must be 
encouragement from the apparatus. Besides, benefits are also a component that plays a crucial role in shaping 
management effectiveness. A decent and proportionate level of rewards encourages workers to conduct their tasks in 
the best possible manner. As a result of the apparatus's high morale and the equal and proportional benefits offered 
to them, the organization's integrity in carrying out the success evaluations that are obtained can be further 
strengthened.

1. Introduction 
In fact, not a few policies have been taken by the government in efforts to reduce poverty. The government's efforts 
in overcoming poverty had been carried out long before the onset of the monetary crisis in mid-1997. This can be 
seen from the many anti-poverty programs, for example KIK, KMKP, P3KT, PKT and IDT.

will therefore be more motivated so that they become strong in their optimal motivation. 
 
Impact of the Empowerment Policy on Empowerment Efficiency by Collaboration of Empowerment Institutions at 
the Soppeng Regency Group Empowerment Service. The effect of the empowerment policy component on 
empowerment success through the coordination of empowerment institutions is positive. To increase the maximum 
outcomes is in an increase in the achievement of empowerment and different actors' involvement, including 
government departments. From the lower level to the top, it must produce high coordination such that, from the 
program preparation stage to the execution and assessment process, it can be compatible with what has been 
mentioned. And therefore, in compliance with the rules of the statute. 
 
The Effect of Empowerment Policies on Empowerment Success by Quality Assistants at Soppeng Regency's Group 
Empowerment Service. The empowerment policy variable's effect on empowerment success through the 
companion's content is positive and essential. Government initiatives aimed at strengthening national growth 
through community empowerment have supported societies and improved their potential to enable themselves to be 
more advanced and productive. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study's results can be inferred that empowerment policy seeks consistency in its execution. The active 
participation of the population in encouraging itself through empowerment, removing any imbalances in society, and 
assignment approaches through government-issued regulations contributes to the philosophy of sustainable growth. 
Empowerment policies that are well applied allow the group to be motivated, increase awareness, and improve its 
capability. The success of empowerment is accomplished by a high degree of public consciousness. Coordination of 
government agencies to create public awareness is a critical task. The instructor's consistency demonstrates that they 
are not only offering assistance regardless of the role given to them, but there is a challenge to how the group should 
be better motivated so that they can optimize themselves to accomplish what they desire. In comparison, a good-
quality partner is to see that people are happy and more prosperous in their lives. The effects of empowerment 
carried out by trained partners will make the group more able to explore their abilities and be more motivated to 
become powerful and drive themselves in the best possible way.

Abstract 
 
The optimization of Warehouse Layout and Order Picking are essential to warehouse management in companies 
trying to follow the trend of one-day shipping. This paper studies a Textile Industry with this objective, proposing a 
change in warehouse layout and applying a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the objective of optimizing the order 
picking operation. The proposed GA uses sales data and data mining to minimize the distance between the 
company`s bestselling items. The results have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, supplying two optimal 
warehouse layout configurations with minimal distances between the most sold items.

1. Introduction 
 
Warehouse operations are a critical part of logistics and its optimization can lead to lower costs and better 
productivity. Warehouse operations have a strong influence on both investment and direct operational costs (Chen et 
al. 2015, Pan et al. 2018). Same-day shipping is one of the objectives for business that are trying to follow a trend 
set by companies like Amazon (Giannikas et al. 2017). Considering the fast development of logistics, the use of 
conventional storage method is insufficient to meet the demands of production and transportation (Liu et al. 2014). 
The optimization of both inventory and storage allocation is an important issue for warehouse management (Gibson 
et al. 2016). Thus, it is known that to meet customers demands and apply a same-day shipping policy, the 
optimization of warehouse operations is paramount in a company. One of the warehouse operations that can be 
optimized is the Order Picking (OP) 
Order Picking is a critical warehouse operation. This activity handles the retrieving of items from their storage 
location to satisfy customers orders (Henn, 2012). This operation is repeated for each order and may be influenced 
by sectoral requirements, customer requests, order structures, transportation routes and warehouse layout (Yener, 
2019). OP usually involves at least four actions: pre-action, searching, picking, transport and other (Chen, 2014). OP 
is one of the most labor-intensive operations in a warehouse (Koster, 2007) and it is estimated that OP can be up to 
70% of the costs of a warehouse (Chen, 2014). Thus, the optimization of OP can reduce the operational costs and 
decrease the average time of shipping. One of the approaches to optimize OP is the utilization of a Genetic 
Algorithm (GA). 
Metaheuristics, mostly Genetic Algorithm (GA), has been used to solve optimization problems related to order 
picking and warehouse management. Ardjmand et al. (2019) applied a GA to optimize order picking in a put wall-
based picking system. Pan et al. (2018) uses GA and a simulation model to improve layout planning in a warehouse. 
Beroule et al. (2017) implemented a GA to improve routing and items allocation in a warehouse of a hospital 
pharmacy. Chen et al. (2014) developed a hybrid solution using GA and Ant Colonization Optimization to solve an 
integrated order batching, sequencing, and routing problem. As far as we know, there are no publications of GA 
applied to OP considering the limitations of a textile industry. 
The proposed study differs from the related works in three aspects: case scenario, problem modelling and solution 
method. On Ardjmand et al. (2019) and Beroule et al. (2017), the major challenger is related to the order batching

1","Figure 9. Warehouse layout for the Best Individual (Tournament Selection) 
 
There is an agglomeration of the top 6 colors on aisle 0 and aisle 1, where is possible to observe 5 data mining rules 
(#1, #2, #3, #4 and #12 from Table 2) on aisle 0 and one rule (#9) on aisle 1. Together, aisle 0 and 1, presents 5 rules 
(#7, #10, #17, #18, #28) and concentrate 60% of the company’s sold colors. 
Aisle 2 presents two new rules (#5 and #8) and combined with aisle 1 the rules (#11 and #27) are observed. Aisle 3 
and 4 does not present any new associations and it concentrates colors who sell less on the top 30. 
 
3. Conclusion 
 
This paper presented an implementation of GA to support changes in a warehouse layout and to provide a better 
order picking time using a real case scenario, with data extracted directly from the company’s database. Besides, it 
was possible to test and compare two selection methods used in the study. 
Both selection methods presented feasible solutions and it was possible to identify some differences between them. 
Considering the GA designed in this paper, the Tournament Selection method showed more stability between 
generations and was able to reach an optimal region earlier. The Fitness Proportionate Selection method had more 
variations through generations but was able to reach the best individual earlier than the Tournament Selection.

9","Besides configuring the layout by top selling colors, the use of association rules enabled the fitness function of the 
GA to put the items that are sold together in a minimal distance, which leads to a minimization of the order picking 
time. 
The results demonstrate that the GA was able to minimize the distance between the best-selling items, having 15 out 
of 30 association rules within one aisle of distance while concentrating 60% of the sales on aisle 0 and 1. By 
optimizing the warehouse layout using association rules and best-selling items, it is expected to reduce the order 
picking time if compared with the current method used.  
This study is being analyzed by the company’s management and it is expected to be implemented until the end of 
2021. The proposed GA will be used to evaluate warehouse layout changes following the sales data throughout the 
years.

Abstract 
 
Discrete-event process simulation historically began its now long and distinguished “career” in support of manufacturing 
operations, ranging from assembly lines to make-to-order operations.  From than auspicious beginning, it has expanded its 
usage to many other fields, such as warehousing, public transport (e.g., airports, bus terminals, railroads…), health care 
delivery (e.g., hospitals, clinics, urgent care centers, dental practices…), government functions (e.g., welfare 
administration, timing of traffic lights, courthouses…), and the service industry.  Service industry applications of simulation 
have included restaurants, retail stores, hotels, and drive-through oil change centers.  In this paper, we describe the 
important and productive role of simulation in improving the service performance metrics and resource allocation within 
an automotive service center.

1. Introduction 
The first commercial uses, and still among the most numerous uses, of discrete-event process simulation have been in the 
manufacturing sector of the economy.  There, simulation first and dramatically showed its abilities to identify bottlenecks, 
evaluate proposals for eliminating them, improve and level usage of scarce and/or expensive resources, and improve 
performance metrics such as total output, queue lengths, and time waiting in queues.  As a result of and spurred by these 
successes, simulation usage rapidly expanded into the warehousing sector, health care (particularly hospitals), government 
work, transportation networks, and service industries, as documented by Greasley (2005).  Cepera and Konrad (2019) 
applied simulation to governance of complex transportation systems and traffic jams in Germany.  Many examples of 
simulation analyses applied to service industries have been documented in the literature.  For example, Villarreal-Navarro 
et al. (2017) applied simulation analysis to reduce shoppers’ exasperation at empty shelves at a network of Mexican 
convenience stores.  Call centers are a frequent service-industry application of simulation, as recognized by Mathew and 
Nambier (2013).  Williams et al. (2005) applied simulation to improve operations and traffic flow at a drive-through oil-
change center. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:  The next section presents an overview of the services provided by 
and the operations of the repair garage.  Next, we describe the data required by the model and describe the collection of 
those data.  Next, we present the process of building, verifying, and validating the simulation model.  Subsequently, we 
describe the results provided by the model and our analysis of them, leading to recommendations provided to the garage 
managers and owners.  We conclude with a summary of the project and indications of likely future work. 
 
2. Overview of Repair Garage Services and Operations 
 
Servicing consumers’ vehicles is a huge market worldwide, with three types of participants:  Dealers who also sell vehicles, 
independent repair shops, and a miscellaneous category including, for example, filling stations and specialty shops, as 
described by Horowitz and Shilling (1989).  The automotive service center studied in this simulation work is of the second 
category; it was opened in 2017, and is located near the economic development district of Beijing, the capital of China.  
This garage enjoys, has earned, and very much wishes to maintain, an excellent reputation for repair services performed 
with integrity and quality (in sharp contrast to worldwide stereotypes of automotive repair shops).  The center operates five 
days a week (Monday through Friday), opening each day at 8am.  After 4pm, no new arrivals are accepted for service that 
day, but the mechanics and other service personnel stay on duty until almost all (exception noted below) vehicles arriving 
that day have received service.  Therefore, a customer (e.g., an employee in a nearby office building) can and routinely 
does drive his or her vehicle (drivable but in need of repairs and/or routine maintenance) to the garage, leave it there, and

Given these results, the simulation analysis team presented two highly promising choices to the garage management: 
1. Recruit one more mechanic, keeping other specifications unchanged. 
2. Recruit two more mechanics, keeping other specifications unchanged. 
Recommendation 1 was predicted to provide the following improvements: 
1. Mechanic utilization would decrease from 91% to 80% (often considered “the ideal percent busy time” in 
operations research). 
2. Time in system for all types of work would noticeably decrease:  routine TIS from 1.47 hours to 1.00 hours; easy 
repair from 2.34 to 1.26 hours; small accident from 3.50 to 2.23 hours. 
3. Average run time would decrease from 12.31 hours (work done about 8:20pm) to 10.42 hours (work done before 
6:30pm). 
Recommendation 2 was predicted to provide the following improvements: 
1. Mechanic utilization would decrease from 91% to 68% (somewhat lower than usually desired). 
2. Time in system for all types of work would significantly decrease:  routine TIS from 1.47 hours to 0.78 hours; 
easy repair from 2.34 to 1.05 hours; small accident from 3.50 to 1.98 hours. 
3. Average run time would decrease from 12.31 hours (work done about 8:20pm) to 9.81 hours (work done shortly 
before 6pm), representing nearly two fewer hours of work daily. 
The garage management decided to implement the first recommendation – its advantages were better utilization of the 
skilled mechanics and its lower cost, since one fewer new mechanic would be hired.  The mechanics (including the newly 
hired one) were moderately pleased at the prospect of finishing their daily work, on average, markedly sooner.  This 
recommendation has now been in effect several months, and the predictions of the analysis have been fulfilled.

30","2 assigns itself as medium level of maturity, what does not look like appropriate because low commitment with 
continuous improvement is contradictory with basis of LPS.  
 
The last group, formed by companies called number 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8, assign themselves a low level of maturity, and 
it looks like appropriate. These companies indicated a low level of knowledge and use of tools and methodologies of 
LPS. Company 1 (in a medium level) and company 7 (in a low level) indicate that LPS is a part of administration 
concerns and plans. Same evaluation is indicated about workers participation in LPS. Nevertheless, all other answers 
show that this evaluation probably reflects wishes and not a technical point of view. Companies 4, 6 and 8 indicated 
the lowest level of punctuation (zero) in most of the questions about these topics, concerning workers and 
administration.  It is important to show that some specific tools are applied in an isolated way, not as a part of a wide 
action to implement LPS. For instance, a company pointed excellent results with the use of FMEA and 6 Sigma and 
does not know or use all other tools and methodologies. Similar thing happens with company 6, with SMED. About 
production organization, the results are different among these companies. While companies 1, 2 and 8 say that takt 
time is always or frequently respected, other companies say that it happens seldom or never. Just company 7 says that 
one-piece flow is not respected. Production based on the customer’s requests happens always in companies 2, 4 and 
8, sometimes in companies 1 and 6 and rarely in the company 7. It was expected that companies 1 and 7, which do 
not have any quality certification, do not have a well implemented continuous improvement process. What is 
surprising is that companies with strong certifications, like ISO9001-2015 (ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE 
NORMAS TÉCNICAS, 2015) and IATF16949-2016 (INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE TASK FORCE, 2016), 
do not have an effective continuous improvement process. The only exception is the company 4. Results are shared 
with workers at all levels, but always in a low scale. Therefore, companies of this group have a poor application of 
LPS and the use of few tools and methodologies that are applied is probably caused by an external factor, like 
customers or ISO9001-2015 (ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE NORMAS TÉCNICAS, 2015) audits. VSM is not 
used by these companies. 
Table 4 shows the use of tools by each company.

3. Conclusion  
This paper aims to study the deployment of Lean Production System principles, methodologies and tools in companies 
from the plastic sector in the region of Sorocaba, Brazil. To attend this objective, a questionnaire was applied to a set 
of eight professionals.  
Regarding the adoption of LPS, the questionnaire has proved to be useful in collecting detailed information about LPS 
implementation and use in companies of different sizes and organization. 
Despite the questionnaire being a bit long, its questions allowed to detect some contradictions in the answers that 
could expose the difference between intentions and actions of managers and companies.  
The 
analysis 
of 
the 
results 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
initial  
hypothesis (LPS would be known by plastic companies and used in different levels by them) is not true. This finding 
is very surprising because LPS principles, tools and methodologies are widely disclosed in Brazil since 1990’s. This 
disclosing happened not only in technical and academic environment, but in popular media as well. Of course, the 
discussion in popular media is not deep enough to modify a company but should be enough to call out the attention of 
managers and owners of companies that something new was happening.

35","Here, is possible to detect an interesting contradiction: according to LPS philosophy, it is difficult to an organization 
survive without eliminating wastes, but, in the real world, some companies are surviving for more than 30 years 
without using LPS principles. Certainly, these companies would have better results if they used LPS but, anyway, they 
survive. To understand why and how these companies survive could be the subject of another research.  
Among companies that took part in the research, some of them indicated high use of LPS principles, tools and 
methodologies, but they rated their own level of knowledge in LPS as intermediate. It shows that these companies 
know that there is yet too much to do to achieve a reasonable level of LPS. 
Finally, this scenario drives the analysis to one more fundamental question. LPS implementation needs some 
investments in physical structure, managerial practices, human resources and training. This implementation can be 
done easier with the use of information technology, but it is not obligatory. The question is, if LPS that is based on a 
relatively low investment, is still poorly used by some small and medium sized companies in spite of too many 
information available, what should we expect about new technologies that ask high investments in physical equipment, 
software, hardware, people training and so on? Will this kind of company disappear or will it find a way to survive, 
like it has been doing without the LPS? 
Besides the contribution of this research, some limitations are identified, to be addressed as future research, such as a 
larger sample of professionals from the plastic sector should be used to make the conclusions more robust; and also, 
to generalize the findings of this research it would also be useful to research other sectors since this research is focused 
only on the plastic industry.

Abstract  
 
The Transportation Management System (TMS) has helped many organizations to stand out and consolidate 
themselves in the market through a review of their processes and better optimization in the dynamics and 
distribution of internal activities. TMS has been a resource increasingly used by companies that seek a competitive 
differential in the market, such as: cost reduction, increase customer service, response time, process reliability, less 
information lost across processes, requirements fulfillment, product traceability, faster and more efficient 
management of human resources and equipment. A complete assessment of TMS implementation should involve 
multiple criteria. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is worldwide multi-criteria analysis method. The purpose of this 
paper is analyzing the weaknesses in the logistics processes of a company in the educational field that has not yet 
adopted a computerized system for planning, scheduling and controlling the execution of transportation. The main 
contribution of this paper is to provide a proposal to obtaining an efficient management of the whole logistic process 
of transportation of confidential materials through TMS and identify their main logistics processes and qualify them 
to improve it with AHP application.

The objective of the research is to identify the best sustainability practices most used in companies in the oil and gas 
sector to reduce the environmental damages of their activities, in order to take them into account in Mexico. The 
research is documentary, in which the leading companies in the oil and gas sector were considered as subjects of study 
based on their environmental performance and the development of substantive activities. The results presented are the 
best sustainability practices and the environmental impacts derived from the central activities of the oil and gas sector, 
as well as the mechanisms for implementing best sustainable practices in the case of Mexico. There is evidence that 
companies in the sector invest in sustainability practices to improve their environmental performance, while 
continuing to obtain economic benefits, in the direction of low carbon economies, however, it is necessary to give 
greater impetus to renewable energy sources that have taken relevance in recent decades.

1. Introduction 
The oil and gas sector is considered vital and strategic for the development and economic growth of many countries, 
including Mexico. This sector plays a central role as a supplier of hydrocarbons around the world, which are 
considered the largest sources of primary energy in global consumption with a participation of 57% (BP, 2017), they 
also represent economic potential and military strategic value (Puyana, 2015). The value chain of the sector consists 
of the Upstream, Downstream and Midstream phases, being its main activities: exploration, production, industrial 
transformation and hydrocarbon logistics. 
 
Activities throughout the value chain of this sector have caused serious impacts on the physical and biological means 
of its areas of influence (Roa, 2011), leaving serious environmental liabilities and deteriorating the quality of the 
environmental services they provide, of which there is evidence throughout the world and in the history of this industry 
(Oilwatch, 2006). Globally, it is estimated that in the next 20 years, hydrocarbons will continue to contribute a 
significant share in global energy consumption (EIA, 2016), therefore, the sector would be carrying out activities 
around this projection, but facing fundamental challenges, on the one hand, the supply of these resources and, on the 
other, how to achieve it through ethical behavior in the economic, social and environmental dimensions (Saavedra & 
Jiménez, 2014). The incidence of companies in this sector in Mexico has taken on greater relevance today, mainly due 
to the implementation of the Energy Reform of 2013, which now allows private participation in the activities of the 
sector, which were previously exclusive to the Mexican state (SENER, 2013). In this research, the sustainability 
management carried out by leading companies in the sector is analyzed and compared, which have been considered 
based on their relevance and participation at the international level in terms of sustainability and, some of which 
develop activities in important natural areas protected from the planet, in addition to being dabbled in alternative 
energy sources, all in search of those sustainability practices with which they have managed to reduce the impacts on 
the means of areas of influence, as well as the mechanisms they use for their implementation. This paper is organized 
as follows; in the following section of the literature review is developed. Second, methodology is introduced. Third,  
sustainability management and best sustainability practices in the oil and gas sector are discussed. Fourth, mechanisms 
for implementation of sustainability best practices for the case of Mexico are presented. Finally, the theoretical and 
applied contribution of this research is provided.

 The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative 
 Methane Guiding Principles 
 The Global Methane Initiative 
 
e) Indicators and performance goals in sustainability 
The approach of indicators and goals to reduce the environmental impacts derived from the substantive activities of 
companies in the oil and gas sector, is a way for them to adopt sustainability practices. Some goals could be set or 
aligned based on international agreements and initiatives, such as those previously indicated, being the most followed 
by companies in the oil and gas sector, the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, the latter more specific 
to set goals for reducing GHG emissions and other pollutants, aimed at combating air pollution. 
 
a) Participation in the development of sustainability policies and guidelines 
A fundamental part to accelerate the implementation of sustainability practices in companies in the productive sectors 
is to have environmental policies and guidelines. Policies and guidelines are identified to promote sustainability in 
companies in the oil and gas sector, such as: 
 Emission management; which promotes the reduction of GHG emissions and pollutants 
 Energy management; focused on energy efficient use 
 Water and effluent management; focused on water use and effluent treatment 
 Integral waste management; focused on the generation, management and disposal of waste 
 Ecosystem and biodiversity management; focused on protecting and preserving habitats 
 
c) Training in best sustainability practices 
An essential part in the implementation of sustainability practices in companies is that their staff is properly trained 
around these issues, which in many cases turns out to be a fundamental factor for their success. In this regard, there 
are some oil companies, such as Petronas, Royal Dutch Shell, Lukoil and PetroChina, whose objective in terms of 
sustainability is to carry out actions that contemplate their contribution to the development of the global oil and gas 
sector. On the other hand, one of the benefits of establishing alliances or collaboration agreements with other 
companies or organizations in the sector is that through them you can share knowledge and stay updated on 
sustainability issues 
 
5. Conclusions 
At international level, various groups, organizations and companies in the oil and gas sector have undertaken actions 
and new trends focused on reducing environmental impacts. One of the main actions is to reorient the conventional 
consumption and production of primary energy sources, moving from an economy of high CO2 emissions and other 
greenhouse pollutants, to a low carbon economy, making companies in the sector more responsible and sustainable 
In recent years, international initiatives and agreements, such as the “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030”, the “Paris 
Agreement” and the “SDGs of the 2030 Agenda”, have encouraged companies in the oil and gas sector towards 
implementation of best sustainability practices throughout its value chain, in order to contribute to its goals, so they 
turn out to be ideal channels for adoption. These channels are promoted by leading international organizations that 
group important companies, associations and governments in favor of the environment. Leading companies in the oil 
and gas sector, concerned and committed to environmental protection, including BP, ExxonMobil, Shell, Lukoil, 
PetroChina, Petrobras and Petronas, have designed and implemented best sustainability practices in the development 
of their substantive activities. 
In the case of Mexico, best sustainability practices are carried out in the oil and gas sector, although not all of the most 
representative of the sector, mostly through PEMEX, a state company that was in charge of the activities of the sector, 
exclusively, for more than 80 years, however, due to the opening of the sector to private companies, special attention 
will have to be given to new participants, since they represent an imminent risk of causing environmental impacts, so 
they will have to implement best sustainable practices and comply with environmental legislation at the national and 
international levels.

Abstract 
 
Many organizations use business processes as a tool to realize and sustain competitive advantage in the market. A 
business process is a structured collection of activities with comprehensible sequence and dependency to yield a 
required outcome. The optimization of these processes is of paramount importance because optimized processes yield 
adaptability, accurate information, enhanced efficiency, accountability through performance monitoring, and 
improved quality. Relying on business people such as executives and management to identify areas of improvement 
in the business processes is potentially subjective. This research commences on the assumption that business processes 
are fully constituted for a business and on this premise seeks an alternate, none subjective, optimization technique. A 
Decision Tree (DT) is a tool that supports decision making by means of a tree-structured modeling approach to map 
possible outcomes of a chain of interconnected choices. When applied in statistical regression modeling, a DT model 
employs supervised learning techniques to model decisions in a tree structure with possible results, input costs, and 
usefulness. In a DT model, aspects of an element are monitored and the model is trained to predict the future. DT can 
be applied to improve business processes by identifying activities or elements with significant impact when enhanced. 
This paper demonstrates business process optimization via DT regression modeling by the use of Python 
programming.

1. Introduction 
 
Organizations strive to achieve and maintain competitive market advantage by establishing business processes.  These 
processes need to be revisited, assessed, and optimized periodically. Therefore, the process models employed need to 
be of high quality in order to enhance the administration of business processes (Jiménez-Ramírez et al. 2015). 
Traditional business process optimization procedures include modeling current processes, identifying gaps in the 
current processes, and creating and modeling optimized processes. The manual enhancement and modeling of business 
processes become challenging when input is uncertain, events are correlated, and resources are to be allocated. 
Moreover, the manual procedure for enhancing business processes is subject to individual experience, preferences, 
and discretions which might be inadequate, unsuitable, or inefficient for the business (Parody et al. 2016). 
 
Defining, managing, and optimizing business processes is critical for the business to achieve and maintain competitive 
advantage. This research commences by studying existing literature pertinent to business processes and the 
significance of optimizing these processes. 
  
Decision Trees (DT’s) can be used for both classification and regression; however, this paper demonstrates DT 
regression techniques to predict future outcome (Gokgoz and Subasi 2015).  
 
The study continues by investigating Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques suitable for optimizing business processes. 
DT is one of the Data Mining (DM) tools for categorizing and predicting class variables. DT is known for its ability 
to utilize historical and current data to predict future outcome (Yan et al. 2016). DT is devised by recursive partitioning 
of data into multiple splits and fitting the prediction model with each split (De Oña et al. 2014). The splits are 
represented graphically as a decision tree. The DT regression method is selected due to its ability to examine the past

48","Other possible reasons for low productivity could be the rising trend of machine breakdown toward the end of the year 
(September and October). Breakdowns are usually caused by the absence of predictive maintenance plans, amongst 
other things. This problem could be avoided or lessened by enhancing the company’s maintenance plan and 
consequently implement predictive maintenance techniques, automate alerts for equipment breakdown, arrange 
resident technicians to respond promptly to breakdowns, and , perform route cause analysis (RCA) when attending to 
breakdowns.  
 
Possible reasons for low productivity in the month of December could be due to an increased number of holidays or 
the majority of workers (i.e., staff and shop floor) takes annual leave from the middle of December. Therefore, the 
company can take measures to increase productivity from the 1st to the 11th month in order to compensate for low 
production output experienced during the 12th month. 
 
The reversed engineering of a DT regression model allows businesses to specify the desired target and be presented 
with the most efficient ways to achieve the target. Specifically, the results of the reversed model shows that the same 
OEE value can be achieved by different values of availability, performance, and quality. This means that an 
organization might not always need to achieve 100% of availability, performance and quality. Instead, the model can 
recommend appropriate combinations that will yield a targeted OEE value. Because quality of semi-finished and 
finished products is pivotal, an organization can opt to keep the quality values constantly high but adjust the values 
for availability and performance accordingly. 
 
The authors of this paper recommend for the reverse-engineered model to be applied to all types of business processes, 
in addition to OEE. This would allow businesses to be proactive and choose the best possible and efficient ways to 
execute business processes. This is different from providing historical data and ask the model to predict the future. 
Instead, the business specifies the future and the model provides multiple options to get into the future. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
This paper emphasizes the importance of business process optimization. The right techniques and tools are pivotal to 
achieve optimized business processes. DT regression model has proven to be efficient in using historical and present 
data to predict future outcome and provide best possible ways to execute business processes. It is also possible for 
business to specify the desired future outcome and ask the model to identify aspects of the process to be adjusted 
accordingly.

Abstract 
 
Businesses define and manage Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s). The most effective KPI’s for business 
optimization is the subject of various studies. Various best practice bodies dedicate significant effort in defining smart 
KPI’s. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is able to digitalize the business so as to automate and collect data, 
facilitating digital constructs of defined KPI’s. 4IR introduces Big Data (BD), Big Data Analytics (BDA) and 
Advanced Data Analytics (ADA) for analyzing data collected from digital business integration. ADA engine generates 
relationships between data never conceived historically. The ability of business to apply the theoretical correlations 
for business optimization is a contemporary challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) spawns mechanisms that enable 
machines to be intelligent enough to react like humans. However, there is a misalignment between KPI’s defined by 
organizations and those discovered by analytics. This research proposes an approach to synergizing and developing 
smart KPI’s by bringing together 4IR and traditional approaches.

1. Introduction 
 
Business strategies are underpinned by planned objectives. The management and enhancement of these objectives is 
achieved through the implementation of Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) which specify, in detail, how to follow 
business goals (Propa and Goswami 2015). Crucially, vision and strategy should be defined more at a tangible level 
than at high level. This directs organizations in terms of making correct daily decisions. Proper and clearly defined 
vision helps an organization establish meaningful and constructive KPI’s (Pérez-Fortes et al. 2016). Once identified 
by an organization, the vision and strategy should be interpreted, captured, and visualized into expressive KPI’s for 
each organizational level, including the shop floor. Visual displaying of KPI’s promotes regular performance dialog 
and day-to-day cross functional assessment between processes, maintenance, and engineering. Furthermore, 
displaying KPI’s facilitates the escalation of some topics to weekly or monthly management meetings (Li et al. 2018).  
 
Businesses; globally, small, medium and large define and manage KPI’s. The most effective KPI’s for business 
optimization is the subject of various studies. Several best practice bodies dedicate significant effort in defining smart 
KPI’s (Jonsson and Rudberg 2017). The subjectivity and limitations of the KPI’s to quantify business effectiveness 
remains a challenge. 
 
 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies include the ability to digitalize the business to automate and 
collect data in order to facilitate digital constructs of defined KPI’s. 4IR introduces Big Data (BD), Big Data Analytics 
(BDA) and Advanced Data Analytics (ADA), facilitating greater analysis of all data collected from digital business 
integration (Sackey and Bester 2016, Santos et al. 2017). The ADA engine generates relationships between data never 
envisaged in the past (Sackey and Bester 2016). The ability of business to apply the theoretical correlations for 
business enhancement is a modern challenge. 
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), an area of the Computer Science discipline, produces mechanisms that enable machines 
to be intelligent enough to react like humans. AI comprises various technologies including Machine Learning (ML)

58","5. Conclusion and Future Research 
 
This paper emphasizes the importance of clearly defining business strategy, converting strategy into goals and 
objectives, managing and monitoring the company performance (i.e., goals and objectives) by implementing KPI’s. 
Moreover, the definitions and implementation of different AI and ADA statistical techniques are deliberated in detail. 
Consequently, the knowledge discovered creates the hypotheses that traditional, subjective KPI’s could be 
supplemented by the application of AI and digital technologies that in turn utilize ADA statistical techniques 
significantly. Synergizing traditional with 4IR centric KPI’s could reveal hidden patterns and relationships never 
conceived before in the organization. 
 
This research can be expanded into a case study where traditional, structured dataset is identified, copied to a different 
repository, and dismantled into unstructured data. AI and ADA statistical techniques could be applied on unstructured 
dataset in order to create optimized KPI’s and prove the theory presented in this paper.

Abstract  
 
The logistics sector of automotive companies often has operational deficiencies with impact to develop strategic and 
competitive advantages for the organization. The logistic sector has evolved over time and has been strengthened from 
globalization and technological development. This sector has been looking for improvements due to the importance 
of the operation for the production process and to raise the standard of operational efficiency. The research was limited 
to an automotive company operating in southeastern of Brazil, on Taubaté city, in order to identify potential problems 
and propose improvement on company strategy. The purpose of this paper is mapping of all activities of the logistics 
process in an automotive industry. The methodological procedure was the single case study as a viable methodology 
for logistic management. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a proposal model for new strategies to 
improve logistics management and to achieve operational excellence.

Abstract 
 
We present a tool to support beer production planning for Kunstmann company using system dynamics. A description 
of the production system was made, which served as base for the construction of the proposed model, through Vensim 
software. Storage for fermentation and conditioning in Unit-Tanks (UTs), filtering and temporary storage in Drunk-
Tanks (DTs), packing and product inventory were studied. The proposed model includes 3 level variables (UT, DT 
and Inventory) and 5 connected flows, taking into account the delays in the fermentation and maturation of beer, and 
the capacities of filtering, packaging and inventory. The process eventually stops when a desired inventory is reached. 
The structure described corresponds to the generic structure of a UT. By taking advantage of modeling with Vensim´s 
subscripts, together with a disposition in a spreadsheet of few parameters, this structure was simplified to generate up 
to 12 UTs in parallel. This tool allows those who carry out the planning work to test different scenarios and, 
particularly, to detect bottlenecks present in the DTs, in an agile, faster, and graphic way. With this tool, the production 
planner could evaluate theoretical production scenarios changing the main parameters that define the entire process, 
improving company's decision making.

1. Introduction  
Brewing requires planning to meet the time requirements involved in the process. Likewise, the installed capacities 
and the demand for the product must be taken into consideration. On the other hand, expertise about the complete 
process of who evaluates the production plans (and boiling in particular) is fundamental for the achievement of timely 
production. At Cervecería Kunstman, production planning is carried out using the experience of the production 
managers, making use of the data that have been accumulated over time. This way of carrying out the planning 
schedule has shown weaknesses, since the entire system operation may not be considered and, eventually, 
inefficiencies or non-fulfillment of orders could be incurred if the product is not prepared in a timely manner. In the 
framework of a project in which we were studying the production structure of industrialized and artisanal breweries 
in the city of Valdivia, Chile, this problem was mentioned by the manager of the plant, which motivated us to think 
about the matter and propose ways of deal with it. The idea then was to propose a model that would involve the main 
variables that make up the entire process.  
 
Cervecería Kunstmann can be classified as an industrialized brewery but still maintaining the peculiarities of a craft 
brewery. Since 2002, Compañía Cerveceras Unidas (CCU) acquired 50% of the company, which has allowed 
Cervecería Kunstmann to increase its production and reach new markets thanks to CCU distribution channels. It 
produces 16 different varieties of beer under its brand, the main one being Torobayo beer (around 75% of production). 
For this reason, it was decided to study its production, inventory and sales process and its impact on planning.  
 
Production planning involves several elements: sales forecast, production forecast, orders, warehouse, inventory of 
supplies, the availability of beer currently in the UTs (Unit-storage-Tanks) used to mature beer, and in the DTs (Drunk-
storage-Tanks) used to place the beer ready for bottling), as well as the finished product inventory. From the state of 
these variables, the production scheduling is carried out. Specifically, the idea is to project the inventories of the 
brewery for the following months. The result of the programming is informed to all those involved so that they are 
aware of what must be produced in the following weeks and their compliance percentage is verified daily in the sales,

70","5.3 Validation 
This model was validated by three methods: structural verification, dimensional consistency, and extreme conditions 
(Sterman 2000). In the first two tests, tools integrated in the Vensim software were used: Check Model indicating that 
there are no errors in the construction of the model and Unit Check which point out that there are no errors in the units 
of the variables considered. When we apply extreme conditions, the results shown in Table 7 were obtained. 
Ultimately, and perhaps more importantly, we should mention all the discussion we had with Cervecería Kunstmann 
staff and, particularly, with the manager of the company. They gave us important and relevant feedback about the 
variables and the model structure here proposed.

As was mentioned above, both models without and with subscripts work identically. The results are the same for both 
models.   
 
6. Conclusion 
The tool presented in this work combines elements of modeling and simulation of the main variables involved in the 
Torobayo beer production process in conjunction with the changing data of the parameters used for decision making. 
The visualization of the main variables behavior that arises from the structure of the proposed model allows 
contextualizing the production planning discussion with the management and other departments of the company. 
Consequently, it considerably improves the understanding of the entire process and the communication between those 
involved. It is an appropriate tool, we believe, to provide skills to those who make planning decisions, by using 
simulations. In addition, its development is relatively fast, as it connects elements of System Dynamics with 
spreadsheets that are mostly used in the company. The first model is a simulator, while the second one, with the 
subscripts, is a graphics viewer of a proposed production schedule through an Excel spreadsheet, but considering the 
interrelation between variables, delays, etc., generating graphs easily understanding by staff. The tool proposed was 
validated, in part, by Cervecería Kunstmann staff, as well as via structural verification, dimensional consistency, and 
extreme conditions. Both models are equivalent and generate identical results. Therefore, the main product we present 
here is a tool, which is in its early stages but, we believe, can help planner to understand the complexity and think 
about planning process considering the relevant variables and parameters acting together, as well as to visualize the 
dynamics generated among them. This tool could be used for training purposes, for those who start working in the 
world of beer production, too.

Abstract  
 
The measurement of the performance of supply chain management in the food industry is mainly focused on the 
analysis of environmental, social and economic aspects. However, reducing all the dimensions of the sustainable 
supply chain to a few units of analysis is a task that represents great difficulty in the field of administrative sciences.  
 
In this regard, the central objective of the analytical development presented below is to identify the different 
dimensions present in the measurement of the performance of the management of the sustainable supply chain in the 
food industry through the literature review in the field.  
 
As part of the results, four central axes of the analysis were identified: use of raw materials, waste, the measurement 
of environmental impact and risk management. Each of the identified dimensions is characterized by presenting 
multiple methodologies and approaches for measuring performance and contributing to the greater and better 
understanding of the field.

1. Introduction 
Currently, there is a trend towards greater responsibility for social and environmental activities. Consequently, 
companies do not only analyze their financial results, but the need arises to include social and environmental 
perspectives through sustainable performance.  
In addition, the trend in the food industry sector is to recognize sustainability as a central point in the development of 
operations, due to the high impact on the quality of life of its consumers. 
Therefore, there is a growing need to apply sustainable performance measurements that facilitate data collection, 
analysis and management and facilitate strategic decision making. 
However, despite applying some ways to measure the results of sustainability in organizations, the relevance of 
analyzing sustainable performance is low in business management. Therefore, the main purpose of this document is 
to identify the different dimensions present in measuring the performance of sustainable supply chain management in 
the food industry. 
To this end, a content analysis is carried out in scientific publications in the field of sustainability, which allow 
identifying the different study dimensions related to the measurement of sustainable performance, focused on the food 
industry. This to facilitate a synthesis of the different analysis approaches that contribute to the theoretical and practical 
development of this topic.

Abstract  
 
The management of the sustainable supply chain presents a set of challenges regarding the productive 
process and the strategic approach adopted for its development. Challenges that is associated with 
different motivators that make sustainability a key element in making strategic decisions and direct the 
competitive approach of organizations. To explore the different motivators in strategic decision making of 
organizations in the field of sustainability, the article is aimed at identifying and analyzing the different 
motivators that organizations have to address the management of sustainability in their supply chain 
sustainable.  
 
To this end, a documentary review of the production of scientific articles is developed to identify the 
different motivators, their origin and their treatment at a strategic level. As a result of the analysis, four 
major motivators for the organizations were identified: environmental regulations (policies, policies, 
laws); market demands (products and consumers); efficient use of productive resources; and, the culture 
of organizations.

Abstract  
The paper presented below is intended to identify and analyze the main characteristics of voluntary standards of 
sustainability (VSS) in the international market of agro-industrial goods based on the review of scientific articles 
published in recent decades. To this end, a bibliometric exercise was methodologically proposed that allowed the 
collection and processing of a scientific corpus of 61 articles that respond to the objective of the analysis. 
As a result of the processing of the information collected, the findings were classified into five analytical 
dimensions. The first, oriented to the theoretical foundation, describes the main theoretical perspectives that support 
the practical development of VSS. The literature review raises the responsibility of producers and consumers to 
advance in a consensus on new approaches that accelerate actions and solutions to the challenges of sustainable 
development, incorporating the need to establish partnerships for the implementation of sustainable development 
globally. 
The second dimension, focused on the development of VSS in international food trade, highlights the increasing 
complexity and impact of global supply chains, the integration of new management and marketing methods that 
respond assertively to reducing these impacts. Environmental and the assurance of the global food chain as the 
central axes of the VSS. 
The third dimension, in which VSS are associated with the production of biomass and forest products, analyzes the 
importance of the creation of private organizations for the establishment of norms and standards oriented to 
“sustainable forest management”, thereby creating incentives for compliance with regulations that contribute to 
ecological sustainability, social justice and the safety and efficacy of agro industrial products. 
In the fourth dimension, in which the main limitations identified in the VSS are proposed, the commercial tensions 
generated between producers and consumers are described given the increasing number of private standards for 
international trade, which pursue similar objectives that generate a “market of standards ”saturated. In addition, the 
literature highlights the restrictions of VSS given its voluntary nature, the limitations of the demand for such 
products and the challenge of including small farmers, where private standards can only partially compensate for 
structural weaknesses in governance in the field of natural resources. 
Finally, in the fifth analytical dimension, the relationship between VSS and fair trade in the international market of 
agro-industrial goods is proposed. The literature describes the VSS as practices for the development of equitable 
commercial relations that guarantee the sustainability of the supply, especially of agro food products in local and 
international markets.

Abstract  
 
The formulation and development of sustainability reports represent an effort by companies to manage social and 
environmental impacts of increasingly global supply chains. Indeed, economic globalization has increased the risk 
of moving productive activity to countries with much less stringent labor and environmental laws and regulations. In 
view of this, the importance of establishing sustainable supply chains in the world market of agroindustry products 
is highlighted, especially supported in the establishment of reports that include indicators aimed at assessing the 
social and environmental impact in each of the links in the chain. 
For this reason, the preparation of sustainability reports significantly influences the development of sustainable 
practices within agribusiness companies and their supply chains, as they allow them to better respond to consumer 
expectations for accessing products that have less impact on the society and the environment. 
In this sense, the main objective is to identify the main factors that influence the formulation of sustainability reports 
and their implications to guarantee the sustainable supply chains of agribusiness companies by analyzing content 
based on scientific articles selected through equations of search developed according to the review of literature in 
the field. 
The predominant findings highlight the growing trend in the use and application of sustainability reports as a form 
of global trade assurance, especially in agroindustry products. Likewise, the limitations of its implementation are 
raised, which come mainly from its voluntary nature that does not have an agglutinating nature, the low levels of 
standardization in the preparation of the reports and its high implementation costs.

Abstract 
 
Research on change management and its impact on organizational performance has become a significant 
factor for the preservation of organizations that operates in markets with high level of uncertainty.  
However, change management cannot be considered as an attribute of the organizations by themselves; it 
is closely related to the management and leadership skills of the chancellor, principal or school directors. 
Being the high schools, those organizations that must be at the forefront of the training processes; this 
research aims to establish the perception of the schools’ directors regarding the creation of an environment 
conducive to organizational change. To do this, a research instrument was applied to 338 schools throughout 
the country, extracted from a ranking of the best high schools in Colombia, according to the results of the 
state tests that are performed on their graduates. The main results indicate the use of proactive language, 
transmit positive energy and demonstration of gratitude are the most frequent skills to lead positive change 
in Schools. Likewise, assertive communication becomes a skill to improve and develop change processes 
in those educational institutions.

1. Introduction 
 
Any type of organization requires management to be exercised in a professional manner in order to achieve its business 
objectives. Companies dedicated to construction, engineering, medicine, or design, require knowlegable managers to 
run the business. By knowlegable managers, the authors mean leaders who have both, hard (technical skills) and soft 
skills (interpersonal skills). It has become crucial for organizations to high perform; in this regard, companies in the 
education sector must also do so. 
 
School directors, in addition to the training for teaching and the intrinsic knowledge they have about their profession, 
they must have such knowledge that allows them to manage the institution and understand people with whom they 
work. In doing so, they should achieve maximum commitment toward institutional activities and decisions 
(Gorrochotegui et al., 2014).

114",,"From the experience of this study, later work can be developed in two different research lines: the first one, constrating 
these results with those obtained from the staff, co-workers or team members. The second one, looking for the 
application of the instrument in executives of other sectors. It allows to compare the perception of development of 
these competences according to the sector in which the manager perform. 
 
On the other hand, this study can also be developed in Colombian schools that are not classified as part of the best, 
with which managerial styles can be compared. From the results, several training programas can be created that 
contribute to the improvement of management skills, along with it the improvement of basic and secondary education 
in the country. 
6. Limitations 
 
This study encountered the difficulty to reach the schools directors, who in the first instance did not agree to the 
solution of the questionnaire for reasons of distrust of those who communicated to conduct the survey. Once this 
aspect was resolved, some executives saw the research as an intrusion in their managerial work, with the aim of 
evaluation. As a result, a clearer and deeper explanation of the intended scope was necessary, since the initial objective 
was getting the students closer to managerial experiences, which are near to their future professional work. 
 
As it is a survey that seeks to evaluate the development of managerial competencies from the same answers given by 
the population under study, there may be biases since the self-assessment may differ from the assessment of those 
who depend directly on the direct one that gave the response to the Questionnaire. In this sense, it is convenient to 
carry out the research work, apply the instrument to a different population (employer or workers who are subordinate 
to the manager), in order to establish the coincidence or difference in the results.

Abstract 
The objective of this research work is to describe the escalation of commitment, also known as a commitment bias, a 
phenomenon that is evidenced in the actors who make decisions in organizations, the government, among others. In 
order to make the behavior of escalation of commitment in the organization visible and to have the possibility of 
analyzing it in real situations, we designed and implemented an academic case on the actions that can take place in an 
organization, identifying the most relevant components of the literature that are part of this behavior. Initially, a group 
of 464 people, with knowledge in administration and finance, were asked about the way in which they visualize the 
escalation of commitment in the proposed case and the most relevant attitudes associated to it; then, we analyzed 
which of the components are the ones that most influence the decision making of financial managers; and finally, what 
actions would be the best to implement with this behavior. The results of this work show that commitment escalation 
behaviors, as well as organizational behaviors, are more relevant and important for the group of older women than 
any other group of the population.

1. Introduction 
When decisions are pushed to the limit, crisis is the most likely scenario, just as in the case of Chernobyl (Ross & 
Staw, 1993). Based on this, the relationship between the risk that is perceived and the level of responsibility generates 
four types of conditions: 1) the staggering of commitment: characterized by high responsibility along with a low 
perceived probability of loss, resulting from overconfidence by the decision maker (Ross & Staw, 1993); 2) the 
erroneous abandonment: characterized by high risk and low responsibility; 3) the escalating indecision: there is little 
fear of loss and little fear of accountability; and 4) the economically reasonable decision: characterized by high risk 
combined with high responsibility. This is how decision makers are living the real world (Drummond, 2014) (Figure 
1).

As it can be seen in figure 9, the action “Getting different people to make the initial and subsequent decisions of a 
project” with a rating of 3.5 is the least valued in the two groups, that is, it is the action that least decreases the 
escalation of commitment. Like the other actions, the “elderly” rate the actions more than the younger ones (Figure 
9).

5. Conclusions 
Staw (2005, 1981, 1976) asserts that his appreciation of the escalation of commitment is an approach to the reality 
that is experienced within companies, and invites further investigation into the phenomenon through the understanding 
that “the dynamics of escalation can be a truly multilevel process that requires much more interdisciplinary thinking 
... and that can be developed as a multilevel theorization in the field of organizational behavior” (Staw, 2005, p. 232). 
Similarly, it invites researchers to develop research ideas by observing the participation and decisions that actors make 
in the environment (Staw, 2005). He explains that the aim of the theory is to answer the question of “why” and it is 
strengthened and deepened by taking into account the connections of the phenomena. ""It is a story of the explanation 
of why certain events are acted out and take place, where the convincing and interconnected logic of arguments is the 
support of the theory, since a good theory explains and predicts"" (Staw, 2005, p. 235). 
In order to make a field study of the escalation in an organization, there are three key aspects must be taken into 
account in the presentation of an escalation: 1) an ongoing decision, 2) negative or ambiguous feedback, and 3) 
opportunity to commit additional resources over the time (Staw, 2005) 
In the case of the escalation of commitment and its application, different applications at the business level have been 
found, such as the case of the investigation on the decisions of local and international investors carried out by Devigne, 
Manigart, and Wright (2016). This study investigates the differences between local and foreign investors when 
investing in venture capital. The research focuses on determining the influence of emotional, social, and institutional 
factors on an unsuccessful investment, the sample was 1,060 investors in 684 European technology companies. 
The results show that national investors have a high tendency to intensify their commitment, while investors outside 
their border have a lower social and emotional involvement in the project and a lower entrenchment in the local 
economic and social environment. In addition, investors tend to avoid the completion of failed projects; they increase 
their commitment and continue to invest, even though the information shows that the investment does not meet the 
expectations. 
This is surprising, as venture capital firms protect themselves against this kind of decision bias. First, investment and 
termination decisions typically require approval by one or more investment committees, rather than by an individual.

144","This is consistent with the theory of self-justification, which suggests psychological pressures as an explanation of the 
increase in commitment (Sleesman et al., 2012). 
Another element to consider is if the investment is made jointly with another company with which policies or 
regulations regarding withdrawal from a project are agreed. Non-compliance can also lead to a bad image and to limit 
access to new investment projects. 
The investigation by Devigne et al. (2016) revealed how the emotional, social, and institutional differences of 
international investment, compared to investment in the country, can protect venture capital investors from the 
escalation of commitment when an investment tends to fail. 
In addition, he discovered how the differences in the emotional attachment and social integration of each of the 
investors, domestic and foreign, are different in this type of venture capital investment. It becomes apparent that there 
is a greater likelihood to escalation of commitment for national venture capital investors in relation to international 
investors, either by investing through a local branch or its headquarters. 
The behaviors of the escalation of commitment are valued differently if the decisión makers are ""younger"" or ""older"", 
or if they are male or female. For “older” women over the age of 33, the component where the greatest value is given 
is the organizational component; while for a ""younger"" man, its component is psychological. 
The most valued or important aspect of the organizational component is ""Worker support policies"" as this reflects the 
link and responsibility that is created between the organizational part and its workers. With regard to the psychological 
component, the most valued element is in particular what refers to self-esteem: ""not wanting to assume self-esteem 
conflicts”. 
Among the less sensitive elements for escalation among the groups that were analyzed, we found: management actions 
to avoid escalation, the difference between simulated and reality, and other demographic data such as city, marital 
status, and number of children. 
It is important to highlight that there is a great influence of the theory of escalation of commitment in the decision 
making of companies, and therefore, it would be interesting to apply its concepts to a specific sector in Colombia, and 
to a specific decision in order to have an empirical test of the application of this phenomenon and consequently reach 
conclusions or new contributions. 
6. Limitants 
In the development of the investigation, we identified the following as main limitations: (i) the impossibility of 
determining the partiality or impartiality of the interviewee, since elements of the individual management of the 
persons in charge of a company may be revealed in the questionnaire, (ii) the time that was required to read and 
interpret the proposed case, and (iii) the little demographic information obtained from the interviewees. Overcoming 
these limitations may lead to finding relationships between the levels of escalation of the commitment. Among the 
main limitations, it is necessary to highlight the impartiality of the interviewee, the time available to read and 
understand the case and, in particular, to have more demographic study data, such as level of education, social stratum, 
or years of experience in business management.

Abstract 
 
This work presents a proposal of teaching statistics with adapted use of the game Poker. It is considered 
the most popular card game in the world and it is usually played in casinos and nightclubs. Because of its 
popularity, the International Federation of Match Poker (IFMP) has achieved recognition of the game as a 
sport of the mind, as well as chess and checkers. Meanwhile, Statistics deals with the collection, analysis, 
interpretation and presentation of numerical data in large volume from a relatively small sample. Due to 
its importance, Statistics is required all engineering courses, and specifically for industrial engineering, it 
is the basis for areas of manufacturing systems, operational research, logistics and quality. The purpose of 
this article is to demonstrate the applicability of the Texas Hold'em poker game adapted for teaching 
probability to students of all engineering backgrounds, thus improving the teaching method of the 
discipline. A small adaptation of the rules of the game to develop logical reasoning and probability 
calculation quickly develops in students the ability to apply probability in the game. The application of 
Poker encourages learning through competition by improving students' engagement in the study of 
probability calculation. The results of the application demonstrate greater assimilation of content and 
problem solving by the students.

Abstract  
 
The aim of this paper is to develop a framework for AI in construction management, to achieve this, a sequential 
literature review as the research methodology shall be used. Key words such as AI construction projects, labour 
productivity, project key success factors, construction project’s job security and AI project risk management is used 
to search for published journal articles form Google Scholar and Scopus. The findings based on sequential literature 
review revealed that various AI technologies exists, and each has a different purpose and application. The research 
findings reveal application of each AI technology on each project life cycle phase. A theoretical framework based on 
the research findings is developed which illustrates the application of AI technologies across the project lifecycle and 
the results of each application. AI can be used in planning, design, simulation of construction projects, it can also be 
used in advanced project execution phases of construction as well as in sourcing of materials and modularisation of 
high-end and specialised construction material and modules. There is a threat of job losses in adopting AI, it is a reality 
and not a myth, however, AI can create plenty more jobs in the new technological value chain.

Abstract  
 
The energy problems of countries and global warming is one of the most necessary difficulties to be solved 
by society. In this research, microbial fuel cells (MFCs), a new way of generating voltage using as fuel the 
bacteria Actinomycetes, Bacillus sp and Escherichia coli.  The bacterium Bacillus sp showed higher voltage 
generation with a peak of 0.65 volts, during the five days of data collection; the pH and conductivity 
parameters of this bacterium were 7 and 24 mS/cm respectively. Due to the voltage generated from this 
bacterium the pH was adjusted to 4, 7 and 10 to observe the influence that this parameter has on the voltage 
produced during twelve days. The pH 7 was the one that showed the highest voltage during the whole 
sampling. The pH of these cells remained constant as well as their conductivity which was 41.7, 24 and 
52.6 mS / cm for the cell of pH 4, 7 and 10 respectively; the data were taken at room temperature (⁓21°C).

1. Introduction 
Energy demand worldwide is increasing, and even more so in rural areas. Therefore, in order to meet these 
needs, the use of both non-renewable and renewable energy sources, which are environmentally friendly, has 
become a necessity. On the other hand, the problem of climate change is being driven by the release of 
greenhouse gases such as CO2, in the use of some types of energy. Due to this problem, it is not possible to 
continue generating this type of electricity in this way, that is where the environmental challenge facing 
humanity comes in. For this, there are renewable energies (wind, solar, biomass), all of them can meet our 
future energy needs, but are not used in our country. While a microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a 
bioelectrochemical system that generates electrical energy from the interaction of microorganisms in 
different aqueous media dissolved by oxidation of organic matter (biomass). An MFC comprises a cathode, 
an anode and almost always a cationic or protonic exchange membrane accompanied by an electrical circuit; 
the fuels can be glucose, acetate, lactose among other components that can be used, as long as they have a 
biodegradability factor that can be used by different microorganisms. This type of technology is currently 
used in energy production and wastewater treatment.

4. Conclusions 
 
In this research, low-cost, agar-based microbial fuel cell type biobattery prototypes were created. The bacteria used as 
substrates (fuel) were the Actinomicetros, Bacillus sp and Escherichia coli. The Bacillus sp was the one that showed 
greater voltage in 5 days with a maximum peak of 0.73 volts. The pH and conductivity values for this bacterium were 
6.5 and 24 mS/cm respectively. In the constructed MFCs the pH of the bacterium Bacillus sp was varied because this 
was the one that showed the highest voltage in the first 5 days. The MFC with pH 7 showed the highest voltage 
generation in 12 days, which reached a peak of 0.65 volts on the first day. pH and conductivity (24.01 mS/cm) 
remained constant throughout this period.

Abstract  
 
The criteria and requirements for the elaboration of the Sustainable Logistics Management Plan (PLS) have been 
incorporated into three dimensions of educational process - research, teaching and extension - of Cefet/RJ, as a 
planning tool for new actions, within its objectives and responsibilities. actions, goals, deadlines and monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms, thus contributing to the establishment of sustainability practices and expenses rationalization. 
The objective of this project is to monitor sustainable initiatives adopted by Cefet/RJ, a Brazilian Higher Education 
Institution (HEI), which are aligned with PLS axes: consumption of natural resources (water), waste management and 
sustainable procurement based on a qualitative, applied, descriptive and documentary research. In addition to 
understanding how this HEI has been seeking to meet its sustainable goals. It is from the realization of current practices 
and follow-up, it can be concluded that Cefet/RJ follows the path towards sustainability, thus representing the desired 
new institutional culture model and can be analyzed as an example to other universities.

Abstract 
This paper presents an analysis of the events involved with the fall of the Boeing 373 Max aircraft, trying to answer questions 
related to the reason for the aircraft malfunction. 
Keywords 
Case Study; Malfunction; Boeing; 373 Max. 
1. Introduction
The Boeing 737 MAX plane crashed on march 10th of 2019, the disaster was preceded by another 
accident involving the same model as the American multinational company on October 29, 2018. These 
events raise questions about the safety and reliability of the model, where it was possible to observe several 
factors coinciding in both cases. Through exploratory research we try to analyze the facts involved in the 
tragedies and understand the chain of events that preceded the accidents. 
In 2019 G1 news showed that in the first case, during a flight operated by the company Lion Air 
from Indonesia, in October, the autopilot system was questioned, pointed out by checking the aircraft's 
black box, showing that the automatic system the flight repeatedly put the aircraft in a diving position [with the 
tip down] due to a malfunction in the sensors. 
Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said the company knows the chain of events that caused both 
disasters, in which a wrong activation of the anti-stall system (avoiding loss of aerodynamic lift) [MCAS] is 
a common link between cases. (G1, 2019) 
2. The Boeing 737 and The Maneuvering Characteristics Enhancement System (MCAS)
According to analysis by Travis (2019), 737’ first appeared in 1967. It was very well accepted by 
airlines compamies for its simplicity, reliability and flexibility. Not to mention the fact that it could be flown by 
a crew of two. Over the years, the market and technological forces have pushed the 737’ to increasingly larger 
versions,

3805",,"application. This problem was mitigated by the lack of technical specifications and user training, which, 
as presented, it was limited to fifty-six minutes of flight simulation. 
The facts presented demonstrate a lack of interest by the company in providing excellence in its 
products, due to the increased monetary and time costs involved in the production and training processes that 
the changes would accept it. 
In news, G1 (2019) points out that Boeing engineers had identified a flaw in the alert software for 
pilots of the 737 MAX plane as early as 2017, several months before the Lion Air crash.  
In 2017, in a review report, Boeing said: “The absence of a warning about AOA sensor discrepancies 
had no negative impact on the safety or operation of the aircraft, concluding that the existing functionality 
was acceptable until the relationship between the alert and the indicator could be undone in the next planned 
update of the system software. display”. Despite the claim to update the software, the changes were not made 
until the events involving the company's two aircrafts.

Introduction
The internet is currently the main agent that makes possible the communication from people to people, 
machine to machine and machine to people on a large network, this interaction is called Physical Cyber System 
(FRAÇA, GIOCONDO, p. 35). The term Industry 4.0 emerged on a plan developed by Germany to promote high 
technology, it is also known as Advanced Manufacturing, IOT (internet of things) and Intelligent Industry. 
(CAVALCANTE; ALMEIDA, 2017) 
According to Rodrigues et al. (2018, p. 13), the industry 4.0 is understood as the integration between the 
digitalization and the industry, sensors and equipment connected through the network, merging the virtual and 
the real world. 
This digital transformation is being responsible for the 4th Industrial Revolution and it has three pillars, 
that when integrated, constitute a foundation within industries, they are: Automation Systems, Information 
Systems and Physical Cyber Systems (RODRIGUES et al., 2018, p 13) 
This research carried out is exploratory document referential methodologies, such as: articles, scientific 
magazines of various nationalities, in order to comprehend the theme’s international state.

will act as a facilitator in the Industry 4.0 for the future most efficient industrial ecosystems.  
Currently, concentrated efforts are needed to combine the proposed capabilities of Industry 4.0 and emerging 
technologies. With this combination, Industry 4.0 will be able to make use of the power of the current and 
emerging technologies to dramatically improve complex ecosystems adopting new technologies.

Distribution Management 
 
 
Abstract: 
Lean six sigma and logistics associated with business-to-business transactions have changed the way the 
warehouse and distribution systems operate. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing 
countries face problems in coordinating the lean application and distribution logistics due to lack of 
resources and improper directions. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to enhance the 
effective use of warehouse systems and develop a matrix to improve productivity. The coordination 
matrix includes the structural relationship among different factors of lean improvement and logistics 
tools, which is responsive to distribution logistics strategic decision making. A total of 20 enablers for 
lean and logistics for coordination of distribution management have been identified based on the best 
practices and literature reviews. These factors are grouped into five categories, such as waste control, 
flow management, quality assurance, warehouse operations smoothness, and continuous improvement. 
The paper has explored the major factors for coordination of the lean and logistics simultaneously to 
gain potential benefits in distribution management. It will be of great value for SMEs in developing their 
strategies for coordination in distribution planning.
