Abstract 
Building maintenance is an important building need that a building requires to serve its design purpose. Most 
buildings are decaying because of lack of maintenance. Building owners fail to prevent buildings from decaying 
because of lack of maintenance strategies knowledge. This paper look at the appropriate maintenance strategy 
between preventive and predictive maintenance for south African house. This is achieved through determining 
building components that require preventive and predictive maintenance strategy in order for the building to 
perform its function without any harm. Conclusions were made based on the importance of the building 
components on the building.

Introduction. 
Building maintenance is an important program for the sustainability of infrastructural development. It plays an 
important role among other activities in building operations (Zulkarnain et al. 2011). There are several definitions 
of maintenance in the previous literature. According to Ali et al. (2013), describe maintenance as the technical as 
well as managerial processes that guarantee that every component of the building is in a suitable state to carry out 
the intended function.  
As to BS 3811(1984), maintenance encompasses all technical and related measures taken to either preserve an 
object or return it to a state where it can fulfil its intended purpose. According to Chanter and Swallow (2006), 
maintenance is a collection of actions done to either conserve or restore an item to a usable state. Maintenance 
can also be defined as an ongoing process that keeps a facility in optimal condition and safe for daily usage (Mydin 
2015). According to BSI (1964), maintenance is defined as work done to bring the facility that is, each component 
of the site or building back to a satisfactory level. 
Work performed with the purpose to protect, reclaim, or enhance each component of a building, including its ser
vices and surroundings, to  presently suitable quality and maintain the economic and aesthetic value of the buildi
ng"" is how (Seeley 1976). About medication, maintenance to building can be associated with medication that the 
body requires to heal the illness. Out of the different explanations mentioned above by different researchers, all

Stage 3: The data gathered from previous literatures and then analyzed. This stage sum-up the paper by presenting 
the conclusion of the study as well as presenting the recommendations for the study. This article is based on a 
literature reviews whose goal is to firstly to determine building components that require preventive and predictive 
maintenance strategy and to determine an appropriate maintenance strategy between preventive and predictive for 
buildings in South Africa.  
 
Conclusions. 
The primary objectives of predictive and preventive maintenance are to minimise the cost of response to failures 
and improve asset reliability. Both types of maintenance are considered scheduled maintenance since orders for 
repairs are prepared well ahead of the actual date of maintenance. Preventive maintenance is conducted on a 
regular basis whereas predictive maintenance is scheduled according to equipment conditions. Predictive 
maintenance entail monitoring the state and productivity of tools utilizing advanced technology and data analysis. 
Its objective is to anticipate possible faults and enable proactive maintenance procedures, as a result of mitigating 
unexpected downtime. 
 
Conversely, preventive maintenance entails planned inspection cleaning, and repairs which aims to stop faults 
prior to happening. It develops maintenance schedules based on past performance and manufacturer guidelines to 
ensure consistent service and handle observed hazards. 
 
Findings. 
Both preventive and predictive maintenance play an important role on the components of the building, more 
specially because the most building comprise of preventive and predictive elements which requires maintenance 
of different strategy. Preventive strategy is mostly important because it has components that predictive strategy is 
not applicable to such as foundations, paint, roof, tiling etc. Secondly preventive maintenance is significant 
because it can also be applicable to other building components that requires predictive strategy. 
 
Recommendation. 
The primary objective of this study was to determine an appropriate maintenance strategy between preventive and 
predictive for buildings in South Africa. This included determining building components that require preventive 
and predictive maintenance strategies. Based on the literature both strategies play different roles on the building 
both having an essential impact on the operation of the building. It is therefore advisable that both strategies be 
considered as follows. 
• 
Preventive maintenance should be applied to components that require inspections and monitoring such 
as foundations, roof, wall, paint, tiles doors, windows, doo frames etc. 
• 
While predictive maintenance should be applied to components that makes use of advance technology 
and analyse data from many systems and parts of the structure

Abstract 
Quality management and quality engineering have been known as a game-changer for improving processes and 
practices in organizations, moving struggling ones out of trouble, and giving performing ones an edge over their 
competitors. To stay relevant, quality management and quality engineering education need to keep abreast and 
embrace emerging technological developments in industry. As academics, it is our responsibility to ensure that the 
student is skilled to work confidently when faced with a variety of technologies in this industrial revolution.  Two 
universities of technology in South Africa offering advanced programs in quality management and quality engineering 
seek to integrate appropriate technologies into the quality management and quality engineering curriculum. Gibb’s 
Reflective Cycle was used to position our thinking on suitably aligning course content to appropriate technologies. 
After reflecting on the course content, technologies, and course delivery, certain modules were identified where a clear 
match was made between appropriate technology and subject content. It is envisaged that this would be a stepping 
stone to bring quality management and quality engineering into the technology-driven space in the near future.

Abstract 
The vast majority of South Africans depend on public government-funded healthcare. Public healthcare services in 
South Africa face many challenges related to amongst others, waiting time, inadequate resources and funding 
constraints. Furthermore, the availability of the correct pharmaceutical stock at primary healthcare clinics is often 
problematic with excessive amounts of stock reaching its expiry date at these clinics.  This research focuses on four 
primary healthcare clinics in the Potchefstroom area in South Africa that are supplied with pharmaceuticals by the 
Tlokwe sub-district distribution pharmacy. We find that pharmaceutical supplies at these clinics are often out-of-stock 
or expired due to a multitude of factors including the absence of a data management system. In order to solve this 
problem, we present a data management system for pharmaceutical stock at a primary healthcare clinic that does not 
require extensive software or hardware layout and is also easy to use for healthcare practitioners. The solution is 
designed based on industrial engineering principles that critically analyze the system requirements to ensure that the 
solution is suitable for the unique primary healthcare clinic environment. Our research further elaborates on the 
additional factors that influence pharmaceutical stock mismanagement at primary healthcare clinics. Finally, we 
provide results on a pilot run of the implementation of our solution which paves the way for further implementation 
at other primary healthcare clinics.
