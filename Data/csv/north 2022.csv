Abstract 
 
Nowadays agile methodologies have been developed, and are used in organizations because companies face highly 
competitive and globalized markets with constant changes (Arias, 2020). The paper is going to be based on “Lean 
Manufacturing” which is a system that aims to eliminate waste from the process through continuous and systematic 
improvement, without generating waste or defective products. The case of the study is based on solving the problem 
of low productivity for a textile company in Peru, which had been caused by the excessive waiting times between 
operations and manual activities with a higher percentage of defective products, for example, 7% in the clothing area. 
In this paper first, we recollected the actual information like batches, the floor plan, production costs, etc. within we 
simulated the as-is and after that the as-if. This article uses the “Lean Manufacturing” methodology and with it, the 
losses of products in manual processes will be minimized, going from 10% of safety stock to 6% per order. This goal 
is going to achieve optimizing transfer times between areas and eliminate those activities that do not generate value 
for the company, using tools such as “5S”, “Value Stream Mapping”, “Acceptance Control Charts”, “Just In Time”, 
“Process Reengineering” and “Simulation”. Through simulation with the Arena software, the results were validated, 
achieving an improvement in the reduction of times by 5.8% and increased productivity by 4.1% thanks to tools such 
as VSM, line balance, and control charts. The importance of this study is the findings can be replicated in other papers 
from the textile industry.

1. Introduction 
The study has focused on a medium-sized textile company. This company presents problems according to its 
percentage of defectives, which requires manufacturing an extra 10% of the order units as safety stock; and waiting 
times for transfers between areas and garment manufacturing time.  
Currently, the textile company has dedicated to exporting its garments to the United States of America. Likewise, the 
average number of orders manufactured by the company lies in batches of 2736 units of jeans. 
In addition, throughout the study, the objectives will be defined, performance will be measured, results will be 
analyzed, the process will be improved, and the operations of the textile company will reduce time, achieving increased 
productivity.  
 
The application of Lean Manufacturing's tools such as ""5s"" and ""Just in time"" will reduce the timing, increase 
efficiency and effectiveness, and reduce the variability of the processes, identifying the causes that generate low 
productivity and achieving the desired improvement.

25","operation was previously carried out in 1.5 minutes, while the machine would have a value of 2.7 punctures per minute. 
Likewise, in the clothing area, the total time was reduced to 22,818 minutes in the area. 
Finally, the hypotheses and objectives set were met, since the implementation of ""Lean Manufacturing"" and its tools, 
productivity increased by 4.1% reducing execution times, which shows that this variable is inversely proportional to 
the total time production, in addition to reducing the margin of the safety stock, from 10% to 6% versus the margin of 
safety stock outlined in the objectives of this article, which were 7%. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, by implementing “Lean Manufacturing” tools (control chart, line balance, VSM, and simulation) it was 
possible to increase productivity by 4.1% to the total manufacturing time. 
 
It was shown that there is an inversely proportional relationship between the application of the “Lean Manufacturing” 
tools and the total time since, when implementing these tools, the time is reduced by 5.9%. 
 
Also, it was possible to reduce the extra margin produced by defectives from an initial 10% to a final 5% due to the 
application of the VSM; however, a 6% slack will be considered to cover the margin of human error. 
 
The increase in productivity with the time variable could be evidenced by simulation with the Arena software, taking 
an initial simulation sample of 144 units, an improvement of 19.78% of the total time was obtained, and a 51.28% 
improvement in the finishing area.

Detection System of Acoustic Signals

Abstract  
 
Detecting acoustic signals can help with daily life to a large extent. Depending on a set frequency, one can detect 
lifesaving emergencies such as intruders or leaks (Levine 1999). On top of this, once detection has been made, many 
different outputs can be created as a result of that detection. Once an intruder comes, the system can automatically 
contact authorities or if a leak is detected, the system can automatically notify the user that the leak has occurred. 
Detecting acoustic signals provides us with the comfort of being able to live more stress-free knowing that there is a 
system in place ready to detect an emergency at any time. The main question of our research was to come up with a 
system that detects acoustic signals and outputs a Peak frequency after performing a high pass filtering (Novick et 
al. 1999) of the frequency of detected sounds. In this work, we implemented a sound detection system that is 
fundamental to the functionality of devices such as alarm systems and medical devices. The implemented system is 
successful in detecting sounds. In addition, we tested the system using a Simulink testing and verification system 
which is the first verification system to be taught in undergraduate engineering programs. It involves a sound-based 
verification, in which, when the test passes, a particular sound of 400-490 Hz will ring. Loyola University Chicago 
is now the first university to have successfully completed DVT Design Verification in an Undergraduate 
Engineering program using Simulink. This testing and verification system has also proved to be useful in industries 
and companies as Simulink testing is becoming more commonly used because of its powerful model-based design 
and testing features. 
 
Keywords  
Sound, detection, LabVIEW, MyDAQ and Simulink. 
 
1. Introduction  
This system is designed in LabVIEW to detect any acoustic signal and process the signal through a high pass filter. 
After this, a peak frequency is outputted. This system is important because it can be used in many applications 
including but not limited to biomedical, cyber/ computer, environmental applications. We list some examples of the 
system’s uses. The system could be used: 
• 
as a fire alarm system after detecting sounds of fires. 
• 
as a security system for the protection of homes, companies, industries belongings. 
• 
to detect water leaks or hydraulic applications. 
• 
to analyze acoustic signals and differentiates between sounds which could also open fields for interesting 
research projects that involves sound recognition. 
The realistic constraints of the system include having a LabVIEW license, Ni-MyDAQ, and a sound sensor 
(KY038). 
 
2. Methods  
2.1 LabVIEW Sound Detection and MyDAQ 
The security alarm system described requires only three components: the LabVIEW algorithm, the NI myDAQ, and 
the sound sensor KY038. Integration of hardware and software can be tedious without proper visualization of each 
subsystem, which is why LabVIEW serves as a visual programming language in which the user can customize and 
adjust hardware configurations as needed. The National Instruments myDAQ, a data acquisition device designed to 
be used with LabVIEW, can acquire digital and analog input signals from external sources or generate its own digital

6. Conclusion  
The simplicity of the design allows for a portable and low-risk system that can be used almost anywhere. The system 
could be used to detect intruders in someone’s home, water leaks from pipes in a building, or the functionality of any 
appliances that are supposed to make noise or that are not supposed to make noise (Cook and Ali 2012). 
 
Overall, the system is functional and extremely versatile. This sound detection system could improve functionality of 
devices as well as security of businesses and human lives (Sullivan et al. 1990.)

Design Projects, and will prove to be useful in industry as Simulink testing is becoming more commonly used. There 
is growing interest by companies in industry to utilize Simulink for its powerful model-based design and testing 
features (Masud and Whitman 2010). Additionally, students implemented the testing system while working in teams. 
This is important as teamwork is critical in having a successful outcome. Students successfully completed verification 
of the system and learned about Simulink verification testing.

Abstract 
Today, due to the expansion of the supply chain network and the development of the level and variety of orders and 
demand of product owners as active customers at the network level, there is a greater need to implement methods to 
streamline the response to these customer needs and their orders. In this regard, services related to the logistics industry 
as a very sensitive industry related to the life of various industries, requires rapid response methods, aggregation and 
centralization of distributed services in the logistics industry. With the development of artificial intelligence and IOT 
knowledge, it will be possible to provide virtual and artificial communication networks between different levels and 
layers of the supply chain network through the exchange of information in an agile manner and an artificial supply 
network consisting of provided logistics and trading services. The purpose of creating a knowledge-based product: 
Iran Logistics Market is to provide an intelligent platform for providing logistics-Trading services in order to create 
an intelligent value chain through the exchange of information and establishing agile communication between all parts 
of the supply-warehousing-distribution network. Facilitate the flow of logistics at the supply chain level and reduce 
the time-cost of answering and providing logistics-Trading services.

shortages or equation (15)?). An experimental investigation is underway to establish the same. In the next part of the 
paper we give how to handle shortages in the LDR (Linear Decision Rule) model of APP. The concept of aggregate 
shortage also; and give two ways to handle the same in the context of LP approach to APP. On similar lines we give 
a procedure that enables introduction of aggregate shortages in the LDR model of APP also. This is a useful

Abstract 
 
Consider the standard multi-item, multi-period, capacitated lot sizing problem with setup, inventory and backorders 
(MIMPCLSPWSIB). To this problem we add the issue of setup carry over. This is explained as follows. If an item i 
is scheduled last in period (t-1), and is scheduled first in period ‘t’, we do not incur setup time and setup cost in period 
‘t’. We incur setup cost and setup time only in period ‘t-1’. This results in problem MIMPCLSPWSCIB. We give here 
two formulations of problem MIMPCLSPWSCIB. We discuss the merits of each formulation in this paper.

Abstract 
 
Companies spend a lot of time and money training their employees, and when they leave, it hurts. When employees 
leave the company, it's important to know why they're leaving. An organization can't apply the same analytical method 
for each and every one of its employees, regardless of the industry or kind of business. We created two groups called 
cost leaders and differentiators to categorize firms based on strategy, structure, and uncertainty. In order to decrease 
employee turnover, cost leaders utilize 'predictive/prescriptive analytics, whereas differentiation leaders use 
'descriptive/diagnostic' analytics to do so. It is critical for HR Analytics to pay attention to the organization's strategy 
and structure. 
 
Keywords 
Organizational Strategy, HR Analytics, Employee Turnover.  
 
1. Introduction  
Official decisions have been more promising and precise as a result of the application of human resource analytics. 
For example, an essential approach for assessing staff retention rates for employee turnover is human resource 
analytics (HR analytics). It provides information to the organization about why employees leave and stay. For 
example, underperformance, rewards, a lack of competence, or something else may be at fault. Human resource 
analytics may also be beneficial in identifying areas where employees are having difficulty meeting their goals and 
objectives (Angrave et al., 2016, Olubusayo, 2020, Van Den Heuvel & Bondarouk, 2017).

Abstract 
 
Here we give standard 0-1 mixed integer linear program of CLSPSPIB. In this formulation we eliminate shortage 
variables and setup (0-1 integer) variables to pose the problem as ‘all real’ linear program in inventory and production 
variables. Based on its solution, we keep select variables as zeros or ones in the original CLSPSPIB. We get very good 
solutions in much reduced CPU time. Detailed computational experience is given.

several advantages. This line was further towed by Parvathy (2018) who suggested a novel heuristic for getting good 
solutions to single item capacitated lot sizing problem. Md Amir (2020) showed (empirically) that the new formulation 
due to Sharma and Sinha (2018) has merit.  
 
We give a novel heuristic approach to CLSPWSIPB that requires solving a LP. The solution of LP is used to selectively 
set 0-1 setup variables at zero or one. This leads to good solutions to original CLSPWSIPB at much less computational 
burden. Lot sizing problem with backorder, inventory, setup and production cost is posed as problem P below.

Abstract 
 
Here we consider a single vehicle routing problem (of unlimited capacity) that visits different dealers. As it visits the 
first dealer, it offloads the demand of first dealer and moves on to second dealer ‘lighter’. In this context we seek to 
minimize weight-distance of the entire tour. We give two formulations of the above. It results in a ‘cubic’ and 
‘quadratic’ terms in the objective function with negative cost coefficients in one formulation and positive cost 
coefficients (of ‘cubic’ and ‘quadratic’ terms) in other formulation. We give a novel linearization scheme for the 
resulting two formulations. It will be interesting to see computational performance of the two formulations given in 
this paper.  
 
Keywords 
Vehicle, Routing Problem, Cubic Terms, Objective Function, Quadratic Terms.

Abstract 
 
Particleboard (PB) is an essential engineered product, which is often used as a replacement for wood, thus playing a 
significant role to reduce deforestation and improving environmental sustainability. Proper selection of PB is 
important to make sure that the chosen product has the required durability and sustainability and thus can maintain 
the quality of the construction work. This study proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach, to 
evaluate the selection criteria of PB to aid the decision-makers of the civil construction projects. In this approach, 
the existing evaluation criteria have been categorized into four criteria- Physical Properties, Mechanical Properties, 
Chemical Properties, Health, and Environmental Impact. Then a Best Worst Method (BWM) has been used to 
determine the criteria and sub-criteria weights to evaluate the PBs. After that, a Weighted Product Model (WPM) has 
been applied to generate the final ranking of the products to aid the decision-makers to select the right product. The 
study finds Emission Level, Moisture Content, and Toxicity as the most weighted evaluation criteria to select a PB. 
For this study, the required expert feedback has been collected from the supervisors and managers of different 
construction firms in Bangladesh. The obtained results are expected to benefit the managers, supervisors, and other 
decision-makers of the construction projects to select the right product for their construction projects to maintain their 
quality and reputation. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
PB is mainly manufactured from chips (wood, jute stick, or other waste fibers) with adhesives bonding and 
pressing at a high temperature (Owodunni et al., 2020). Utilizing various waste fiber for PB manufacturing 
is the primary benefit of this product, which reduce the demand for natural wood for construction work, 
furniture, door, and other home appliances. Besides this, PB is more economical than natural wooden 
products (Bayram, 2020). For these, the world market share of PB is increasing every year. In 2020, the 
global market of PB was US$ 16830 million, which is expected to be US$ 21410 million by the end of 2027 
(360 Research Reports, 2021).

Abstract  
 
This study proposed a utility-driven two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model to understand how 
the patient preferences impact the additive manufacturing (AM) supply chain design decisions. The goal of the 
mathematical model is to maximize the utilities derived from the customer preferences by appropriately allocating the 
AM facilities in the targeted region under customer decision and demand uncertainty. The mathematical model is 
visualized and validated by developing a real-life case study that utilizes the biomedical implants data for Mississippi. 
Several sensitivity analyses are conducted to understand how the patients' behavioral decisions (e.g., price-centric 
versus time- or quality-centric customers) to purchase biomedical implants impact the AM supply chain design 
decisions. Experimental results reveal that AM supply chain is sensitive to the utility of the patients. For instance, it 
is observed that in addition to opening a facility in Lamar County, an additional AM facility is opened in Washington 
County to serve the rural patients in our test region Mississippi. The results revealed vital managerial insights that 
healthcare service providers and interested stakeholders could utilize to provide quality healthcare services by 
managing patient-centric AM facility siting decisions.

Abstract 
 
Social media platforms can be a source of recommendations for various items or products. Digital Marketing takes 
advantage of this potential, especially when using influencers to evaluate their items or products on social media 
platforms. Each influencer can be a recommender of items or products. Thus, one can question why this does not occur 
similarly in the area of science. This work presents a study in which shares/mentions were collected on a social media 
platform, Twitter, about scientific documents (for example, journal or conference papers, thesis, reports, and patents). 
We pretend to obtain the polarity of these shares/mentions (positive, negative, and neutral) is obtained. It was found 
that most of the shares/mentions are neutral and few are considered positive, which leads to the conclusion that there 
are shares/mentions about science and that, despite the lack of detected polarity they can serve as a basis for a scientific 
recommendation.

1. Introduction 
The sharing of scientific knowledge is traditionally carried out through publications in scientific journals or books, 
subject to review, editing, printing, and distribution with long waiting periods between each step, access restrictions, 
and very high membership costs. The development and proliferation of the Internet as an open, free and global 
communication platform presents great potential for science communication. The Internet revolutionized access to 
science and made it possible to bridge the geographical barriers between researchers from different countries and 
research centers, contributing to the development of more effective and productive communication, and guaranteeing 
collective science (Montgomery, 2009). The development of science itself was thus changed with the integration of 
the scientific community in a global network (Silva, 2002) standardized by fields of activity and the constitution of 
transdisciplinary networks of collaboration between different scientific entities and researchers from different areas 
and countries, being reality consortia and partnerships to carry out projects at European and/or international level. The 
flow of scientific communication thus includes the production and publication of the results of the research carried 
out, dissemination to the scientific community and the general public; access to published literature, informal 
communication between researchers themselves, communication with the public, and incorporation of new knowledge 
(Morris & Ogan, 1996). Watermeyer (2010) and Bik & Goldstein (2013) refer that online contact via social networks 
is a two-way contact and allows an informal connection between scientists and between them and the public. 
 
Science can thus be enriched through different representations of scientific knowledge, a multiplicity of opinions, and 
criticisms that are constructed and shared throughout the network. In short, the phenomenon of social networks, as a 
natural consequence of the social character of Man, stands out in the technological means of communication and social 
interaction as a potential tool for accessing, sharing, and disseminating knowledge. 
 
In this way, the increase in scientific publications (in this paper, scientific publications will be called research outputs 
(RO), thus,  an RO can be a journal paper, a conference paper, a book, a chapter of a book, a scientific report, a patent, 
among others) in recent years has led to the need for recommendations on which ROs to read. Usually, the ROs go 
through peer-review processes. The result of the peer-review work is usually not made public, creating an opacity in 
the perception of the relevance of the ROs. Finding the right RO for those looking for a high number of published 
ROs is a complex and arduous task, especially if the person/researcher looking for it is still a beginner in a certain area 
of knowledge. The use of social media platforms means that bibliometric indicators, namely the number of citations, 
traditionally used to assess the relevance of a RO, are complemented with indicators called altmetrics (alternative

and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022

93",,"It is also verified that there are no negative mentions of ROs, and it can be concluded that it is not normal among the 
scientific community to share negative comments regarding works published by peers (authors), especially if the 
authors of these mentions are identified. This is relevant because the peer-review process is normally a blind process, 
i.e., the review author is not known (shown). 
 
It is more usual to share positive comments on what you like, so comments that were considered positive are really 
positive, as they convey an opinion and not just a factual presentation of an RO. It appears that there are many shares 
on Twitter, but most are a mere reference to a RO and do not present any kind of sentiment/opinion (neutral sentiment). 
This research can serve as a basis for a RO recommendation system based on sharing mentions on social media 
platforms. A mention, even a neutral mention, is a reference (recommendation) to a RO and if it is positive then it 
makes that RO even more relevant. 
 
This work has limitations, namely the fact that only one social media platform was used, but as mentioned above, 
access to data from social platforms is increasingly limited. 
 
In future work, it is suggested to study who makes mentions on social networks to identify and understand who are 
the science influencers and what types of recommendations they make.

Abstract 
 
Enterprise resource planning could be discussed for an organization in the SME sector due to the processes required 
to adopt it. On the other side, agile deployment methods contribute to reaching the development and implementation 
objectives based on the user experience through incremental deliverable software components. In this paper, we 
researched the application of the Lean Thinking (Kanban) methodology and Agile Deployment Methods to propose a 
method that collects a set of activities for its implementation. Two scenarios were considered for the UDA - ERP 
software validation:  i) deployment of a software module without an implementation method and ii) deployment of a 
software module applying the proposed method. Consequently, the Servqual and User Experience (SUS) models were 
considered to apply satisfaction surveys to validate the results. The research results led to generating a five stages 
method that involves: i) initial contact with the client, ii) requirement definition, iii) Implementation in a test 
environment, iv) production and v) closure of the implementation project.

1. Introduction 
In Cuenca, Ecuador, a group of research professors from the Universidad del Azuay, developed UDA-ERP software 
for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (for its acronym MSMEs) of this city and the whole region to support 
the planning and managing of business resources. This software focuses on the MSMEs based on the market study 
carried out by Astudillo et al. (2018), which evaluates the number of companies registered by the business sector, 
workers, and annual sales volume. Tinoco (2020) notes that in Cuenca city, 73.5% of MSMEs plan to acquire software 
for business management. Based on the research by Astudillo et al. (2018) for the management and administration of 
the resources of MSMEs, the UDA-ERP software includes the following modules: i) Manufacturing, ii) Inventories, 
iii) General accounting, iv) Cost accounting, v) Purchases, vi) Sales and vii) Human Talent. UDA-ERP was developed

6. Conclusion 
In the proposed method, the implementation activities planning and their monitoring provided greater control by the 
ERP software provider company by incorporating activities schedule and a Kanban board to control the status of each 
one of them. By combining Kanban with Andon, the method got a visual control of the activities and their execution 
status throughout the ERP software implementation, identifying activities objectively in progress or that still does not 
start. The activity error rate will be reduced, and the implementation process will continue following the initial 
planning. The results of the SERVQUAL questionnaire showed that the proposed implementation method offered the 
client a more excellent perception of the service quality offered by the UDA-ERP software implementation team since 
it involves the client in each of the deployment stages.  
 
When applying the SUS questionnaire, the usability of the proposed deployment method is evaluated by the UDA-
ERP software implementation team, who experienced the benefits of the proposed method compared to the current 
method.

Abstract  
 
Increased generation of waste, production of plastics, and poor environmental stewardship has led to an increase in 
floating litter. Significant efforts have been dedicated to mitigating this globally relevant issue. Depending on the 
location of floating litter, removal methods would vary but usually include manual cleanups by volunteers or workers, 
use of heavy machinery to rake or sweep litter off beaches or roads, or passive litter collection traps. In the open ocean 
or streams, a common passive technique is to use booms and a collection receptacle to trap floating litter. These passive

Abstract 
 
People are becoming more aware of environmental issues such as climate change and pollution. As a result, consumers 
are increasingly becoming more environmentally conscious of their products. The current challenge for every industry 
today is to find a more sustainable and ethical way to produce goods. Brands must improve their marketing as its 
elements (people, price, product, and place) are crucial to respond to this challenge. The researchers identify the 
relationship between green products and packaging to consumers' purchasing behavior in this study. The factors 
included are environmental concerns/beliefs/values; environmental awareness and knowledge of the environmental 
impact of products and their packaging; social media influence; availability of a product in location; pricing; and 
product quality and benefits. The researchers utilized online survey questionnaires and assessed the relationship 
through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), using SPSS. The findings indicate that the pricing and product quality, 
including the benefits, of green cosmetics, personal care products, and packaging affect consumers' purchasing 
behavior in Luzon, Philippines. The study provides new insights into Filipino consumers' perceptions of the 
environment. Introducing sustainable solutions to meet consumers' demand in purchasing cosmetic and personal care 
products will also have a vital impact and opportunities on the industry. The researchers suggest that companies should 
produce more green products in the market since the customers are more concerned about the ingredients of the 
product they consume and willing to invest more in sustainable products. Moreover, considering the significant factors 
of the study proved to be an effective marketing strategy.

1. Introduction 
Cosmetics started in ancient Egypt, as Egyptians believed that one should always look presentable at any celebration 
they would attend, which is why one's hygiene became an essential concern for most people there (Mark 2017). 
Although Cosmetics and Personal Care Products, from consumers' perspective, as they thought it was just make-up 
and perfumes, the researchers would like to emphasize that this is not limited to these. Under the law, everyday 
products such as (but not limited to) shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, skin moisturizers, and deodorants were considered 
a part of the Cosmetics and Personal Care Industry. Today, the cosmetics industry's importance is related to its impact 
on everyone's life in beautification and its contribution to the global GDP. Likewise, the Cosmetics Industry in the 
Philippines has been booming recently. Multiple brands have been releasing innovative products in the market, from 
make-ups to everyday personal care such as shampoos and soaps. 
 
The researchers have found that the fluctuation in demand for skin care products is related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which causes people to be more aware of their hygiene because of the pandemic (Allied Market Research 2020).

119",,"Pricing 
To further back up the result that pricing is a significant latent variable: According to Sharaf et al. (2018), the product's 
price has always been a substantial factor in the purchasing behavior of the consumers. It has also been an indicator 
to inform the market about the product's value. Many consumers nowadays are willing to spend an extra price if the 
product carries an additional value and helps take environmental protection (Yue et al. 2020). Moreover, a recent 
study (Zhang et al. 2020) stated that the price of green products in the market is relatively higher than that of traditional 
products. Hence, they are still growing in the market because consumers are more concerned about the impact of their 
purchased products. 
 
Product Quality and Its Benefits 
As mentioned in the results, the product quality and its benefits variables are also significant. A similar study 
(Alamsyah 2020) stated that green marketing helps to improve the green awareness of the consumers, leading to 
purchasing green products. The researchers observed that most companies started to adapt their business strategy to 
use green marketing and green packaging initiatives due to societal pressures derived from consumers' purchasing 
behavior and environmental concern. Thus, sustainable products and packaging are a new concept that has attracted 
consumers' attention in recent years (Wandosell et al. 2021). 
 
Lastly, this study's significance aims to benefit both consumers and producers. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) 
showed companies would do this. On the producers' side, the findings of this paper state that consumers are willing to 
pay more for greener personal care products. With that, despite investing in research and development, they will still 
be able to actualize an income increase as more people adapt to sustainable consumerism. Meanwhile, for the 
consumers, the study will benefit them as it shows producers that they are demanding better quality products that offer 
beneficial changes to their lives. Branding and advertisement are just one part of attracting consumers but giving good 
quality products will make the consumers purchase repeatedly.

Abstract 
From a systemic managerial perspective or ideology allowed for contemporary companies through Re-engineered 4th 
Generation Management (Hallioui et al., 2022)—sustainability, competitiveness, and productivity are crucial matters 
for each company worldwide to strive as a whole to achieve its strategic goals. We expect that will shortly make a 
broad debate and framework for an increasingly growing number of research works in the business world and 
academia. Furthermore, that motivated us to open the research interval to the system approach to transit from the

129",,"company’s behavior management to the structure of production systems, indeed, from a managerial application for the 
company to the equipment structure and that of the mechanical system, particularly. Therefore, this paper aims to 
suggest a new, innovative, and dynamic method to apply to mechanical systems for systemic decision-making in 
maintenance and acting efficiently on the impact of their failures and limiting its consequences on the production 
processes where these mechanical systems or their subsets are operated. This method is called Structural Systemic 
Method (SSM) and is based on Fault Tree Analysis and contemporary maintenance or non-systematic proactive 
maintenance strategies (e.g., condition-based and predictive maintenance). It is an answer to a two-fold research gap, 
the limitations of Failure Tree Analysis as a quasi-systemic technic and the only structural method in maintenance 
literature to deal with parts’ failures; and systematic preventive maintenance (i.e., time-based maintenance) as a 
traditional maintenance strategy. In other words, Structural Systemic Method is a failure interaction, prevention, and 
detection-based maintenance method that will deal with a part’s impact on the neighboring parts of the same 
mechanical subset. The expected results of this work as a pioneer to present SSM are allowing systemic decision-
making in maintenance; adapting the maintenance function to the need of contemporary companies within their current 
context of Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and Diverse Stakeholders (Hallioui et al., 2022); reducing 
the number of maintenance interventions; reducing the maintenance costs; optimizing the maintenance resources; 
enhancing the maintenance efficiency and value for companies; increasing the understanding of complex systems’ 
maintenance, and improving the mechanical systems’ performance; and proving the SSM’s ability to predict the failure 
root causes’ impact of a part on other ones on a well-determined interacting subsystem as early and quickly as possible 
while considering the holistic behavior of mechanical systems, which contributes directly to improving their 
dependability, and therefore their effectiveness and longevity over time.

Abstract 
 
Maintaining public green spaces is vital for health, safety, and hygiene, especially when the green areas are neglected 
and are not in optimal conditions. An efficient schedule of fleets for the maintenance of green areas is necessary to 
maintain a healthy environment. This paper presents the analysis of a mixed-integer linear optimization model for 
optimal maintenance scheduling, which takes into account factors such as weed growth and sequencing. A comparison 
between traditional methods and the proposed model is made, measuring the use of resources. Lastly, a case study of 
a specific area in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico is presented to demonstrate the benefits of a proper maintenance 
schedule.

Abstract 
 
The resident students at the University of New Haven have been complaining of long wait times when picking of their 
mails and packages from the mailroom.  There is only one central mailroom operating non-holiday weekdays from 
8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.  The mail/package dispensing is handled through one window staffed by a mail clerk who 
handles other mailroom tasks when no one is waiting at the pick-up window.   The one waiting line for pick up grows 
so large at times that some students miss their classes, meetings, lunches, and other very important obligations so as 
to not have to come back for another waiting episode at the mailroom queue! The student authors (1st and 2nd) selected 
the improvement of the mailroom operation as their graduate degrees capstone projects with guidance and advising 
from the 3rd author.  The mailroom operation was thoroughly studied and modeled using discrete event simulation 
with ARENA.  Some of the needed data were obtained from the mailroom management while others were collected 
by observation.  A preliminary and first approximation of the model has already been developed, verified, and 
validated to mirror the actual mailroom operation on a given workday.  There were multitude challenges from data 
availability and data integrity to the picks and valleys in demand (students’ pickups) to mail/package arrivals by 
different carriers. The biggest modeling challenge has been matching of the students with their packages (one or more 
which is probabilistic) and the team is currently working to implement that scenario.  Other than the scarcity of the 
resources, both physical (windows) and human (mailroom dispensing clerk), there appears to be job design issues, 
which would require further study in terms of facility design and operations management.  The presentation at the 
conference will review the entirety of the project from data collection to model building and testing to the ARENA 
model(s), the study findings, and the recommendations for the improvement of the mailroom operation.

Abstract  
 
Recent events unveiled that it has become eminent to understand the wide dimensions of the supply chains disturbance 
and how to mitigate its effect on the performance. The complexity of globally stretched supply chains of different 
products and specifically agricultural food supply chains have increased the sensitivity of the performance if any 
disturbances occur. This paper reviews the literature from 2017 concerned with resilience in supply chains and agro 
food supply chains, with the aim of building a complete understanding of the methods and strategies to deal with 
disruptions. The review classifies the risks, decision variables, and objectives (with a deeper look on resilience and 
sustainability measures) considered for both general and agro food supply chains to reach a conclusion on the most 
appropriate strategies. The different model types are addressed together with the appropriate solution techniques to 
reach an optimum performance for the model. We identified the research gaps and highlighted the different research 
paths that are scarce in literature. The results show the dearth in research on agro food supply chains and application 
of the models on real case studies. Sustainability is rarely addressed and linked with resilience. Limited research 
addressed resilience as a performance measure although it is of great importance, while a few considered the tradeoff 
between financial and resilience measures.

Nowadays, the novel supply chains in our emerging global economy are interconnected and complex. This is mostly 
due to the articulation of research about the benefits of adapting strategies like global outsourcing, manufacturing in 
global destinations, supply base rationalization, just-in-time deliveries, and many more. Companies could not look 
over the advantages of these strategies but applying them shed the light to new complications that the chains are now

135","4.4 Gap Analysis   
Noticeable gaps have been recognized from works of studied literature that point to important future research ideas. 
A significant gap exists for applying models in different industries like agricultural and energy and adaptation of ASC 
research on a specific food type. More research is needed that develop case studies with real company data on applying 
resilience frameworks to validate the suggested research work. The following problems should be addressed:  
 
Risks: Consider post disruption period when designing and the revival policies. 
 
Strategies: Design strategies and models around the disruption phases and the time lags between them. 
 
Decision variables: Models should take into considerations transportation modes and routes decisions as 
variables since they can drastically reduce risks and increase resilience. ASC research should study the 
number of facilities as a variable to increase resilience.  
 
Objectives: Develop appropriate measures to quantify resilience and sustainability as an objective. 
 
Sustainability: Study the three levels of sustainability with resilience to quantify their impact. To the 
researcher’s knowledge, there is currently limited work on agro-food extended to the full chain from farm to 
customer that has sustainability and resilience as objectives. 
 
Modeling techniques: Extend the models to be multi-period, multi objective models by using multi stage 
modelling under uncertainty. There should be more studies on the impact of digitalization, big data analytics 
on resilience: How to make use of available digital technology like simulation and digital twins improve 
resilience. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study presents a review of supply chain resilience to mitigate the effect of disruption in general and agro-food 
supply chains and to contribute to the call of several scholars  (Ana Estesoa, 2018), (Bottani, 2019), (Hosseini, 2019) 
and (Adbor, 2020). Although the emphasis is on getting a deeper understanding of the concept of resilience, its 
strategies and important aspects, this work also concentrates on how researchers introduced a resilient supply chain 
design, how their work was formulated and implemented, what decision variables were considered, how the work was 
solved to find the optimum configuration and in some cases applied on a specific chain. SCR is a disruption driven 
notion that requires precise configurations, thus findings reveal that numerous strategies are efficient in the face of 
disruptions, like scenarios to choose between the strategies and combining proactive and reactive strategy is 
recommended. The reactive strategy that has the most positive influence on the chain is having a capacity buffer, 
whereas the proactive strategy is investing in technology to provide visibility. The review proved that the decision 
variable is always linked to the strategy, supplier and capacity decisions are critical for designing a resilient supply 
chain, whereas decisions concerning the product flow have been widely addressed for ASC and showed great 
improvements in performance. The objective function is oriented towards the financial objective of cost minimization, 
and to a smaller extent, maximization of service level which is interrelated to the resilience. Critical objectives for 
ASC are of waste, controlling this objective reduces costs and increases resilience in most cases. Furthermore, having 
the objective of minimizing lead time has positive influence on the ASC resilience, the successful model for these 
type of chains mostly has a dual objective of financial and customer orientation. The highly successful models are the 
ones who dealt with the fact that disruption effect is gradual, consequently variables studied should be formulated into 
a two stage linear programming model that will later be optimized with the help of a software. Finally, the findings 
provide that a stochastic model is most commonly formulated and solution is reached by solving it on CPLEX solver 
in the GAMS software.

Abstract 
 
The traditional software space (1.0) has seen more than fifty years of creation, testing, and delivery of deterministic 
software, but this tradition is being disrupted by machine learning (2.0). However, ML and traditional software are 
considerably different, and the nascent ML industry uses unique workflows and toolsets for both life cycles. This “one 
foot in each raft” scenario forces companies to support duplicate resources which are essentially doing the same thing. 
This paper proposes an answer to the research question: Can software 2.0 quality assurance be performed effectively 
using the same process as 1.0? A systematic literature review was performed and process documents from a machine 
learning company reviewed. 132 papers were selected and refined to 24. ML process documents supported what is an 
industry standard ML life cycle. While the literature review shows a gap relative to holistic QA solutions for ML 
products, process documents showed the answer to the research question is...perhaps, since it was determined that the 
typical ML life cycle can be mapped to the standard software 1.0 life cycle. This paper proposes using that mapping 
to extend an existing 1.0 QA process architecture, the Quality Assurance Machine (QAM), to effectively manage both 
1.0 and 2.0 QA.

1. Introduction 
The software industry is in transition: The traditional space, software 1.0, has seen more than fifty years of creation, 
testing, and delivery of deterministic software, but this tradition is being disrupted by the stochastic model of software 
2.0. Data driven software development, a paradigm shift, feeds massive amounts of cleaned and curated data to models 
which create software to solve previously unsolvable problems. The computer is no longer told what and how to do 
something, it is told what the answer should be, then given data and a model to create software to arrive at it. These 
ideas are not new, they are decades old. What is new, and what has turned ideas into reality, is the introduction of big 
data and more than a doubling of compute power. Digitally connected systems produce 2.5 quintillion (i.e., 2.5×1018) 
bytes of data per day, and some is used by software 2.0. Compute power comes courtesy of the gaming industry: 
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) developed to enable graphics and video rendering was the power needed to process 
big data and unleash the mystery of machine learning (ML). Mystery, because the algorithms created by ML are 
complicated and difficult for humans to understand, and details of how answers are created are not well known. ML 
solutions tend to be a complex black box, and this has created issues for companies developing, and anxiety for those 
using, the solutions. Software 1.0 has a rich set of processes and tools for development and quality assurance which 
have grown over decades. However, 2.0 is very new, and a problem faced by the industry is 2.0 quality assurance 
processes and tools, those which give companies and consumers confidence, are lagging.  
 
Within industry, machine learning model development follows a pattern: acquire, clean, and curate data, train and test 
a model, deploy the model. This process, while not backed by industry standard tools and processes, is common. 
However, ML models do not typically exist in isolation. A current deployment method for software 2.0 is to wrap ML 
models with software 1.0 infrastructure, thus creating reliance on both technologies simultaneously. But ML and 
traditional software are considerably different and require unique workflows and toolsets. This “one foot in each raft” 
scenario forces companies to support resources which, at a high level, are doing the same thing: creating and delivering 
software. This paper answers the research question: Can quality assurance be performed effectively for ML solutions

147","are like software 1.0’s RDDTR. Gathering information to determine which data to acquire, clean, and curate is a 
Requirements concern. Cleaning and curating data is a step necessary to begin training a model and can be seen as a 
Design deliverable. Training a model is Development and Test, and deploying a model is Test and Release. Each ML 
life cycle phase maps to software 1.0’s general phases of RDDTR.  
 
While the literature review shows a research gap relative to holistic QA solutions for ML products, the review of ML 
process documents and the mapping of ML life cycle to software 1.0’s life cycle showed the answer to the research 
question is...perhaps. It is believed that extending the QAM to support ML will accomplish two things initially: 
elimination of two QA workflows, and QA for ML products. Elimination of two workflows is an obvious benefit, but 
QA for ML products, the rigorous and consistent conformance to process specifications by a machine and not by a 
team occasionally ignored, is an empirical benefit. As noted, model testing is not a primary concern of this proposal, 
but the QAM architecture inherently supports all phases necessary for developing and executing model tests (TAe, 
TDe, TEe, and DOe). Using the QAM to support model test development and execution is a future, attainable, concern. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The software industry is changing, rapidly. Software 1.0, traditional deterministic solutions that have been created for 
decades, is being disrupted by 2.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Quality assurance is not keeping pace 
with this rapid change. Research appears to be grasping the shiny 2.0 object, as there is a lack of quality assurance 
solutions for combined 1.0 and 2.0 products, which is a typical deployment of ML models. The Quality Assurance 
Machine (QAM) can fill this gap. Results of mapping the traditional software life cycle, RDDTR, to the ML life cycle, 
show an overlap which can be supported by extending the QAM. This effort would relieve ML software companies 
of the duplicative effort of supporting two lifecycles performing the same function.

Abstract  
 
Customer Satisfaction is the key factor of any organization's success. There is a lack of concerns on the relation 
between the Internal Organizational Factors and their effect on  Customer Satisfaction for Virtual E-Organizations. 
This study examines the interrelations between Organizational Factors such as Employee Satisfaction and 
Communication satisfaction and how those two factors influence Customer Satisfaction as an indication of the 
Usability for Virtual/E-Organizations. Two online surveys were used. The First one was an attempt to discover the 
relationship between Communication Satisfaction and Employee Job Satisfaction. The second one was the Customer 
satisfaction survey. This survey was sent to Customers of seven different types of Virtual\ E-Organizations. 
Hypotheses were tested by conducting Regression analysis to investigate the relation between Variables. Data were 
analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25. The results show that Communication and Employee satisfaction were highly 
correlated. Additionally, Customer Satisfaction was Correlated with Employee Satisfaction with a high correlation. 
Also, communication and customer satisfaction were moderately correlated. The findings suggest that good 
communication between employees can create reasonable Employee Satisfaction, subsequently improving customer 
satisfaction.

1. Introduction  
In Today's Industry of rapidly growing interfaces, Virtual\E-organizations are expected to be one of the promising 
organizational forms in this Internet cultural era(Gil, Berenguer et al. 2008). E-organizations are organizations 
established and operated based on the Internet and other related technologies in an Internet culture environment. 
Whereby organizations will be placing the Internet at the center of their Business (Azumah, Koh et al. 2009). E-
organization is defined by the degree to which it uses global (Internet) and private (intranet and extranet) network 
linkages. According to the heaviness of Internet usage.

6. Conclusion  
This study focused on Virtual E-Organizations and their customer satisfaction as an indication of usability 
measurement. This study linked two Internal organizational factors with Customer Satisfaction. Those factors are 
Employee Satisfaction and Communication Satisfaction. Three hypotheses were tested to check those relations. The 
first hypothesis, which links communication satisfaction and employee, shows a significant relationship between 
communication satisfaction and employee satisfaction with p=0.000 with correlation coefficient = 0.774**, which 
means high correlation. The second hypothesis, which links employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction, shows 
a significant relationship between them with p=0.004 and correlation coiffeicient=0.534**, which means highly 
correlated. The last hypothesis, which links between communication satisfaction and customer satisfaction, shows a 
significant relationship with p=0.026 and correlation coiffecient=0.371 **, which means moderately correlated. So 
the conclusion is that for virtual organizations to increase their customer satisfaction, they should increase two 
internal organizational factors: employee satisfaction and communication satisfaction. And to increase their 
Employee satisfaction, they should increase the communication satisfaction of their employees.

Abstract 
 
Electrical accidents wound and kill a lot of people in the ready-made garment (RMG) industries of Bangladesh 
every year. Regular electrical safety inspections and prioritization of the identified significant risk factors can 
effectively minimize the occurrence of these electrical accidents. This study proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision-
Making (MCDM) based framework to prioritize the frequently observed significant electrical risk factors in the 
RMG industries of Bangladesh to aid the decision-makers to ensure a safe and sustainable workplace. In this study, 
26 most significant electrical risk factors have been identified from the opinions of 12 experts who have analyzed 
the electrical safety inspection reports accumulated from 100 different RMG industries. After that, the Best Worst 
Method (BWM) has been applied to find the weights of the three evaluation criteria- Consequence, Likelihood, and 
Manageability, based on the expert feedback. Then, a Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) 
method has been utilized to get the final ranking of the risk factors. The existence of hot spots detected by thermal 
imaging, improper support and protection for hanging cables, and heat source adjacent to electrical installations have 
been determined as the most prioritized electrical risk factors for the RMG industries. The findings of this research 
are expected to help the managers and other decision-makers of RMG industries to devise effective mitigation 
strategies to minimize the electrical safety risks efficiently and hierarchically.

RMG sector of Bangladesh is one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the world, consisting of around 4.4 
million people working in more than 4500 industries (Fathi, 2021; Statista, 2021). This is also one of the 
accident-prone industries which have faced many injurious and fatal accidents in the last three decades. 
Fatality from the electrical and chemical fire incidents is the highest, compared to other workplace hazards, in 
this sector (Hasan et al., 2017). Such a noteworthy accident is the fire incident in the Tazreen Fashions Ltd. in 
2012 due to an electrical fault, which was one of the deadliest accidents in the country’s history causing more 
than 100 deaths and more than 300 injuries (Wiersma, 2018). Studies show that most of the fire incidents in

Abstract  
 
The challenge in aggregate production planning for high-tech manufacturing industries such as aerospace, 
semiconductor manufacturing, or high precision components production is the variability in cycle times or cycle steps 
due to the rework required to meet very high levels (6-sigma) of quality. This variability at the lower planning level 
needs to be accounted for in aggregate planning level. Planning circularity, whereby cycle time depends on resource 
utilization while resource utilization is determined by cycle time continues to be an important problem in the aggregate 
planning literature. It is well known that ignoring congestion, as is the case in MRP-II based systems still widely in 
use, is inaccurate. In the presence of congestion, the relationship of WIP and throughput is nonlinear and bottleneck 
resources may shift constantly. The most common approach of addressing the nonlinear relationship between the WIP 
and the throughput is through the clearing function. Recent work by Omar et al. (2017) proposed a mixed-integer 
linear model for closed queuing production networks using fixed release planning. The challenge with this model is 
that it is difficult to scale up for typically sized problems scalability. This work extends the approach in Omar et al.

From the results of MAPR, we can see that the differences between values from the NLP model and simulation are 
acceptable. 
 
6. Conclusions and Future Study 
In this paper, a NLP model was developed for aggregate production planning by directly inserting the formula for 
system throughput under the Jackson open-queuing network assumption. Numerical results show promise. In future 
work, several cases from the literature need to be evaluated for accuracy, scalability, computational feasibility with 
previous approaches in the literature.

Abstract  
 
Food is a valuable commodity due to its necessity to satisfy human hunger and enable human 
growth. One does not frequently know what to eat and depend exclusively, on what they see and 
read about on a product's label, and may end up consuming unsafe flavorings and coloring. Flavors 
are characterized by a material's sensory analysis; natural flavors generally means essential oils. 
Artificial flavors, on the other hand, are made of various compounds that react and form a specific 
concentrate flavor. For the purpose of this study, natural strawberry flavors from a selected 
company was compared with artificial flavors created in a laboratory, using sensory, Refractive 
Index (RI) and Specific Gravity (SG), and consumers’ perception analyses. It was observed that 
both SG and RI are higher in artificial flavor compared to natural one, indicating artificial flavor 
to be more viscous. Furthermore, the result indicated that consumers preferred natural flavor over 
artificial flavor.

1. Introduction 
 
In the second half of the twentieth century, regulatory attention was fixated on the flavor industries, after an influx of 
sweeteners, additives, flavorings and other ingredients added to processed food. The regulatory authorities had to ban 
the utilization of harmful chemicals and ingredients in foods, however, before utilizing a new additive, food industries 
were required to demonstrate lack of harm (Nielsen, 2015). In the 1950s, hundreds of additives, sweeteners, flavorings 
and colors were for commercial use, and no health warning were investigated at that point (van Zwanenburg and 
Millstone, 2015). 
 
The management of Food Safety and Quality was regulated by three main government departments, namely the 
Department of Health (DoH), Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The DoH 
oversees food hygiene and issues certificates of acceptability to manufactures. They also develop food safety and 
quality standards ensuring that food industries comply with labelling, nutritional and fortification requirements. As

190","5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
This study focused on strawberry flavor obtained from a wholesale store compared to the artificial flavor generated in 
a laboratory. Flavor extraction is the most difficult procedure, due to the volatility of the chemical composition of the 
flavor. Most research studies used the GCMS method for extraction, which allows volatile and semi-volatiles to be 
injected in the equipment.  
 
Both SG and RI results for the natural strawberry flavor were lower than the artificial flavor. This is due to the fact 
that an artificial flavor is compounded with all different raw materials, and therefore, it is heavier than the natural 
flavor. The RI analysis indicated that the light that passed through the artificial flavor took additional time to be 
refracted. RI seemed to increase with SG for both natural and artificial flavors.  
 
Although literature shows that there are regulations that govern flavor additives, it was observed that consumers are 
less educated about food regulations. South Africa has governing bodies and regulations in place, that enforces flavor 
industries to avoid food fraud and enhance food safety. The DoH is responsible for enforcing the laws, but it is 
identified that the regulations are not policied.  Furthermore, there are insufficient environmental Health and Safety 
Officers in each municipalities whom can ensure that issues such as the listeria breakout do not occur. This is a huge 
gap and affects consumers, even when the consumer protection service exists but do not communicate with consumers 
effectively. 
 
Furthermore, it was observed that very few consumers are knowledgeable when it comes to the origin of flavors, how 
they are derived and integrated into food to deliver quality food products. Consumers have limited knowledge on 
flavor education, thus it was very difficult to get honest tasting responses from untrained consumers. Nevertheless, 
the consumers preferred the natural sample when they tasted it. The natural flavor was perceived to be healthier as 
compared to artificial flavor. They concluded that the sample had a very fruity taste and aroma. They expressed that 
they would recommend it to be used in the processing of yoghurt. The artificial flavor had an alcohol taste and aroma, 
mostly due to maturity level of the flavor. 
 
5.1 Recommendations 
 
It is recommended that food manufactures label their products such that consumers are able to understand the contents 
of the food product. Food manufactures should use language that is easily interpreted. Consumer protection agencies 
should conduct research in Africa as it is very difficult to get relevant research conducted in the continent and most 
consumer research findings are from an international perspective.  
 
It is also evident that artificial flavors plays a vital role in maturation levels, however this study did not consider 
comparing flavors using matured artificial flavor. When the sample was prepared for tasting, the flavor had not yet 
settled to produce rounded fruity taste and aroma, therefore it is recommended that similar studies can be conducted 
with an artificial flavor that has been preserved for weeks to mature and compared with the natural flavor.  
 
Natural and artificial flavors were compared using the RI and SG method with satisfactory results. However, further 
statistical analysis can be performed for comparison. It was also observed that consumers have little knowledge about 
the food they eat, its content and how it is processed, hence more research studies needs to be performed to prove to 
the DOH, food agencies, consumer services that consumer education is very important.

Abstract  
 
Disengaged employees typically cost corporations an estimated $350 billion annually. The negative effects on 
productivity could be caused by negative interpersonal behaviours that lower employee engagement. It was found that 
only thirteen percent (13%) of worldwide employees are fully engaged at work. In addition, twice as many are so 
disengaged that this negative behaviour is spread to other employees. Alternatively, leaders who incorporate strategic 
employee engagement behaviours experience higher employee productivity, further reinforcing the notion that 
organisational productivity is largely determined by employees’ efforts and levels of engagement. Cost of disengaged 
employees in the South African content has not been determined. It can be safely stated that with productivity levels 
being amongst the worst in developing economies, disengaged employees are costing the economy a substantial 
amount of money, which translates to over-priced products, which in-turn leads to un-competitiveness. In this 
challenging operational environment in South African organisations, getting employees to willingly move in a unified 
direction is not an easy task. Moreover, getting them to remain engaged to the task at hand, is even more challenging. 
This study uses a case study methodology to evaluate employee engagement in a fast-moving consumer goods 
environment.  The results shows a high correlation of employee engagement with successful, sustainable and 
productive organizations. This in-turn forms the foundation for organizations to leverage human capital into a truly 
competitive advantage. Disengaged employees negatively affects productivity and overall organizational 
performance.  Therefore, employers can undertake to create an environment that invariably fosters and stimulates 
employee engagement.

205","6.  Conclusion 
The conclusion is that the company review employee requirements and develop a CWP to improve the overall wellness 
of the workforce, which will see a subsequent improvement in organisational productivity. These programs are by far 
not a “one size fits all”, thus HR management should embark on a detailed fact-finding mission to establish the current 
state and plan accordingly.  The research has affirmed the relationship between employee engagement and 
organisational performance. Evidence from both primary sources and the literature review categorically align 
improved business performance to employee engagement. They seem to form a symbiotic relationship and one can’t 
exist without the other. One can always argue that organisational performance is determined by other factors such as 
economic conditions, availability of technology, changes in customer or consumer preference and it would be difficult 
to refute this argument. What this research has shown is that organisations stand a much better chance of creating 
sustainable performance if their workforce is highly engaged.  For the organisation in question, the researcher has 
made sound recommendations for management to consider as key aspects of their HR strategy. Armed with this 
information, the leadership can seek to improve the levels of engagement at the operational site and if implemented 
correctly, they should see an improvement in overall organisational performance. This strategy can be used as a blue-
print to execute across other operational sites.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, the Quebec government has highlighted the importance of making decisions that are both sustainable 
and robust under climate change uncertainties. This paper aims to answer the following question: How to sort the 
alternatives according to their degree of sustainability achievement while evaluations are uncertain and temporal? 
The general objective of the paper is to propose a first temporal sorting method under stochastic uncertainty. The 
proposed method, called TSMAA-Tri, will assign each alternative to a predefined category based on a generalization 
of SMAA-Tri to a temporal context (multi-period evaluation of alternatives) where alternative evaluations are 
stochastic. The method starts performing Monte Carlo simulations to generate stochastic evaluation values. Each 
simulation (scenario of uncertainty) will generate a specific value for each criterion using the corresponding 
probability distribution. Then, aggregation consists in applying SMAA Tri at each period and performing a triple 
aggregation: i) uncertainty aggregation; ii) multi-criteria aggregation; and ii) temporal aggregation. Multi-criteria 
aggregation consists in applying the SMAA-TRI method at each period. Then, two ways of temporal aggregation are 
proposed, based either on acceptability index or on outranking index of boundary profile. The proposed method is 
illustrated for sustainable forest management to show its applicability.

Abstract  
 
This paper proposes a conceptual model that explains the determinants of vaccination intention. The conceptual model 
is developed based on the integration of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), 
Conspiracy Theory (CT), Knowledge, Attitude/Beliefs, Practice Theory (KABP), Extended Parallel Process Model 
(EPPM) and Health Belief Model (HBM). This study consisted of five steps: literature review, gap-analysis, 
formulation of the conceptual model, expert validation, and pilot test of the model. This paper offers twenty-one 
propositions explaining the relationship between vaccination intention and the thirteen-predictor variables. The pilot 
test found sixty-seven indicators are valid and fourteen variables are reliable. This finding can be used as an initial 
overview before applying the proposed conceptual model on a larger scale in the Indonesian context.

1. Introduction 
COVID-19 has killed more than 5,9 million people worldwide (WHO, 2022). Economic growth declined drastically 
(8%), and the unemployment rate increased by 3.22% (WorldBank, 2021). Schools were forced to close, and online 
teaching and learning process activities were conducted (UNESCO, 2021). This condition causes psychological 
problems, such as depression, poor concentration, and difficulty interacting to obtain proper learning (Selvaraj et al., 
2021). Then the impact on the social sector, namely: domestic violence, increased anxiety, and the emergence of fear 
in the community (de Figueiredo et al., 2021). Those conditions similarly happen in the Indonesian context.  
 
The Indonesian government carried out a vaccination program to overcome this problem. In the process, two problems 
arise—firstly, the problem of the COVID-19 virus variant and the type of vaccine. Recently, two doses of vaccines 
have been considered less effective for the Omicron; the latest COVID-19 variant and booster vaccination program 
was carried out (Covid-19 task force, 2021). Secondly, some people refuse to get vaccinated (Mesa-vieira et al., 2021). 
The survey results show that the level of acceptance of the Indonesian people towards vaccination remains low 
(64.8%); the remaining 27.6% hesitated to accept or refuse vaccination, and 7.6% refused to be vaccinated (Ministry 
of Health, 2021). The main reasons for these refusals include vaccine safety, effectiveness, fear of side effects, and

Abstract 
 
The strive to sustainexcellencewithinorganizationshasincreasedwiththeconstantchange in customer demands and 
toughening of competition. With these rapid changes occurring, the need for organizations to be agile has become a 
significant element in their operation schemes to sustain the excellence and be future-ready. This need raises the 
question of the relationship between organizational excellence and agility. Various models and frameworks have 
been developed to achieve excellence and agility in organizations. However, limited studies have correlated the two. 
This research investigates the relationship between excellence and agility within organizations and develops an 
assessment correlation index matrix between the two domains. That will help organizations understand their states in 
agility and excellence. The out-take for an organization is to know its categorization in the correlation model 
(beginner, master, conservative or fashionist) and determine the under-achieving pillars in each domain. The results of 
the study have shown that there is a high positive correlation between the two domains in both the public and private 
organizations. Although while one would expect that private organizations would have higher correlation between 
the two domains, it has been observed in this study that public organizations within the UAE have shown higher 
correlation data. This could be attributed to the fact that the Government of the UAE has introduced various 
initiatives since the 90’s that encouraged public organizations to implement excellence models such as DQA and 
SKEA. Moreover, the study has shown that regardless of the size of the company, the correlation between agility and 
excellence is highly positive.

Abstract 
 
Virtual Economies continue to be a global phenomenon, and cryptocurrency is prominent in this process, and it can be 
attained by playing blockchains. The rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is also increasing the demand for Ethereum. 
Thus, these features encourage many people to earn money while playing it that even young people (most likely 
undergraduate students) invest. There is no doubt that it is a good business for financial risk and problems, it also provides 
much more significant opportunities and applications. Somehow the notions of blockchain technology provides some 
negative outcomes, specifically in the behavioral aspects of them. In this paper, the researchers focused on 
socioeconomic status and behavioral aspects of the players and considered these two as the factors in their perspective 
about the blockchain games. The results on socioeconomic shows that most of them are playing because of financial 
problems and sees this as an opportunity to have an income. The results on Behavioral impacts through pareto analysis 
shows that most respondents suffer from the negative impact of playing blockchain games, 66% of the respondents has 
lack of sleep, 53.5% less focus in studies, 39.5% less interactive and more. Tukey method is also use to analysis whether 
which questions is significantly important in terms of obtaining and analysis the results from the survey conducted. In 
conclusion the socioeconomic stand is likely to affect their perspective in the blockchain games and shows that these 
games can lead to addiction because of the time spend in playing, the anxiety with the game and other negative 
outcomes.

1. Introduction 
Virtual Economies continue to be a global phenomenon. Industries worldwide seek more possible ways to incorporate 
this frankly advanced technology into their core services and products. Frequently, the world's connectivity is not 
happening in the cornered room, but sometimes in virtual environments, where people have access all over the world. 
In 2020, people witnessed several economies and industries shutting down due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and paved 
the way to the booming industry in the Business of Gaming as people naturally turn to seek various entertainment 
within their homes. Particularly online gaming has become a breeding ground for interesting innovation in this virtual 
space. Developers invent various new methods to leverage cryptos to purchase and trade in-game products, unlock 
different characters, exchange currency, and eventually make more money. Some developers are prompted to create 
software for virtual trading and business transaction systems. Hence, cryptocurrency is prominent in this process, and 
it can be attained by playing blockchains. According to Suleman (2019) study’s with uncertainty, blockchain 
technology has allowed cryptocurrencies to emerge. Like the US dollar, cryptocurrency is also a medium of exchange. 
However, it is digital and encrypted to control the formation of multiple currency units. This particular technology has 
enabled companies around the world to make secure payments with complete records. Besides, earning while playing 
from blockchain games is attainable by the cryptocurrency called ""Ethereum,"" It is used as the virtual money currency 
in DApps (Decentralized Applications). Radar (2021) study’s with uncertainty, states that Open Sea, Uniswap, and 
Axie Infinity are the leading and top Ethereum DApps. The monetary unit for Ethereum is called ""ether,"" wherein it

6. Conclusion 
This section discusses the conclusion based on the results in the previous chapter, which is supported by statistical 
tools, data from the survey, and online discussion group. In this paper, the socioeconomic status and behavioral aspects 
of the players were focused. The researchers considered these two as the factors in their perspective about the 
blockchain games. At this juncture, the socioeconomic stand of the respondents has a significant role in playing 
blockchain games. Despite of their socio-economic status, these players tend to earn money to help their family and 
for their personal wants and needs (as the respondents said in the online discussion group). Thus, their socioeconomic 
stand is likely to affect their perspective in the blockchain games. On the other hand, the researchers conclude that 
blockchain games are likely (Figure 5.1.6.) to affect the behavioral aspects of the respondents. It shows that these 
games can relate to other online games (such as DOTA, League of Legends, CrossFire, etc.) that can lead to addiction 
since they play blockchain games three (3) hours and above every day, feel anxiety with game results, annoyed when 
the game is interrupted, etc. The researchers also found out that internet connection may affect the behavior of player 
(Figure 5.1.12). In this reason, Blockchain games can be a source of stress. However, blockchain games have positive 
outcomes for the players. Based on the result from the Pareto Analysis, having an investment is the primary positive

requires recommendations. 
 
6.1. Proposed Improvements  
• 
Players of blockchain games must have terms and conditions letter to prevent scams and attain profitability or 
good investment since it will serve as the guidelines for both parties (managers and scholars). 
• 
Both players and managers must have adequate knowledge and acumen about cryptocurrency and trading to 
understand more the money cycle in this aspect. 
• 
Create a to-do list virtually rather than in writing in sticky notes or notepad paper. Most of the players used their 
devices like mobile phones and personal computers and this reason will show that pinning to-do virtually is more 
effective since they can notify easily. This recommendation will help them to attain time management. 
• 
Watch online streams to motivate and relax them. Also, this will help the users to gain knowledge and strategies

Abstract 
 
Solar power generation has increased exponentially in the last decade. It is expected to play an essential role in 
generating renewable energy in the United States and the world in the future. One of the critical points for the return 
on investment of photovoltaic systems is to maximize energy generation. Yet, a problem exists in that solar energy 
systems do not have a monitoring system for all components, so there is no way to know, in real-time, if the solar 
energy system is performing as expected. This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of the PVWatts prediction 
calculator compared to actual real-world data obtained from the Solar Energy Research Institute (Keshena, WI). The 
results show that the PVWatts prediction of solar energy generation is statistically significantly different from the 
actual solar energy generation. Moreover, the actual solar energy generation varies year by year, and the theoretical 
vs. actual analysis demonstrates that this system is not working according to warranty expectations. Therefore, there 
is a need for a real-time monitoring system or another type of real-time preventive maintenance to know the 
performance of solar systems.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Motivation  
Like many other systems, cars have fuel economy labels to inform the potential consumer of performance-related 
expectations. Similarly, solar panels have data sheets to inform the potential consumer of performance-related 
expectations. Cars have monitoring systems (e.g., car dashboards) to notify the owner of the car’s performance. 
Unfortunately, solar energy systems do not have a monitoring system, so there is no way of knowing (in real-time) if 
the solar energy system is performing as expected. 
 
There are three current approaches to address the problem. First, solar energy system owners can do manual 
calculations based on net-metering credit from the utility company to approximate solar energy system performance 
(taking into consideration the weather over the past 30 days). Yet, this approximation will offer limited accuracy when

250","consists of solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed measurements gathered from a nearby 
meteorological station satellite. The AC power data was used to account for losses such as inverter efficiency, 
degradation, soiling, spectral effects, whereas in this study, these losses were actively calculated within PVWatts 
(Bognár et al., 2018). Similar to this study, these models were used to compare predicted data versus actual data, 
indicating that the solar panels used in the Bognár et al. study were not working at full efficiency (Bognár et al., 2018).  
 
6. Conclusion 
The purpose of this exploratory study was to test several hypotheses which ultimately are used to quantify the 
difference (if any) between the predicted (e.g., PVWatts) to actual (e.g., using real-time generation performance 
sensors) to the theoretical (e.g., using real-time temperature and solar irradiance sensors). In summary, PVWatt's 
prediction of solar energy generation is statistically significantly different from the actual solar energy generation. 
Moreover, the actual solar energy generation varies year by year. Finally, the theoretical vs. actual analysis 
demonstrates that this system is not working according to warranty expectations. For owners of solar energy systems, 
the results of this analysis are critical for (1) assessing the accuracy and decision making related to return on investment 
(via PVWatts prediction tool) and (2) evaluating real-world performance expectations (via on-site sensors, if 
available). More often than not, the “set it and forget it” approach to solar energy generation results in consumers 
*assuming* the return on investment and real-world performance is accurate when the data (as shown through this 
analysis) implies otherwise. This analysis supports the need for installing a real-time monitoring system to validate 
return on investment and warrantied real-world performance expectations. 
 
Like all studies, this study has its limitations. First, the study only assessed one solar energy system site. It is 
recommended that future research evaluate other sites which may be considerably different within the environmental 
factors and conditions that could affect certain derate factors such as soiling, snow, and shading, therefore, creating 
the potential for different results and conclusions mentioned in this study. A second limitation is that the data is 
restricted to 5 years. Due to climate change and several other external factors, future research should continue to assess 
solar energy system performance from a longitudinal perspective, utilizing as much data as possible. Third, only one 
type of technology (e.g. mono-crystalline silicon) was assessed in this study. Future research should consider the 
evaluation of new technologies including organic, premium, and thin-film technologies. Moreover, future research 
should consider different configurations (e.g., angle and orientation) and a variety of derate factors.

Abstract 
 
The primary purpose of this paper is to explain the economic logic of open science in Large-scale International Projects 
(LISPs) in fusion-energy research by applying the Mertonian norms of Communalism, Universalism, 
Disinterestedness, Originality, and Skepticism (CUDOS). LISPs in fusion-energy research provide an adhering case 
for an application of the five Mertonian norms because they are on the edge between science and technology. Thus, 
LISPs can provide a fitting example of the productive balance between the community of scientists, who favor full 
disclosure of their results, and the community of technologists, who favor secrecy or exclusive possession of their 
results, as described in the New Economics of Science. On the side of the scientists, the publicly funded International 
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, currently the largest project in fusion-energy research, is a 
fitting example of the benefits of openness in science because all the intellectual property developed in the project is 
shared equally by all its seven global members. On the side of the technologists, the next phase of fusion-energy 
research will be most likely characterized by an influx of private funding and by a shift from open science to 
proprietary technologies, which can have a possible negative impact on future research due to exclusive possession. 
The evidence drawn from a series of interviews provides support to the main research question of this paper that 
science and technology policies, which favor openness in fusion-energy research, can provide greater economic and 
social utility to both communities.

Abstract 
 
Driver impairment is yet another human factor that is likely to cause dangerous driving behavior (aka distracted 
driving), leading to safety hazards on the roads. Assuring acceptable drivers' cognitive state can improve safe driving 
performance. Behavioral and self-report measures are used to assess drivers' cognitive states, but psychophysiological 
measures can add more considerable value in the real-world driving context. Hence, monitoring, detecting, and 
responding to drivers' psychophysiological state compose a safety countermeasure that can reduce the risk of distracted

Abstract 
 
Distributed Flexible AC Transmission Systems (D-FACTS) and D-FACTS allocation are new topics that are gaining 
traction in the field of power systems. The reason for this is that they are a simple yet effective tool for improving 
power flow control, power system flexibility, and reducing overall power systems cost by manipulating some 
properties of the transmission lines on which they are installed. So far, most research has focused on improving the 
algorithms used to optimally allocate the D-FACTS along existing networks in order to maximize or minimize a 
certain objective. However, much of this research has been based on the assumption that all the parameters are pre-
defined and immutable. The key objective of this study is thus to study how the changing of different parameters may 
affect the final solutions found by the optimization algorithm. The key parameters studied are the line reactance 
adjustment limit, the number of lines on which D-FACTS are allowed, and the investment cost limit. Results show 
that all these parameters have an effect on the final solution set, and decisions need to be made by carefully weighing 
the available resources, convenience for deployment, and the potential benefits that could be brought by utilizing D-
FACTS devices.

1. Introduction  
American electric grids are facing an increasing number of issues, some of which are related to an ever-increasing 
changing climate; from the now yearly phenomenon of wildfires caused by fallen PG&E lines in California to the 
weeks-long outages in Texas in early 2021 due to freezing temperatures. While some of the issues may be weather-
related and harder to control or prepare for, many issues stem from increased demand, such as congestion and line 
overloading. Congestion is such a major issue in U.S. power grids that $40 billion were spent on congestion reduction 
projects in 2018 alone, and yet congestion costs are still measured in the billions of dollars per year (US DOE, 2020).  
In order to help mitigate this problem, we propose the use of variable-impedance series flexible AC transmission 
systems (FACTS), which help provide effective power flow control as part of smart transmission systems (Li, et al,

Overall, as described in the analysis in section 5.1, it’s very apparent that both the Cost and Global Warming Potential 
appear to go down as the investment limit increases. Although there will be a limit to how much this limit can increase 
before the objectives stop improving, this value is larger than the scope of this sensitivity analysis. 
 
Furthermore, in the LUF, while the worst and average case do slightly increase with the investment limit, the best case 
does have a downward trend, although it has very high variability which is attributed to noise, as it was found that 
none of the other factors have a significant enough effect on this variable. 
 
In addition, as reflected in figure 3, an increased number of lines in which installation of D-FACTS devices does not 
improve the overall system costs or environmental impacts. In Figure 3, the trends of the best and average cases have 
very similar slopes despite the number of lines, but the intercepts are different based on whether we look at the cases 
with 5 lines max. or with 10 lines max. In Figure 4, the effect is even more pronounced. The trend for the case with 5 
lines max appears to decrease almost quadratically as the investment limit increases (although this may be caused by 
to outliers in the data, since the regression equations do not have any significant quadratic terms), while the case with 
10 lines decreases linearly and at a much slower rate. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study performed a sensitivity analysis of the D-FACTS allocation problem taking into account three key 
parameters relevant to network properties rather than the optimization algorithm. These parameters were the amount 
of reactance change allowed on transmission lines, which affects voltage stability and total transfer along the line; the 
maximum number of lines over which D-FACTS may be installed, which affects how many lines will receive the 
devices and the feasibility of having the resources to perform the installation; and finally the monetary investment 
limit, which affects the amount of devices which will be installed throughout the system. The effects of these 
parameters are measured based on the resulting changes in the objective functions of the solutions remaining in the 
Pareto-optimal set after running the optimization algorithm, which are summarized into best-case, average-case, and 
worst-case for total expected operating costs, expected Global Warming Potential, and Line Utilization Factors, which 
correspond to economic, environmental, and sustainable effects. 
 
The sensitivity analysis was performed mainly by the use of statistical regression analysis, with a significance level 
of 5% as a standard. These calculations were assisted by the use of Minitab ® software. Statistical analysis found that 
the reactance change limit has little impact on most of the objectives and that it is not a very significant parameter in 
the optimization process. On the other hand, number of lines and investment limit have a much more significant effect, 
with number of lines having an apparent inverse relation with most objectives, while the investment limit has a direct 
relation with improving the objective function values. The main drawback, however, is that investors and decision-
makers may oppose increasing their investments despite obvious long-term benefits. Since each D-FACTS device has 
an estimated cost of $3000, and the hourly cost is calculated to be approximately 2.5 cents, an increase of $5/hr to the 
investment limit translates to approximately $600,000 in initial investment, which would discourage change and risk-
averse executives, even despite previous studies estimating hourly savings in the tens of thousands of dollars.

Abstract 
 
COVID-19 pandemic dramatically increased distributed work in academia.  Consequently, new challenges regarding 
the management of research tasks and teams have become even more pressing issues. To help researchers with this 
matter, in this paper, we share our experiences and best practices to adopt and set up an online project management 
system. This is presented as a case study of our own research group, homed in the Department of Industrial 
Engineering and Management Systems at the University of Central Florida.  Data were collected from interviews with 
key stakeholders and from observations during group meetings. The result of this research shows that the process of 
choosing and installing a project management software can be accomplished in a brief time and in an accessible 
process. Although one of the limitations of this research is that the case study was limited in two ways, specifically 
the place and type of organization, our findings are relevant to other academics aiming to improve their own 
management processes. We contribute with a framework, a set of best practices, and lessons learned for introducing a 
computer-based task management system and implementing successful managerial practices for managing distributed 
teams.

1. Introduction  
The COVID-19 pandemic expanded the demand for the work from home model, dramatically altering the work 
landscape and likely shaping the future of academic work. Together with this new moment of history, new challenges 
in managing remote research teams have taken center stage (Swain et al., 2020) with the arrival of computer-based 
project management systems available to the public. Even though many experienced researchers have long used cloud-
based tools to collect surveys, working collaboratively in documents or participating in remote meetings all the time, 
many have switched rapidly to new forms of research, involving remote qualitative interviews, or remotely conducting 
formerly lab-based psychology or usability type experiments. Issues that would be easily resolved quickly through an 
impromptu in-person conversation now require scheduling a remote meeting. Even IRBs have had to reorganize their 
processes and rules to conduct their own evaluations remotely and to evaluate the research methodologies adapted for 
the remote model to determine the impact on human subjects.  Summing up the fact that workers' motivation and 
understanding of their work in the context of an overall project can be affected by the lack of social interaction (Das 
Swain et al., 2020). Tracking the tasks of the teams became even more difficult when there also needs to be greater 
communication about what the task entails and what work needs to be done.  
 
Project management is not a required knowledge area to become a researcher, however, it is an essential day-to-day 
activity executed by these professionals.  In the face of the increased management tasks necessitated by the shift to 
more remote work, project management abilities become even more important.  For example, to improve the chances 
of project success, the researcher needs to manage efficiently the risks that it faces (Alencar et al., 2012), including 
the communication challenges.  On the other hand, the communication issues caused by the social distance have 
interfered in collaborative work, making it difficult to maintain the traditional project management activities executed 
before. The informal management that allowed tasks to remain on track is no longer available to research members no

6. Conclusion  
The use of a software project management system to support distributed work can dramatically improve chances of 
project success and reduce problems of coordination inherent in distributed work. This case study details our 
experience of rapidly adopting a new project management software suite and practices that make it useful. The 
selection and configuration of the software and developing guidance for how to use the software is dependent on the 
needs of the lab, and feedback from stakeholders must be integrated into the implementation. A software system as 
flexible as the one used in this case study, Monday.com, could prove unhelpful without clear guidelines from the lab 
director for how to use it effectively. Moreover, by following the unique contributions presented as best practices and 
lessons discussed in this document, researchers can be more assertive regarding the process to install and to use the 
tool for managerial practices. Thus, we exhort researchers and practitioners to continue exploring the use of software 
tools to manage research projects. Moving forward, we hope to explore more resources for creating dashboards and 
reports in order to facilitate the management work and improve the productivity regarding project management tasks. 
Additionally, considering that, future longitudinal studies can be conducted applied in different area of expertise, 
domains, sizes of research teams, and with greater diversity to replicate this study’s findings or to explore potential 
trends over time.

Abstract 
 
This article describes a case study with respect to the establishment of a so-called classification scheme in order to use 
it for the generation of ideas and concepts to redesign and improve an existing product. Besides, the application of 
specific TRIZ techniques is presented. These approaches are an essential part of the engineering design education 
within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology (DIT), 
Germany. The described techniques aim at providing undergraduate students with examples and guidelines for 
systematic product development and fostering and stimulating student’s creativity. It serves also as recommended 
practices for conducting engineering design projects embedded within the curriculum of their studies. The described 
procedures are based on existing design methodology and long term experience of the authors in giving respective 
design lectures and in conducting engineering projects with students and enterprises as well. The described case study 
focuses on the redesign and development of the installation process for a wall socket outlet.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Systematic Design Process 
A systematic/methodical design has a long tradition in Mechanical Engineering. The theory has been worked out and 
outlined in literature and publications (Pahl and Beitz et al. 2007, Roth 2012, VDI 1993, VDI 1997). According to the 
literature cited the design process utilizes several stages, beginning with the clarification of the task, followed by a 
conceptual design phase, an embodiment design phase and ending with detail design (Figure 1, left).

291","Figure 10. Embodiment design of version 5.2.1 
 
Figure 11 (left) shows yet another embodiment design of a concept, namely version 5.2.1, shown as an exploded view 
of a CAD-model. It consists mainly of two rotatable eccentric wheels with groove marks at one end. The eccentric 
wheels are shaped and adapted in a way so that only necessary functional surfaces remain. Each wheel is torque proof 
connected (usual hub/shaft-connection) to an axis which has a slotted head. The slot is intended for use of a screwdriver 
and indicates the position of the respective wheel. When turning the screwdriver 90 degrees the wheels expand and 
the sharp edges penetrate the inner wall of the socket box. Figure 11 (middle) shows the back view of the socket insert 
module before the installation, Figure 10 (right) shows the installed unit, whereby the metallic socket frame is hidden 
for reason of clarity. The advantages of this solution are again the simplicity regarding the design and installation. 
Only minor modifications on existing parts are necessary.   
 
 
 
Figure 11. Embodiment design of version 4.1.1 
 
A final evaluation and selection among the embodiment designs took place to reduce the number of possible solutions 
even further and to arrive at final solutions for detail design. Subsequent detailed design can lead directly into 
production. Further planning includes the manufacturing of prototype mechanisms using different materials, e.g. metal, 
plastic etc. and a step by step improvement of the components dimensions. These then will be used to verify the 
applicability and convenient handling. So far it can be stated that the achieved results were to a high degree 
acknowledged by the customer. 
 
5. Outcome and Conclusion 
By using complementary design techniques an alternative mechanism for the installation of socket outlets has been 
developed. It has been demonstrated how the selective and combined usage of several methods generates plenty of

300","solution possibilities and different states of information. As design methodologies propose a wide range of different 
techniques for use in the design process, obviously the key to a successful design is knowing when to apply each of 
these to best effect. In the present case the goal was at first to draw up a classification scheme which represents a 
formal depiction and documentation of solutions in a table and whose blank fields have been successively filled with 
novel solution concepts by systematic combination of product characteristics. These could be found by analyzing a 
similar existing product and noting its key features. The additional application of selective TRIZ-techniques to the 
concepts of the classification scheme extended the solution spectrum considerably. This approach led to promising 
and satisfying solutions which have been worked out more detailed. 
 
By conduction several engineering projects with students in cooperation with local industry partners it has been 
experienced that the quality of the final design is higher when a variety of solution concepts are developed, either for 
a whole task or also for single sub-tasks. This increases the probability of having proper variants from which the best 
can be selected afterwards. For that reason, the conduction of further comprehensible and well elaborated engineering 
design examples is desirable for training future design engineers and for pointing out the benefits of systematic 
approaches.

Abstract 
 
The study focused on the conventional yet comprehensive use of forecasting in sales prediction.  Businesses use 
forecasting to ascertain the allocation of their budgets or schedule for foreseen expenditures for a future time frame. 
In this study, forecasting is placed in the context of SG Trading which is a Filipino-owned company operating in 
Quezon City, Metro Manila.  Methodically, the study makes use of both literature and actual experiment. The review 
was employed to check the prevailing existing significant literature to summarize the results. Similarly, the experiment 
was considered because it is the most satisfactory research method when exploring quantitative data (Brownlee, 2020). 
Its main goal was to gauge the performance of the classical statistic forecasting model, namely Auto-Regressive 
Integrated Moving Average, and Autoregressive and moving average, machine learning models, Support Vector 
Machine Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor on the sales data obtained from the 
sales daily report of SG Trading. The results from the experiment revealed that XGBoost is the best suitable algorithm 
to forecast the LPG daily sales of SG Trading with the least error. In view of such findings, it is recommended to 
adopt and utilize the said forecasting model so as to have an effective planning of the LPG supply. Part of the 
limitations was the lack of variables; hence, the researchers have also suggested enhancing the sales data. In a nutshell, 
it is strongly enjoined to utilize the findings produced by various forecasting models for the improvement and 
sustainability of the business.

1. Introduction 
LPG is an essential source of modern, clean, and portable energy.  It greatly helped improve people’s lives who used 
to depend on wood and charcoal as their main source of domestic fuel.  LPG is a remarkable energy source that plays 
a big role and brought social, economic, and environmental changes worldwide. The global LPG market is anticipated 
to grow extensively due to the expansive adoption of LPG as cooking fuel by residents. Furthermore, governments 
mostly in the main consuming economies of Southeast Asia, such as China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines 
favors the initiative to endorse LPG as the alternative cooking fuel and auto fuel to replace traditional such as coal, 
wood, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel which foresee to push the demand for LPG.  Due to insufficient natural gas 
infrastructure, high energy prices, issues with energy security, and strong economic growth show a great opportunity 
for LPG in the next 10 to 20 years in the Philippines (World LPG Association, 2015).   The increasing demand and 
surge in the consumption of LPG and the profitability attached to it are the main drivers that gave businesses the urge 
to invest in the distribution of LPG in the country and resulted in the development in the competition of the LPG 
market. As LPG markets become increasingly global and with tighter levels of competition, it is most important to 
optimize the operational efficiency of organizations such as in the business of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) 
refilling.  The LPG industry must extend its resources openly and consumers must be given a wide variety of choices, 
every market advantage an industry can thought-out will matter. The essentials in the decision making of management 
action is forecasting of sales, having as vital target to predict the factors that influence their operations and trade. 
 
1.1 Objectives

303","validation is 9579.85 which is worst, and MAE is 6330.67. The performances of all the models have been discussed 
in the section where the model selection for the LPG daily sales data was made. 
 
This sales data analysis gave information on how much revenue an average customer generates during their lifetime 
with the company. This was used to predict future revenue.  With the customer lifetime value metric, the company 
can make informed decisions on how much can be spent on acquiring new customers.  The sales data also revealed 
that the number of customers decreased during the last two years.  This information was used to prepare customer 
strategic objectives and company goals in terms of customer retention, increase partner agents, and third-party 
vendors.  The forecast results further show that the company will have a reoccurring revenue and this information was 
used to plan for the internal/operational strategic objectives like innovation, product development, an improvement 
on infrastructure, and expansion. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Data analysis and forecasting support innovation, foster more appropriate and real-time decisions, and would 
subsequently lead to the improvement in organizational performance.  Sales forecasting is both a vital and pivotal part 
of the financial planning of business for any company. It serves as a self-assessment tool that uses statistics of the past 
and the current sales to predict future performance.  Sales forecasting takes part in optimizing the LPG sales process.  
Financial and sales planning along with the sales forecasts give the information needed to project the revenue as well 
as the profit. After performing the various statistical tests and performance metrics, it was found that Extreme Gradient 
Boosting Regression is a suitable algorithm in conformity with the chosen dataset and thus accomplishing the aim of

Abstract  
 
Machines can become unavailable during the planning horizon due to unexpected breakdowns. Such periods of 
unavailability should be properly taken into account when designing the production schedule. This paper proposes an 
optimal solution to unrelated parallel machine scheduling problems with availability constraints based on timed Petri 
nets (TPNs) to minimize the maximum completion time of jobs. For this NP-hard problem, a new hybrid Petri net and 
tabu search (PNTS) approach is proposed to find an optimal solution for this problem. A numerical example is used 
to assess the performance of the proposed PNTS. The computational results highlight the ability of the proposed PNTS 
to obtain optimal solutions for this problem.

1. Introduction  
Scheduling has a paramount role in production management. It dictates what will be done and chooses what resources 
that can be used (Cardon et al. 2000). The production scheduling can be challenging issue at the operational 
management level to get a schedule that maximizes the criterion. Many scheduling issues exist in modern 
manufacturing environments. There are several different types of shops in the factory, depending on job flow and the 
machine design (Moon et al. 2002). Machines, which processes orders on a job sequencing basis, can be categorized 
as a ""flow shop"". In a job shop, jobs can be done randomly on the machines in any order and there are no restrictions 
on machine order enforced. Machine scheduling is one of the most widely researched fields in the literature on 
operations, and it covers a wide range of issues (Muter 2020). The issue discussed in this paper is that independent 
jobs should be scheduled on unrelated parallel machines under availability constraint to minimize the maximum 
completion time (makespan) of jobs. There are n separate jobs, each with its own processing time, and can be processed 
on any m parallel machine that is non-identical. There are (n!)m possible schedules choices (Moon et al. 2002). 
Therefore, the scheduling problem is more difficult to be solved via dispatching rules (shortest processing time (SPT), 
longest processing time (LPT), ...etc), and these are called non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problems 
(Sethi 1977, Lenstra and Rinnooy Kan 1978). Several studies are proposed to solve unrelated parallel machine 
scheduling problems.. (Joo et al. 2012) proposed two metaheuristics, these are a GA and a new evolutionary meta-
heuristic population-based algorithm—self-evolution—to assess job allocation and unrelated parallel-machine 
scheduling for makespan minimization. The performance of the meta-heuristic algorithms are assessed using 
generated examples and the results are compared with optimal solutions. (Fleszar et al. 2012) hybridized mathematical 
programming elements with a variable neighborhood descent search approach for unrelated parallel machines 
scheduling problem for makespan minimization. (Joo et al. 2015) hybridized dispatching rules with a GA for unrelated

5. Conclusion  
This paper proposes an optimal solution to unrelated parallel machines scheduling problem subject to preventive 
maintenance to minimize the maximum completion time of jobs. To do this, a new hybrid Petri net and tabu search 
(PNTS) approach is proposed to find an optimal solution for this problem. The computational results show that the 
proposed PNTS are very effective and efficient to obtain optimal solutions. Further study should be considered for the 
assessment and implementation of some useful information in metaheuristics to evaluate how PNTS works with other 
optimization techniques. Moreover, the proposed method can be extended for the considered scheduling problem with 
limited buffer capacity constraint.

Abstract 
 
It is envisioned that future Commercial and Institutional (CI) buildings will be installed with a multitude of sensors 
that will provide water quality measures in real-time. Since water quality does not change instantly, one needs to 
predict how water quality will change over time and space, and proactively control water quality using chemical 
additives, or removing contaminants from water, to keep its quality within the regulated safe range for drinking. 
Therefore, the control systems must first develop water quality functions that can be used in predictive models and 
that can subsequently be used in a feedback control system to make optimal control decisions on additives, filtering, 
flushing, pressure and temperature adjustment, and other available control actions. This paper focuses on the 
development of these predictive models. Water flow including its physical properties (temperature, pressure, etc.), its 
chemistry (chlorine, pH levels, etc.), and its contaminants are simulated using the easily accessible water network 
modeling software EPANET. Resultant spatial-temporal water quality data from the simulation model was used to 
develop macro water quality functions using nonlinear regression and machine learning methods. The computational 
evaluation using supervised learning shows that these models can predict the water quality well.

1. Introduction 
Commercial and institutional (CI) buildings account for nearly 50% of municipal water use, whereas current water 
systems have done an inadequate job in balancing the efficient use of water with the health risks of people. Most 
people spend 8 hours or more per day in CI buildings (e.g., schools, office buildings, hospitals). Moreover, while we 
have made significant progress optimizing energy use, comfort, and security within CI buildings, we have done an

323",,"models based on data and curve-fitting of the data each with an associated R2 measure of fit. Developing expressions 
for water contents and chemistry in both surface water and ground water tanks, city pipes, and buildings’ pipes are 
currently active research among environmental engineering research. We simply assumed one of them which included 
chemical and physical properties of interest in measuring the quality of drinking water. To test the methodology 
developed, we assumed another WQF, which we referred to as WQF-B, again based on our review of literature in this 
field. 
 
A microsimulation model for a five-story water flow, using the well-accepted modeling software EPANET, was 
developed that simulated the water flow in the building with associated physical properties (temperature, flow rates, 
pressure, etc.), its chemistry (chlorine, pH levels, THM, TOC, etc.) and metal compounds contaminants. In our first 
set of experiments, we characterized water quality using WQF-A. It was clear that due to the high correlation of some 
variables in WQF-A the fitting of data using single-pass Machine Learning and/or Statistical Methods (MLSM) 
approach was unstable and highly dependent on the “seed” for starting the optimization process needed for the curve 
fitting. Hence we developed a three-phase approach where at Phase 1 we estimated the first multiplicative coefficient 
K1 of the WQF. Keeping this estimated coefficient fixed, we then estimated in Phase 2 the age of in-flow water 
characterized by (𝑡𝑡 + 𝐾𝐾7)𝐾𝐾8 . Finally, in Phase 3 we estimated the values of the other parameters in the WQF. The 
computational experiments indicated that our estimates were close to what the actual inputs were in our simulations, 
with an R2 of approximately 0.97 to 0.99. 
 
We repeated these computational experiments using input characterization WQF-B. This allowed the research team to 
conclude that the NLR method indeed is successful in estimating the WQF. Since it is envisioned that in our 
predictive feedback control system, currently being developed and tested, we need to look ahead only for short times 
(in 1-2 hours) we compared these estimation methods with a commonly used approach in machine learning, LASSO 
Regression. Computational experiments with LASSO regression are also evaluated in this paper. LASSO also 
performed quite well, fitting with R2 close to 0.97. 
 
Previewing our framework for the eventual development of a real-time predictive feedback control system for water 
in CI Buildings, our future research directions include (1) Development of acceptable water quality characterization 
which can be envisioned as a target subspace in the water quality state, defined by ranges of variables of the contents, 
physical attributes and chemistry of the drinking water, (2) Development of a predictive feedback control schemes to 
guarantee that water at the outputs in the target subspace, and (3) Evaluation of the developed predictive feedback 
control system, in simulations and through pilot testing.

Abstract  
 
The transportation and movement of waste results in extra locating time, materials, and people movement. The 
company selected produces 25 million tablets per day (9 billion annually). Their high demand results in higher 
inventory and product movement within manufacturing rooms and warehouses. The established objectives were to 
optimize the flow of warehouse production by at least 15% and increase operational efficiency also by at least 15%. 
After implementation, operational efficiency can increase by at least 35%, obtaining an investment return of 178%. 
Additionally, the objective to optimize the warehouse product flow by at least 15% after the implementations can be 
increased by at least 24%, obtaining a 3,990% return of investment. The implementations of creating a standard 
operating procedure, 5s + Visual Aids, train the personnel, maintenance of the forklift and layout analysis will take 
approximately 6 months to implement the recommended alternatives.

1. Introduction  
Due to the increase in demand for pharmaceutical products due to COVID-19 related to the Covid 19, the flow of 
materials has increased considerably. The requisitions of packaging components have been the one that has increased 
the most. It is necessary to find viable alternatives that help optimize the flow of materials and increase operational 
efficiency in the warehouse. Warehouse by improving and optimizing the layout of the materials so that the delivery 
of the components is more effective. This problem is significant they do not know how long it takes the operator to 
dispatch the packaging components to the packaging lines, and the operator must search in the five warehouses to see 
where the materials are located to start dispatching the components. The materials in the different warehouses are not 
segregated. There are mixed materials in the five warehouses within the plant. This makes it difficult to deliver 
materials when a requisition arrives. Operators must go to different warehouses to complete the delivery; several 
warehouses are far from the packing area where it is the area with the highest flow and delivery. This takes more time 
to complete the delivery than if the packaging materials were close to the area. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
The two objectives established were: optimize warehouse product flow by at least 15% and increase operational 
efficiency by at least 15%. The expected deliveries were optimized material flow to reduce costs and time, improve 
and standardize FIFO system and culture within warehouse, production rooms and shipping area. Inventory 
Management and for the current process analysis to provide process flow analysis and continuous improvement 
opportunities. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The literature review will focus on the methods of designing efficient warehouse layouts including workflow design, 
logistic network planning, order picking efficiency amongst others. Understanding how the facilities and layout

Abstract 
 
The year 2019 was a turning point for the University of Monterrey (UDEM). The most important changes were the 
strategic initiatives obtained by an international consulting firm, from which several projects were derived in different 
areas of the university. One of the most relevant academic initiatives was the introduction of Active Learning within 
the university's Pedagogical Model. In order to carry this out, it was decided to create agile teams which started 
functioning under the SCRUM framework. Following the functionality structure of this system - planning, sprints, 
refinement, review, retrospective, among others - and through various design thinking methods - crazy eights, insights, 
empathy processes - innovative ideas were generated to provide a real solution to customer needs. Through different 
experiments, user testing and empathies, as well as a clear definition of the Objective Key Results - engagement, 
collaboration and enthusiasm - Shape Your Class was developed.  In 2020, due to the pandemic, Shape Your Class 
migrated from a physical prototype to a digital technology platform. In a way, this allowed for an acceleration to online 
teacher training and enabled a greater utilization and diversification of resources that physically would not have been 
accessible. Shape Your Class is a virtual space for class design based on Active Learning that provides an authentic 
combination of functionality and innovation. Through a set of digital cards, various design options are presented, 
identifying: strategic elements, essential moments (class opening, learning tactics and class closure) and 
complementary moments (evaluation and reflection). It provides teachers with a ludic, playful and pedagogical way 
for the creative process of designing their sessions. In this way, Shape your Class was able to position itself within a 
highly innovative course design model, supported by 24 experiments, 95 courses, 119 teachers, and 969 students, 
obtaining above 80% of satisfaction rates in all Objective Key Results, as well as testimonials from both teachers and 
students. The most outstanding products that have already been delivered include the digital platform, course design 
model, user and technical manual, video tutorial, training model, communication strategy, among others. It is important 
to mention that Shape Your Class holds a patent and is registered in the Copyright National Institute in Mexico. The 
next steps for Shape Your Class include the delivery to the operational area of the Academic Development Center, 
with the objective of increasing the use of the tool to a greater volume of professors. Currently, training workshops are 
being offered and at the same time a greater diffusion of the implementation of Shape Your Class in the classroom is 
being created, always with the objective of growing academically as one of the best universities in Monterrey.

Abstract 
 
The topic of pain management systems has been around based on existing studies. However, existing systems are still 
limited, especially with the application of persuasive technology and UX/UI principles in pain management. The 
objective of this systematic review paper was to gain knowledge and provide existing parameters in developing a web-
based application for chronic pain management using persuasive technology. A total of one hundred fifty-seven (157) 
studies/papers were collected from the year 2017 and they were filtered down based on title, abstract, and full-text 
eligibility. Fifty-one (51) studies were chosen to be included in this review paper, which presented the elements and 
evaluation of UX and UI in eHealth applications, the persuasive design models and principles, and the components in 
remote chronic pain management system, in which all of them could be used as a basis in developing a web-based 
application for chronic pain management using persuasive technology. Furthermore, after basing on the presentation 
from the existing studies, this review paper also proposed a development model for the chronic pain management web 
application that also applies persuasive technology.

1. Introduction 
With how eHealth systems and applications' main goal is to influence and help its users as much as it can, its factors 
of usability when it comes to its purposes and features are vital to its successful implementation, this is especially so 
with the fact that it involves the user's health (Maramba et al. 2019). As such, any health-related application should 
be tested for its usability factors such as its user experience and user interface to ensure that the application is 
appropriately and suitably designed and tailored to its target end-users needs. It is studied and observed that there have 
been multiple publications that delve into the valuation of the user experience eHealth applications (Hajesmaeel-
Gohari et al. 2022), for the sake and goal of creating a new eHealth system, the paper seeks to explore these studies 
in order to build an optimal user experience design along with the methods for evaluation. Persuasive technology, first 
developed by B.J. Fogg (Kim et al. 2019), refers to the relationship between information and communication 
technology (ICT) and the art of persuasion (de Toledo et al. 2018). It is an area or study of human-interacting 
technology that seeks to influence or change the behavior of an individual. In relation, many eHealth interventions 
have the objective of changing behavioral habits or routines in favor of more healthy behavior (Lucero et al. 2022). 
As such, persuasive user experience designs have shown to be beneficial in web and mobile-delivered health 
interventions (Lucero et al. 2022). While applicable in multiple disciplines, the use of persuasive technology in the 
area of health is popular, as evidenced by the studies (Kim et al. 2019; Bartlett et al. 2017; Alpay et al. 2019). Pain is 
defined as the unpleasant feeling one feels due to potential or actual tissue damage. It could also be caused by other 
damages with no physical disorder (Finnerup 2019). Pain could be classified as chronic pain which is a recurring pain 
that persists for more than 3 months (Devan et al. 2019). It is a common reason for people seeking medical care, a 
leading cause of disability and one of the most widespread diseases around the world (Ghai et al. 2020; Finnerup

Abstract 
 
Blockchain technology had developed to a level where it could serve the purposes of the healthcare sector. With EHR 
as one of the deliverables of E-Health, blockchain could be utilized to address issues regarding security, privacy, and 
interoperability. This warrants the need of a proposed system to serve as a basis to future implementations. This paper 
aims to rationalize the application of blockchain to the healthcare sector and deliver a proposed system for developing 
a blockchain-based EHR system with an integrated browser-based web application that effectively facilitates the 
transmission of electronic health records between authorized healthcare organizations and manages the viewership of 
anonymized patient data. By reviewing multiple literatures which are 35 in number, with the earliest publication on 
the year 2017, this study discusses the technological evolution of healthcare, the growing distrust on electronic health 
records, the components of blockchain, and considerations on the application of multiple blockchain model types to 
the healthcare sector, to rationalize the use of blockchain to the healthcare sector. Furthermore, based on findings of 
this study, a proposed system for developing a blockchain-based EHR system with an integrated browser-based web 
application that effectively facilitates the transmission of electronic health records between authorized healthcare 
organizations and manages the viewership of anonymized patient data is proposed.

1 Introduction 
Blockchain technology is a shared, immutable ledger of all transactions across participating parties. It specializes in 
storing valuable data while ensuring its security and integrity. Thus, it makes business and organizational procedures 
of various industries more effective, legitimate, and secure. The characteristics of blockchain include immutability, 
decentralization, visibility, and traceability. Immutability can be defined as the ability of the blockchain ledger and 
the data to remain unaltered and unchanged from malicious tampering, while decentralization refers to having no 
central authority that controls the data without needing the service of a trusted third party. Meanwhile, visibility is 
where anyone in the network can view all blockchain transactions transparently, whereas traceability refers to the 
ability to trace the data with verifiable timestamps (Abu-Elezz et. al. 2020). 
 
E-health is a unique healthcare environment built on technology to automate health-related fields. One of the 
fundamental components of e-health is electronic health records (EHRs), a documentation of patients' health records. 
And since blockchain technology stores valuable data from various industries like business and intelligent contracts 
(Abu-Elezz et. al. 2020), the healthcare sectors also benefit from the technology's characteristics. The application of 
blockchain in EHRs will help address the issues of security, privacy, and interoperability of data (Mayer et al. 2019).

5 Implication and Conclusion 
This literature review basically succeeded in rationalizing the application of blockchain to the healthcare sector and 
delivering a proposed system for developing a blockchain-based EHR system with an integrated browser-based web 
application that effectively facilitates the transmission of electronic health records between authorized healthcare 
organizations and manages the viewership of anonymized patient data. 104 studies were taken from various reliable 
sources which are then filtered to 35 studies and from the filtered studies, 35 studies were selected. A growing distrust 
has been developing with regards to the data quality and privacy of electronic health records (EHRs). Blockchain may 
be the solution to these concerns. Considering the technical requirements of healthcare, a private blockchain model is 
the most effective however, when practical requirements are imposed, a consortium blockchain model serves to 
provide the benefits of a private blockchain model while eliminating the existence of a central agency. The process 
and findings in this study could be used as a reference for papers which aims to apply blockchain technology to 
healthcare. The resulting system in this study could also be used as a basis for other frameworks concerning EHR 
transmission through the propagation of transactions in a blockchain network.  
 
6 Limitation and future research 
The limitations of the study are found in the focus of the study on rationalizing the application of blockchain to the 
healthcare sector. With the growing value of data, patients who at least have partial ownership of their own medical 
data should come to benefit from the financial gains incurred in its procurement and not intermediaries which obtained 
such data through various means. In this effect, the conceptual empowerment of patient data ownership was not 
covered through the exposure of the growing distrust on EHRs which is currently in the study. This study recommends 
future researchers to extensively discuss the value of medical data and its respective beneficiaries 
 
Additionally, the study indicated a system which abstracts the intricacies of blockchain technology. Elaborations on 
such technology could become necessary for further studies. As such, the study recommends future research to provide 
a detailed layout of the various interactions between the internal and external components of a blockchain network.

Abstract 
 
Quality improvement has been widely used in healthcare in the last few decades. The US healthcare sector has made 
significant strides in quality improvement, technological advancement, and innovations in the last century, yet it is 
often referenced as a complex, expensive and an industry with many inefficient processes and systems. One of the 
widely used key performance metrics in US hospitals is the 30-day emergency department visit after a surgical 
procedure. ED visits within 30 days of a surgical procedure are considered one of the key quality outcome measures, 
adding millions of dollars each year as a cost burden to US healthcare. This study aimed to identify key predictors 
that are known prior to the patient’s surgery date contributing to undesirable ED visits within 30 days of a bariatric 
surgical procedure. The study was conducted in three phases. The first phase of the study engaged a panel of experts 
to narrow down important preoperative factors for patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the form of a Delphi study. 
The second phase of the study included quantitative data analysis, which utilized the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery 
Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Data File from 2019 to identify statistically 
significant preoperative factors that can contribute to the likelihood of patients returning to the emergency department 
within 30 days of bariatric surgery. There were N = 193,774 cases with complete information from 868 MBSAQIP-
accredited bariatric surgery centers across the United States in the Data File among which 15,533 (8% of the total 
cases) visited an ED without needing admission as inpatients. Examining the feasibility of developing a predictive 
model with only statistically significant factors and checking if the model has an acceptable fit was also part of the 
analysis. The third phase of the study reengaged the same panel of experts from the first phase to validate the findings 
from the second phase and to document the subject matter experts’ perception regarding the model developed and the 
overall findings. Out of 33 preoperative variables, only 9 variables were selected in the first phase of the study with 
the help of a panel of experts. Out of the 9 selected variables, 8 variables i.e., Pre-Op GERD requiring medication, 
Number of Hypertensive Medications, Pre-Op BMI closest to bariatric surgery, Highest Recorded Pre-Op BMI, Pre-
Op vein thrombosis requiring therapy, Pre-Op diabetes mellitus, Pre-Op history of COPD, and Pre-Op 
Steroid/Immunosuppressant Use for Chronic Condition significantly contributed to the likelihood of patients coming 
back to ED within 30 days of a bariatric procedure. The second phase of the study also yielded a predictive model 
using only the statistically significant and weighted variables, and each predictor exhibited statistical significance.

Abstract  
 
This paper examined the relationship between E-WOM and Social Media Marketing on purchase intention mediated 
by brand equity. This paper used SPSS 2.6 version to analyze 130 respondents. This paper confirms the influence of 
social media marketing on brand equity and concludes the significant impact of brand equity on e-WOM, which 
ultimately provides the answer to the question of why strong brands can persuade their consumers to spread e-WOM 
messages and influence and motivate others to buy or the same products. The main limitation in this paper is the 
sample used only Binus University students, so it is less relevant to generalize the research findings to the entire 
population of social media users. To deeply understand the role of social media marketing activities, further research 
is needed on social media users in other regions and platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

1. Introduction 
Education is a crucial matter because it can act as a future investment. Quality education can build and set a person's 
career and professionalism. Thus, it is very vital by many people, especially for those having higher education 
backgrounds. To continue their studies to the higher educational levels, people can choose between state or private 
universities. Ideally, every high school student of the class 2021 must be eager to enroll in the state universities, but 
their capacity is limited. Therefore, many of them usually decide to go to the private ones that match their criteria and 
needs. There are more private universities (PTS) than the state ones in Indonesia. Based on data from the Higher 
Education Database (PDDIKTI), there are 3,129 units of private colleges or 68% of the total universities throughout 
Indonesia in 2019. This large number triggers tighter competition and raises stronger challenges for each university 
on how to implement the most effective ways to introduce their advantages and strengths through marketing activities 
that aim to attract the prospective students’ interest (purchase intention) from the class of 2021 to continue to the 
university. Purchase Intention is a behavior that motivates people to do something (Rezvani et al., 2012). Nowadays, 
there have been many marketing strategies established by experts, but the latest trend is social media marketing. Social 
media marketing is one of the digital marketing media that also influence consumer commitment in transactions 
(Pütter, 2017). Social media marketing that is commonly used includes some platforms like Facebook, Instagram, 
YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and TikTok. Research conducted by Kim and Ko (2010) found that purchase intention 
is influenced by social media marketing. Besides social media marketing, purchase intention can also be influenced 
by E-WOM. Saba Anwar khan et al (2015) stated that E-WOM has a direct and affirmative impact on purchase 
intention. Another study conducted by Nguyen (2019) proved that overall brand equity significantly influences 
purchase intention. E-WOM positively affects brand awareness, brand association, brand loyalty, and perceived

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic situation and cancer burden trend lead the changes in the chemotherapy drugs demand. 
Chemotherapy can have several cycles of administration that take months. Moreover, delays can occur if the patient's 
physical condition is not ready to undergo the process of administration, and the data will be complete after several 
months. The availability of new patients' arrival data is faster than the demand data. The approach to integrating this 
arrival data into the economic order quantity (EOQ) model is the focus of this study. The demand rate is estimated 
using new patient arrivals data and the constant transition probabilities. Model development using infinite geometric 
series and validated by simulation using a spreadsheet. The results show the effectiveness of new patients' arrivals 
data replacing the demand data with the resulting sensitivity equivalence. Inventory decisions are sensitive when new 
patients' arrival rates are close to zero.

1. Introduction 
This study discusses the inventory policy for chemotherapy (CT) drugs using new patients' arrival rates to estimate 
the demand rate. Where the availability of arrival rate data for new patients is much faster than demand data for the 
entire administration cycle so that the inventory model can be more responsive to changes in demand in the future. 
The demand changes may occur in the long and short terms. Sung et al. (2021) estimates that the cancer burden will 
increase by 47% in 2040 compared to 2020 and be influenced by the growth and aging of the population, and it leads 
to long-term changes. The Covid-19 pandemic is one example of causing the cancer treatment demand changes in the 
short term (Drescher et al. 2022). During the pandemic, people are encouraged to stay at home, and the health care 
capacity is reduced for safety reasons. Czeisler et al. (2020) estimates that 41% of US adults delayed or avoided 
medical treatment during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
The EOQ model is used in this study to provide a basic concept of inventory policy. The simplicity and ease of 
implementation offered by the EOQ model keep this model prevalent, also in the pharmaceutical industry (Dewi et al. 
2020; Gnanasekaran and Karthikeyan 2016; Lamson et al. 1982). This study uses Doxorubicin as a CT drug for female 
breast cancer. In 2020 this cancer had the highest number of new cases reaching 2.3 million (11.7%) beat lung cancer 
cases (Sung et al. 2021). 
 
This study uses a different approach when using the arrival rates in the inventory model. Previous studies used arrival 
rates directly as demand in the inventory model (Ghosh et al. 2022; Hill and Dominey 2001; Khedlekar et al. 2014;

388","s4 still do not exist at week 13. The expected value of demand at week 13 is 815 mg. The following week has the 
same total although with a different composition. This result is the same as the formula used in Equation (4). 
 
 
 
Figure 7. The demand composition at the 13th week. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study proposes the EOQ model for CT drugs using new patients' arrival rates. The CT drug demand rate in the 
EOQ model is substituted by new patients' arrival rate and the transition probabilities between administration cycles 
using infinite geometric series. The results show arrival rate is equivalent to the demand rate, and the data on the 
arrival of new patients is faster to collect than the demand data. The demand data for complete CT cycles takes more 
than 12 weeks. Thus the proposed model can produce an inventory policy that is more responsive to changes in the 
future. A near-zero arrival rate will make inventory decisions more sensitive. The changes in arrival rate have the 
same effect on the economic lot size decisions (EOQ) changes and the total costs (TC) changes. The variability of 
chemotherapy drugs can be a consideration for further research. This variability can be a mixture of CT drugs for a 
regimen. The EOQ model is a basic model to provide basic concepts, so it needs further development to be more 
applicable in some areas, e.g., economic production quantity (EPQ) and multi-echelon supply chain.

Abstract 
 
Tight competition in the business world occurs in various fields, one of which is the culinary field, for example satay. 
Sate is a culinary that is much-loved by the public, from young people, adults to the elderly. This is an opportunity for 
satay businessmen to further develop their business. In the city of Bandar Lampung, precisely in the Bambu Kuning 
Trade Center (BTC) market area, there are very many who sell culinary satay where one of the dominant ones is Sate 
Padang Jam Gadang which is located right across from the Bambu Kuning Trade Center (BTC) market, which is one 
of the strategic locations in Bandar Lampung. This study aims to examine the effect of taste and business location on 
purchasing decisions for Sate Padang Jam Gadang and find out how the influence of taste and business location 
variables on purchasing decisions partially and simultaneously. The sample in this study were 100 respondents. By 
using Slovin's formula. The analytical tool used is multiple linear regression with the help of the IBM SPSS 25 
program. The results of this study indicate that taste and business location have a simultaneous and partial effect on 
purchasing decisions. Taste is the variable that has the most dominant influence on purchasing decisions. From the 
results of the coefficient of determination, it can be seen that the value of R square is 0.723 or 72.3%. This shows that 
the magnitude of the influence of the variable taste and business location on purchasing decisions is 72.3%. While the 
remaining 27.7% is influenced by other variables outside of this study.

 Abstract 
 
Equipment-demand of healthcare providing institutions increased drastically during the Covid-19 pandemic. While 
majority of the demand (also the most publicized) has been occurring for disposable products such as masks, gloves, 
gowns, sterilizers, and test kits; the demand for electronic devices also increased during the initial waves of the 
pandemic but dropped afterwards as it was satisfied by the manufacturers. Since devices like vital monitors, dialysis 
systems, and ventilators are not single use products, handling of such systems after acquisition has become an issue 
of operations management for healthcare professionals. Utilization of such devices seem to have a cyclic behavior 
correlated with pandemic waves (as the hospitalizations peak so the usage and vice versa) and tend to have a long-
term decreasing trend as the Covid-19 pandemic transforms to epidemic. Ventilators have found extensive usage in 
the treatment of Covid-19 related patients for ICU and emergency admissions. Medical ventilator device provides 
mechanically simulated air into the lungs of patients who are completely unable to breathe by themselves or breathes 
but insufficient to carry the necessary oxygen. So, the total functionality is crucial and service readiness is imminent.  
Number of active ventilators in Turkey increased to 22.000 units by the first year of the pandemic. However, 
utilization ratio of ventilators dropped to 29.6% (as of March 17, 2022) from the heights of 55% observed in the 
winter of 2021. Because of such decline, devices have become idle or operational times have dropped significantly. 
Health institution under investigation is a full-service government hospital operating in the city of Istanbul, Turkey. 
There are currently 142 ventilators in the hospital with less than 35% utilization. Maintenance task is only carried 
out by manufacturer approved service providers and parts are supplied from abroad. Since the operator of devices is 
a non-profit government hospital, maintenance outsourcing is done by bidding with strict budget and usually under 
the pressure of currency exchange rates even after the maintenance contract is signed. Failure analyses indicate 
mean time to failure of devices has not changed significantly with respect to pre-pandemic operation. Periodic 
maintenance strategy that has long been adopted for such devices has been modified to consider cyclic operation, 
extended standby durations, and lead time of spare parts. Further proposals are under consideration for group 
maintenance involving multiple healthcare institutions.

Abstract 
 
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are considered the leading cause of occupational disability and loss of productivity. 
The manufacturing industry is one of the work sectors where workers are most exposed to risk factors that can cause 
MSDs. This article reports the case of workers in a manufacturing company located in Tijuana, Mexico. This research 
aims to minimize the ergonomic risk workers are exposed to in the mechanical kick press and packaging stations. 
Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) and Job Strain Index (JSI) methods are applied to evaluate the risk levels 
caused by postural load and repetitive movements before and after redesigning the stations. To redesign the stations, 
an anthropometric study was performed on the workers. The results show that, with the design of the new press station, 
the level of risk caused by the postural load is reduced from 10 (high) to 1 (negligible), while the level of risk caused 
by repetitive movements is reduced from 13.5 (high) to 1 (low). In the case of the packaging station, the level of risk 
caused by postural load was reduced from 9 to 2, while the level of risk caused by repetitive movements remained at 
3. It can be concluded that the correct application of different Ergonomics tools allows for eliminating several risk 
factors.

1. Introduction 
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are considered the leading cause of work disability, sick leave, and lost 
productivity (Bevan 2015). Several studies show that the manufacturing industry is one of the work sectors where 
workers are most exposed to risk factors that can cause MSDs. For example, Hembecker et al. (2017) indicate that 
workers in the manufacturing industry in Brazil suffer from MSDs in shoulders, elbows, forearms, hands and wrists, 
which negatively impacts workers' health. In other similar research, Ayub and Shah (2018) conducted a cross-sectional 
study with 48 manufacturing workers aged 18 to 45 years and reported that 79% of the participants had experienced

403","5.6 Results of stage 6 
Figure 6 shows two people working at the redesigned semi-automatic press and packing stations. After re-evaluating 
the level of risk caused by postural loading and repetitive movements at these stations, scores of 1 and 2 were obtained 
with the REBA method, while scores of 1 and 3 were obtained with the JSI method for the semi-automatic press 
station and the packing station, respectively. In all cases, the risk level was low, so the tasks were safe for the workers. 
 
6. Conclusions 
In this research, two workstations were evaluated from an ergonomic approach to detect and eliminate risk factors that 
could favor the appearance of MSDS in workers. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that the objective 
initially set out in this research has been achieved since the risk levels were reduced from high to low, reducing 
workers' exposure to factors that favor the development of MSDS. 
 
In general, this research concludes that even today, workers in the manufacturing industry in Mexico are exposed to 
risk factors that favor the development of MSDs. For this reason, it is recommended that further research be carried 
out in companies in this sector. In addition, this research validates that the REBA and JSI methods are easy to apply 
and allow the detection of risk factors and opportunities for improvement in the design of workstations to eliminate 
exposure to these factors. Due to this, and based on the results obtained in this research, it is recommended that the 
company apply these methods to evaluate the levels of risk caused by postures and repetitive movements in other work 
areas. Finally, it is concluded that the anthropometric design of workstations is a practical and efficient tool to 
eliminate or reduce the level of risk caused by the postural load. Therefore, it is recommended to companies, 
specifically managers, supervisors, and health and safety department personnel, to go deeper into the anthropometric 
design, know the other variables, the application process, and its advantages and disadvantages.

Abstract  
 
Tourism is part of the source of state income that contributes greatly and has a significant effect on improving the 
economy of a country. The more tourists who come to a country, the higher the transactions related to tourism, such 
as airlines, hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues and so on. Muslims are the second largest number in the world 
who have halal standards for each of their activities, including halal tourism activities. Halal tourism is a subset of 
tourism provided to Muslim families based on Islamic rules for example Hotels in such destinations do not serve 
alcohol and have separate swimming pools and spa facilities for men and women. Problems arise when a Muslim 
family travels to a country but gets conditions that are not halal or contrary to Islamic rules so that it disturbs the 
comfort of Muslim tourists. Block chain technology offers a solution for halal tourism by validating every component 
that is part of halal tourism. The purpose of this research is to help countries and Muslims organize halal tourism using

Abstract  
 
The number of victims of the COVID-19 virus that continues to increase requires effective prevention efforts. One of 
the factors that can reduce the number of victims of the COVID-19 virus is vaccination for citizens, which is supported 
by an even distribution of vaccines to all regions in Indonesia. But currently the distribution process is experiencing 
problems due to abuse of authority by vaccine distributors and the uneven distribution of vaccines. This problem arises 
because there is no system that can monitor the distribution of vaccines comprehensively which covers all the 
weaknesses mentioned above. Meanwhile, blockchain is a system that provides a high level of security that can protect 
transactions in it. The purpose of this research is to help the government build a system that monitors the distribution 
of vaccines as planned. The result of this research is a model for controlling the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine 
using block chain technology. The research method uses a qualitative approach through observation and literature 
review to identify problems and alternative solutions.

Abstract  
 
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has an impact not only on health, but also on social and economic 
conditions. The government seeks to reduce the burden of household expenditures through the expansion of the basic 
food program participation and cash assistance, especially to meet food needs and improve community nutrition. 
However, many village heads and village officials corrupt the social assistance, so that welfare is not enjoyed by the 
village community but only enjoyed by the village head or other officials. Blockchain technology is a technology that 
offers a high level of transparency and security with several built-in features. The purpose of this research is to help 
the government oversee the provision of social assistance so that the stones can be distributed according to their 
designation. The research method uses a qualitative approach to find problems and alternative solutions using an 
information technology approach. The result of this research is a monitoring system model for social assistance using 
blockchain technology.

Abstract  
 
One of the government's functions for society is to provide services for administrative needs for business licensing, 
citizens' rights to education, health, welfare and other citizens' rights. The number of services that must be provided 
by the government to society where these services are increasingly complex requires the government through its staff 
to provide the best service. The ability of the government to provide the best service must be accompanied by high 
knowledge of government staff while currently the government service and knowledge of government staff have not 
been integrated so that it hampers government services to the community. The purpose of this research is to help the 
government improve the quality of services for society by integrating knowledge management systems with e-
government. The result of this research is the integration model between e-government and KMS. The research method 
uses a qualitative approach through observation and literature review to identify problems. Literature review is also 
used to find alternative solutions with information technology.

Abstract 
 
To make a cost-efficient and reliable lot disposition, various acceptance sampling strategies were developed for 
different perspectives in recent years. In this article, we propose a new method involving a flexible operating 
mechanism of decision rules, and the quality characteristic of interest of the inspected product considers multiple 
dimensions. The plan parameters, critical values and required sample size of the proposed method are obtained by 
solving a constructed optimization model, which minimizes the required average sample number (ASN) and 
constrains two non-linear equations under desirable quality levels of submission and tolerable sampling risks 
simultaneously. Both ASN and operating characteristic (OC) functions of the proposed method are derived based on 
the Markov chain technique. To examine the performance of the proposed method, several analyses are conducted 
and also compared with existing methods under the same conditions. The results indicated that the proposed method 
(i) has a better discriminatory power with equal sample consumption, (ii) requires a smaller ASN for inspection 
under the same conditions, (iii) provides a flexible operating procedure, which may avoid the disruption between the 
vendors and buyers. Thus, the proposed method provides a more efficient and reliable lot sentencing scheme for 
products with multiple quality characteristics. In addition, an example taken from the real-world application is 
illustrated to show the practicability of the proposed method.

Abstract 
 
The case study entitled “Social Engineering Attack Awareness and Prevention Training” is focused on improving the 
security for a diving business. In recognizing the importance of tourism to the economy of the Philippines, the business 
was chosen with the goal of proposing an information security plan to help the business better their current state of 
security. The proponents of the study conducted an online interview with a representative of the company for the main 
purpose of acquiring information regarding the nature of the business and their current information security system. 
In this study, it was determined that the business greatly lacked the appropriate security measures and knowledge 
when it came to social engineering threats. Thus, it was decided that a social engineering security training program 
was the optimal route in improving the overall security of the company. After gathering information from various 
professional organizations, individuals, and websites on the Internet, the training program – sharing the same name as 
the case study – was designed to take place over the course of three days. In those three days, the training program 
introduces what social engineering attacks are, how to identify and prevent them, and how to develop a business 
recovery and continuity plan. Through this, the company should be knowledgeable and prepared for threat actors 
seeking to harm the business with the use of social engineering attacks.

Abstract  
 
A pediatric stander is an adapted piece of equipment whose function is to achieve the vertical position of the child 
when motor control is inadequate, in other words, when the child cannot stand and control his weight against gravity, 
having the age to do it. This technical equipment is necessary for patients diagnosed with cerebral palsy who have 
already acquired head control and initiated trunk control. This product has a high value in Peru. For the generation of 
this equipment, we will apply a computer editing and design process, we will follow a 5-step process in addition to 
applying CAD, CAE, and CAM techniques, emphasizing the design optimization method. Finally, we will verify how 
the application of this methodology, together with computer simulation, allows us to generate a functional, resistant 
prototype and, in the main point, with optimization in design and acquisition costs.

1. Introduction  
Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as a disability that affects the movement and posture of the body. It is a disorder that 
consists of a set of permanent disorders that affect various areas of the body, which limits the activity of the body and 
are produced by non-progressive lesions that occurred while the central nervous system was developing. Likewise, 
this disorder can present alterations such as sensitivity, behavior, communication, cognition, perception, and 
psychological problems.(Garita Meneses et al., 2020; Occhipintti & Mendoza, 2018; Vila Paucarcaja et al., 2016) In 
addition, it can be classified into three types depending on the area of the brain that is affected, which are: spastic 
paralysis, ataxic paralysis, and athetoid paralysis. 
 
In Peru, a study conducted at the Cayetano Heredia National Hospital in 1993 showed that the incidence of CP in live 
newborns had a prevalence of 5.2 per 1,000, but currently, the frequency of children with CP has increased due to 
increased survival of outpatient preterm infants and to decreased infant mortality.(Vila Paucarcaja et al., 2016). Among 
the various applicable treatments to seek an improvement in muscles and positioning, techniques known as a pediatric 
stander, orthoses, or adapted equipment are used to achieve the vertical position. 
 
This article is focused on the pediatric stander, oriented to the Peruvian reality, where the different cultural, social, 
and economic characteristics show that a large part of the minority of the population, such as patients with cerebral 
palsy, and even worse, children with this disability do not have the necessary means to acquire adequate treatment. 
To solve the described problem, this scientific research is focused on the use of the design optimization method to be 
able to produce a pediatric stander, seeking to satisfy the needs raised. All this with the help of computer-aided design 
(CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programs.(N. Cobetto et al., 
2016; Nikita Cobetto et al., 2017; Frizziero et al., 2021; Guy et al., 2021; Heo et al., 2021; John Ignacio et al., 2019; 
Lopez et al., 2020; Matuda et al., 2021; Naddeo et al., 2018; Sosa-Méndez, 2016; Wang et al., 2016) The scientific 
articles reviewed on this methodology give us good information to be able to use it in the best way to satisfy the stated 
need.

of this coefficient in a color scale. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Safety factor 
 
As can be seen in the figure, the safety coefficient has a minimum value of 8.83 and a maximum value of 15, which 
are within the color scale between blue and light blue that express optimal results. This means that the safety of the 
equipment can drop to 8.83 with the application of the applied forces that simulate the weight of the child, but even 
so it is within a value far from 0 and close to 15. In other words, it can be said that the equipment is safe for use, which 
is the most important requirement for the creation of the pediatric stander. 
 
6. Conclusion  
After what was presented through the design optimization methodology used in this work compared to the real models 
in the market, it was achieved that, in the first place, the cost/benefit ratio proves to be more than optimal with a 
percentage of 92.77 of savings for the user or organization that is interested in acquiring a pediatric stander concerning 
the local reality. Secondly, the implementation of specialized software, such as Autodesk Inventor Professional and 
Aspire, demonstrated a great facility for effective and efficient execution of objectives to be met, allowing direct 
results to be obtained for the allowable stress limit for the material (from 0 at 7.92 MPa) and the safety coefficient 
(Min. of 8.83), the latter being the indicator that gives way to its manufacture. 
 
On the other hand, knowing that in the local reality it is not so easy to acquire the cutting services of a CNC machinery, 
it was considered that it is possible to choose to carry out the same method until the CAE phase, wherewith the help 
of the plans obtained in the CAD cuts and fabrication can be made with a manual jigsaw. Although precise results 
such as those provided by the CNC machine are not achieved, the final objective is achieved.

Supply chain simulation has been used to analyze possible scenarios, and one of the most used techniques is system 
dynamics, and although there are some literature reviews on this topic, the number of papers has increased in recent 
years, so it is necessary to analyze trends, locate the most relevant research groups, authors, and papers. This article 
reports a bibliometric review on the dynamic system applied to the supply chain on engineering and analyzes 519 
documents found in the Scopus and Web of Science databases using PRISMA methodology and VosViewer software. 
Findings indicate that China, the United States of America and the United Kingdom are the countries that produce the 
most papers, although Cardiff University is the institution with the most consolidated research groups. The most 
productive authors are Towill, D.R., Naim, M.M. and Rabelo, L., although the most cited are Towill, D.R., Naim,

1. Introduction 
A supply chain (SC) is a set of processes involved and aimed to customer satisfaction that is consuming goods or 
services, integrating suppliers in the raw materials procurement, the manufacturer who transforms them into finished 
or intermediate products, distributors who bring them to the place where they are required, and consumers in the final 
stage  (Agarwal, Shankar, & Tiwari, 2007). The integration of all these actors in the supply chain makes it dynamic, 
not static and reacts to parties' actions, and it is an open system (Abdullah, Hishamuddin, & Bazin, 2019). In this

Abstract 
 
Dominant service orientation is a portfolio base owned by business actors where they are superior to their competitors. 
The ability of organizations to offer superior service and produce a more valuable customer experience is vital in 
achieving a competitive advantage. Business actors must be able to transform all valuable, unique, inimitable, 
organized resources and capabilities during today's changing environment to facilitate the consumer experience. One 
of the essential perspectives of Resource-Based Theory is how organizations achieve and elevate superior performance 
in the markets. They operate through the business's internal resources and capabilities, such as the existence of a 
dominant service orientation that is strong, providing direction and purpose towards building quality marketing 
capabilities through a combination of responsive market orientation and firm-specific innovation ecosystem as 
strengthening of ambidexterity SME business in Bali, Kalimantan, and Sumatra.

1. Introduction  
Environmental awareness has increased recently (Papadas et al. 2017, Wales et al. 2019, Zameer et al. 2022). The 
business world has realized the need to protect the natural environment, operationalize and increasingly integrate green 
and socially conscious marketing activities into daily business practices. With all their financial, managerial, and 
intellectual resources, SMEs must find new ways to maintain and improve their products and services. New demands 
for new products and services are constantly emerging, requiring them to make new adjustments, especially to 
environmental issues. Suppose the company is considered successful in carrying out operational activities oriented 
towards environmental health, consumer health, and social health. In that case, it will build organizational expertise 
and skills in carrying out operational tasks such as using and allocating organizational resources, adapting to market 
changes and unspecified consumer needs. Predictability improves and develops the organization concerning its 
practices, activities, and production to become aware that it appears superior to other competitors (Kimbrough, 2011). 
Concerning businesses pursuing competitive advantage must be able to translate complex environments into their 
routine marketing activities because innovation ensures competitive advantage and ecological benefits, and consumer 
and social welfare. Organizations with solid environmental awareness marketing ecosystems tend to have unique 
process signatures imitated uneasily by competitors, a source of sustainable competitive advantage that enables 
organizations to generate superior returns. Recently research found that SMEs need several factors to support selling 
their goods using innovation marketplace (Inayatullah. et al. 2021).

Hypothesis 1 states that the path coefficient value is positive at 0.761, and the t-statistic value is 9.839. Because the 
t_statistic value is 9.839> t_table 1.96 or it can see the p-value <0.05 so that the Service-Dominant Orientation has a 
significant effect on the Responsive Market Orientation. These results reveal that the conceptualization of a business 
mindset derived through business services can shape and influence business decisions that lead to market needs that 
encourage positive interactions with consumers to respond to and answer all market needs (Vargo & Lusch, 2016). 
Hypothesis 2 states that the positive path coefficient value is 0.279 and the t-statistic value is 1.290 <t_table 1.96, or 
P-value > 0.05. it means Service-Dominant Orientation does not significantly affect Firm-Specific Innovation.  
Hypothesis 3 found the path coefficient value with a positive sign of 0.548 and the t-statistic value of 2.561. Because 
the t_statistic value is 2.561> t_table 1.96 or P-value < 0.05. It means the Responsive Market Orientation has a 
significant effect on Firm-Specific Innovation.  
Hypothesis 4 states that the path coefficient value with a positive sign was 0.904, and the t-statistic value was 2.859. 
Because the t_statistic value is 2.859> t_table 1.96, or p-value <0.05 so, Firm-Specific Innovation has a significant 
effect on Exploitative Operational Ambidexterity. 
Hypothesis 5 found that the path coefficient value with a positive sign was 0.159 and the t-statistic value was 0.624 
because the value of t_statistic is 0.624 <t_table 1.96, or p-value is > 0.05, so the Responsive Market Orientation does 
not significantly affect the Exploitative Operational Ambidexterity.  
Hypothesis 6 found that the path coefficient value with a negative sign was -0.225. The t-statistic value was 0.950 
because the t_statistic value is 0.950 < t_table 1.96, or it expresses that the p-value > 0.05 so that the Service-Dominant 
Orientation does not significantly affect the Exploitative Operational Ambidexterity. 
Hypothesis 7, fortunately, can support the model. The calculation statistic results in a value of 2.268> t_table 1.96, or 
the p-value <0.05, so Firm-Specific Innovation does not act as a mediator of Responsive Market Orientation to 
Exploitative Operational Ambidexterity.  
Hypothesis 8 is accepted. The calculation results the t_statistic value is 2.291> t_table 1.96, or the p-value <0.05, so 
that the Responsive Market Orientation and Firm-specific Innovation Ecosystem acts as a mediator of Service-
Dominant Orientation against Exploitative Operational Ambidexterity. 
 Hypothesis 9 cannot support the model. The calculation results are that the t_statistic value is 1.339 <t_table 1.96, or 
the p-value is >0.05, so Firm-Specific Innovation does not act as a mediator of Service-Dominant Orientation to 
Exploitative Operational Ambidexterity.  
Hypothesis 10, unfortunately, cannot support the model. Calculation results are that the t_statistic value is 0.596 
<t_table 1.96, or the p-value is >0.05 so that the Responsive Market Orientation does not act as a mediator of Service-
Dominant Orientation to Exploitative Operational Ambidexterity. Hypothesis 11 is accepted. The calculation results 
are that the t_statistic value is 2.694> t_table 1.96, or the p-value <0.05, so that the Responsive Market Orientation 
acts as a mediator of Service-Dominant Orientation towards Firm-Specific Innovation.  
 
The research findings show that the conceptualization of the combination of innovation and responsiveness 
strengthens ambidexterity, passed down through SME business services. This Orientation will mobilize all business 
resources and capabilities, which will play a role in shaping and increasing ambidexterity consisting of organizational, 
social, and human resources. Therefore, especially for the SME sector in Bali, Kalimantan, and Sumatra, it is 
significant to consistently build and strive for uniqueness throughout the business life through firm-specific 
innovations supported by the market response, which is called integrated interaction in entrepreneurial autonomy. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The development of the right products/services helps a business to succeed—market orientation fosters ambidexterity 
in operations to explore & exploit capability. Responsive market orientation is related to adaptive learning, leading to 
exploitation and exploration. Concerning market orientation with innovations stated that market orientation influences 
the ability to innovate by recognizing customers to improve efficiency and increase revenues. Market orientation is 
vital for success in operations, but other strategic resource capabilities should complement it. 
 
The most critical strategic resource capabilities to create and maintain ambidexterity. Through firm-specific 
innovation, ambidexterity proved to classify as organizational, social, and human capital resources. That will be a

Abstract  
 
The competitiveness of national infrastructure is influenced by the strength of the precast concrete industry, leading 
to the need for its productivity to be boosted. Although many interminable challenges have been unfolding, the 
domestic precast concrete companies are presently attempting to penetrate the foreign markets through thorough 
preparation, specifically in organizational competitiveness. This is due to their potential competition with a wider 
market, compared to the domestic. The number of foreign construction companies, specifically precast concrete 
services, also continues to grow in the Indonesian domestic market and largely occupy business fields, due to the low 
competitiveness of local organizations, which has been identified as a future potential threat. Therefore, this study 
aims to analyze the competitiveness of local companies in the Indonesian domestic market. This needs to be highly 
evaluated as well as importantly and carefully planned to avoid low organizational competitive levels. A qualitative 
method was used with SWOT analysis and neural network mapping, which were supported by previous literature. The 
results show that precast products and marketing strategies should be able to have long-term planning in achieving 
market size, for the minimization of external threats.

1. Introduction  
Precast concrete is a new innovation widely used in construction processes, such as buildings and bridges, due to its 
ability to speed up processing time, save costs, and minimize waste for formwork and scaffolding (Reichenbach and 
Kromoser 2021). This innovation is one of the construction systems in accordance with the Industry 4.0 concept. The 
precast system is listed in SNI 03-2847-2002 (Badan Standardisasi Nasional 2002), with the procedure for calculating 
concrete structures based on ACI 318-99 (Cagley et al. 1999). The development of Indonesian facilities and 
infrastructures, which is still in progress, has been consuming enormous investments, therefore, organizational 
competitiveness is highly needed for successful management (Stoyanova and Angelova 2018). This is because the 
country's 4.73% economic growth is still far from expectations as of September 2015, with a minimum of 7% level 
being needed for the achievement of a developed nation in 2025. When the infrastructural situation of a country is 
weak, the economy is observed to be inefficiently operated (McBride et al. 2003). In this condition, higher costs are 
considered to cause inadequate competitiveness among numerous companies and businesses (Arai 2022). The 
infrastructural provision within the country is also observed to be slow, due to the occurrence of challenges at various 
stages of the project, from preparation to implementation. Some physical examples of these infrastructures include

Abstract 
 
Cigarette products in Indonesia have developed from conventional cigarettes, cigars, and shisha to electric cigarettes 
or commonly known as vapes. Indonesia ranks as the country with the third-largest number of smokers globally, even 
though people know that the consumption of tobacco products can cause harm to their bodies. Warning labels are 
printed on each pack of conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes with sentences such as ""smoking can damage health"" 
(or similar meaning sentences) and pictures ranging from damaged human lungs, and perforated throat to pictures of 
fallen teeth. This behavioral phenomenon becomes interesting for further study. This research aims to analyze the 
influence of product development and health consciousness on purchase intention and its impact on the purchase 
decision of e-cigarettes in Tangerang City, Indonesia. This study is a quantitative research using a non-probability 
approach with purposive sampling. The number of populations in this study is 1,378,860, with a minimum sample of 
385 respondents. Data were collected by distributing online questionnaires to smokers and non-smokers above 18 
years old in Tangerang and then analyzed using SPSS. The results showed that product development has a positive 
significant impact on purchase intention and purchase decision, and purchase intention has a significant effect on 
purchase decisions, while other variables have a negative significant impact on each other.

5.4 Proposed Improvements  
Based on the test results in this study, it can be concluded that health awareness does not affect people's interest in 
buying e-cigarettes because they already have the common awareness that cigarettes are dangerous and could affect 
human health and lifestyle. It all comes back to the risk taken by the individual to keep smoking or not. Meanwhile, 
if there is product development in the industry, the public can consider it as a supporting factor to keep buying e-
cigarettes. 
 
 
6. Conclusions 
In this study, primary source data was collected and processed with SPSS using validation test, reliability test, 
normality test, heteroscedasticity test, autocorrelation, the goodness of fit, and hypothesis tests. Through these tests, 
the results showed that health consciousness has a negative significant impact on purchase intention, while product 
development has a positive significant impact on purchase intention. Health consciousness also has a negative 
significant impact on purchase decisions, while product development has a positive significant impact on purchase 
decisions. Another result is that purchase intention has a significant effect on purchase decisions. Indirectly, health 
consciousness and product development each have a negative significant impact on purchase decisions through 
purchase intention.

Abstract 
 
Industry 4.0 has started to radically disrupt the business environment and is likely to expand worldwide in the coming 
decades. This transformation has an impact not only on production processes, but also on the structure of work. The 
human factor has been one of the topics focused on in this paradigm, due to the volatility of role profiles that is closely 
linked to skills challenges. The main objective of this paper is to display the conceptualization of a technological tool 
capable of enabling greater ease and agility in the management of human resource competencies, while promoting an 
increase in workforce engagement. The study followed the triangulation methods methodology, where three sources 
of information were crossed: HRM documents (from consulting firms), scientific articles, and a focus group with 
experts in the areas of HR management and information systems, from academia and industry. Through this, it was 
possible to create a set of requirements for the tool that preserves what companies already have, i.e. the Lean 
philosophy. To this end, a competence matrix is digitally incorporated, transporting Lean to a higher level of 
excellence. In addition to the concept display, some interfaces of a low fidelity prototype are presented to facilitate 
the interpretation of the requirements. Hence, this tool promises a more agile management of competencies, with the 
possibility of future career prospects for the employee (through the comparison of what is required in other functions). 
In addition, it will provide the manager with a more agile allocation of people (through talent reviews) to functions, 
reducing labor turnover.

1. Introduction 
Price and customization have always been two important pillars for the market. Nowadays the customer wants specific 
products, with high customization, which culminates with short lifecycles (Nagy et al., 2018). The new industrial 
paradigm, known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0), launches the incorporation of digital technologies into the manufacturing 
process to improve productivity and efficiency (Leesakul et al., 2022). This digital transformation can potentiate 
benefits for the industry in terms of customized products in short time intervals (Silva et al., 2021), thus bringing 
together the ability to personalize products with the characteristics of mass production (Wang et al., 2017). But all 
paradigm shifts bring challenges and sometimes barriers and trade-offs. Vuksanović Herceg et al. (2020) points out 
as one of the main barriers is the lack of competencies that affect the organizations that want to migrate to the industry 
4.0 paradigm. Also, Manda & Ben Dhaou (2019) refers to four potential challenges associated with this new paradigm: 
(i) potential job losses, meanwhile repetitive tasks could be performed by robots, even if in collaboration with humans; 
(ii) skills challenges, since the technology requires new capacities, both in programming and in the manipulation and 
analysis of the data generated; (iii) infrastructure challenges, closely related to the integration of components at the

Abstract  
 
Employees in the public sector should be service-oriented rather than profit-driven. They should be motivated by the 
inherent advantages and rewards of their job. Therefore, the study proposes to use the Rasch Model Analysis to 
examine the well-being of public knowledge workers based on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. 
According to the findings, public knowledge workers who are more satisfied with their jobs have higher affective 
commitment than those who are less satisfied. Furthermore, those who are more satisfied with their jobs have a higher 
level of normative commitment. Furthermore, dissatisfied public knowledge workers tend to have higher continuance 
commitment than satisfied ones. The findings indicate that, despite their dissatisfaction with the promotion system in 
public learning institutions, the public knowledge workers continue to perform their duties as civil servants. It is 
exemplified by a high level of normative commitment, a type of state-mandated faithfulness to public organizations.

1. Introduction  
New public management theory significantly transformed the culture of the public sector in the 1990s by adopting 
some of the principles of private management, with an increasing emphasis on cost efficiency, managerial 
entrepreneurialism, results-focused management, and the empowerment of public sector consumers (Baptista et al., 
2020). Moreover, in today's globally competitive environment, providing outstanding service is viewed as a crucial 
strategy for success and survival. Therefore, service quality and efficiency are becoming increasingly critical in the 
public sector. 
 
Government services and quality standards are evolving in response to customer needs and expectations (Ramseook-
Munhurrun et al., 2010). Furthermore, public organizations have recognized that providing high-quality service results 
in long-term sustainability and competitive advantage (Serafim & Veríssimo, 2021; Sung & Kim, 2021). As a result, 
organizations in the public sector are under growing pressure to enhance the quality and efficiency of their services. 
However, when it comes to government services and the quality standards that go with them, customers' needs and 
expectations change (Ramseook-Munhurrun et al., 2010).  
 
Employees in the public sector should be service-oriented rather than profit-oriented. They should be genuinely 
invested in their work (Rafsanjani et al., 2019; Valor-Segura et al., 2020). A public sector employee is defined as 
responding to both broad and institution-specific reasons. It includes the following: (1) an involvement in public policy 
closely linked to the pursuit of success and inner/personal fulfillment; (2) a commitment to the common good and 
civic responsibility. This second component is integrally linked to the desire or ability to promote the public good and 
(3) empathic or compassionate feelings characterized by a desire to help others. Employees who are patient when 
assisting the group exemplify this characteristic. Finally, (4) self-sacrifice is a concept related to the attitude of loving 
one's country (patriotism), being accountable for one's responsibilities, and remaining loyal to one's country. 
Employees in the public sector should be service-oriented, not profit-driven, and really involved. They should be 
motivated by the inherent benefits and rewards of their employment (Abidin et al., 2020; Rafsanjani et al., 2019; 
Valor-Segura et al., 2020)

According to the findings, the public learning institution should have a specific method for developing organization 
members. Based on the research findings, the outcomes of the team-building development process have been 
successfully demonstrated. Rasch Model analysis proves that public knowledge workers have a strong sense of 
teamwork. In contrast, the promotion system has the least satisfaction. The findings show that public knowledge 
workers think that their duties do not guarantee a career rank after they complete it. Therefore, the promotion system 
needs to be renewed. In addition, the achievement factor should be added to the promotion system to give extra value 
to the high achiever in their duty. The achievement factor can be classified into high achievers, medium achievers, 
and low achievers. High achievers will be motivated because they will know that their contribution can be an additional 
point for their next rank promotion. 
 
The findings also prove that some public knowledge workers are dissatisfied with the promotion system in public 
learning institutions. They continue to perform their duties as civil servants. It is demonstrated by the high level of 
normative commitment, despite the lower level of affective commitment. Normative commitment is a type of state-
mandated faithful commitment to public organizations. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Employee well-being is influenced by the pleasure or displeasure gained from the job and individuals' interactions 
with colleagues, teammates, and supervisors. Employee well-being can be measured in positive outcomes such as job 
satisfaction and organizational commitment. 
 
The Rasch model describes job satisfaction among public knowledge workers at a public sector learning institution. 
According to the Wright Map, 48 percent of public knowledge workers are satisfied with their job assignments. In 
contrast, they have a high organizational commitment (51 percent). 
 
The Rasch Model also shows public sector learning institutions are most satisfied with their coworkers. It implies that 
they have a strong sense of teamwork. Meanwhile, The Rasch Model also shows public knowledge workers have high 
normative commitment. The findings imply that they are committed to the common good and civic responsibility. It 
also has to do with having a patriotic mindset. Being responsible for one's duties, and keeping loyal to one's country 
since should be customer-focused rather than profit-driven. 
 
The Rasch Model results validate the first hypotheses that there is a significant difference in affective commitment 
based on public knowledge of workers' job satisfaction. The second hypothesis is a significant difference in normative 
commitment based on public knowledge of workers' job satisfaction. In contrast, in the third hypothesis there is a 
significant difference in continuance commitment based on public knowledge workers' job satisfaction is statistically 
rejected. 
 
There are still some limitations to this study. It would be preferable to rearrange the research instruments with more 
items to measure each job satisfaction dimension and organizational commitment dimension for future research. It is 
also preferable to add more respondents from various public service sectors or other industries. It might be also 
interesting to have a comparative study between private and public knowledge workers.

Abstract  
 
This study has successfully created a virtual reality training environment for wheelchair users aimed to serve children 
with severe cerebral palsy and cognitive impairments. The proposed system integrates motion tracking with virtual 
reality technologies in real time for rehabilitation purposes. The system aims at improving the trainee motor functions 
allowing the caregivers to directly interact with the child using visual cues. The live motion trajectory recorded from 
caregivers could provide a strong interaction with patients to enhance their engagement, comfort, and enjoyment of 
training. The proposed system can potentially help improve the lives of dozens of children who suffer from the effects 
of cerebral palsy in a safe, cost-effective, and entertaining environment. 
 
Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of most common diagnosed childhood motor function disabilities in United States. It affects 
a person’s movement and coordination of muscles to maintain balance. Though many treatments do exist on the 
market, they can be expensive and time-consuming activities which are often beyond the means of many families. 
There is often the problem of limited space available for practicing the control of assistive devices in a safe manner. 
Virtual reality (VR) technology has gained attentions as an intervention to improve motor function for the children 
with CP. It can provide end-users the feel that they are engaged with their surroundings with far more realistic 
conditions than a training program which involves only screen-based action. Meanwhile, the level of task difficulty 
can be easily modified to effectively improve their motor function, based on the real-time feedback from task 
performance. In 2022, the report from Birth Injury Help Center indicated that a large percentage of children with CP 
have some level of hearing impairment. It directly leads to their speech and language problems, which greatly results 
in their difficulties to follow instructions and may result in training ineffectiveness. Accordingly, motion tracking 
technology can be used to incorporate visual cues from the therapist within VR sessions when interacting with 
individuals affected by CP. Unity 3D software was used to create the VR environment in this study. Considering that 
the users will be children with CP, the training “game” was produced to simulate a moving wheelchair in an urban 
environment. The different therapy training levels are provided by changing the driving speed of the wheelchair and 
the number of obstacles in the VR environment. The individual can control the wheelchair by only steering left or 
right. Additionally, Xsens MVN system was used to capture the full-body movement of one volunteer, which was 
selected as the caregiver’s action for patients to follow. Given the unique compatible feature of Xsens and Unity 3D,

Abstract 
 
The revised 1994 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s NIOSH Lifting Equation (NLE) is widely 
used to assess the risk of injury to the spine by providing estimates of the Recommended Weight Limits (RWL) for 
hands.  This adaptive snow-sports (skiing/snowboard) study uses the predictive equations to identify lifting situations 
that put adaptive instructors at risk (>2.0 LI) for lower back injuries during a routine lift of a sit-ski onto a chairlift.  
Using NIOSH lifting equation calculations, along with predictive equations of spinal loads using the trunk and pelvic 
flexion, have identified that under the RWL’s calculated during our lifting activities, spinal loads exceed the 
recommended safe compression and shear force levels.

1. Introduction 
The original survey data was collected to find, eliminate barriers, and other issues may hinder people from 
participating actively in the sport (>3 times) along with any equipment issues they may have with adaptive snow-
sports (skiing and snowboarding) used in the industry today.  Through research collected during the 2018/2019 snow-
sports season from various resorts across the United States, the study identified that manual lifting of adaptive sit-skis 
was a significant issue.  Fifty-one percent of these instructors have been involved with the sport for >20 years.  They 
come from across the United States with variable years of experience in adaptive snow-sports.  Our survey data was 
collected from 85+ people that are either adaptive snow-sports instructors, participants, and manufacturers, which 
including Professional Ski Instructors of America (PSIA) and Rehabilitation Engineering Society of North America 
(RESNA).  Comparing statistical data to simplify the top three issues while comparing variables to identify other 
issues after cost, being number one, with data collected from both groups (participants and instructors). Many areas 
may have different or similar barriers to participation, but that will be discussed in the full report.  Many equipment 
problems have been compared to both groups as well, so we can identify what each group sees as a problem. Using 
the equipment issues and barriers to participation, categorized them for analysis, graphing the similar variables, and 
compare them to what the instructors see as an issue versus the participants' view.  We started to see trends after 
calculating some basic statistics.  After removing the geographic information, we started to see what similar 
issues/barriers are common to both groups.  Identifying these similarities and common trends, we can seek out future 
solutions to these problems and improve the future of the adaptive snow-sports industry.  The one major area for 
improvement was chairlift loading and unloading for both groups of people surveyed.  They both identified this as an 
area that needed improvement. 
 
2. Research 
Study scored the issues/problems from the data collected and input them according to coding by number.  (0, 10, 20, 
etc.) Numbers are the same for both groups analyzed (participants/instructors) then prioritized the issues identifying 
lifting as number one next to cost. Additionally, NLE data were calculated using real-life lifting scenarios that were 
measured in the field.  Additional ergonomic software programs were used (Ergonomics Plus and Jack Software) to 
verify lift analysis.

Abstract  
Creating a safe work environment is essential and a top priority. One indicator of the work environment assessment 
is to assess the safety culture applied by the company's management. A good safety culture will successfully prevent 
potential hazards in the workplace and vice versa. Therefore, this study aimed to develop the Repository Safety 
Model Canvas (Repository SMC) as a tool to improve safety culture maturity based on best practices in scientific 
articles about Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). Additionally, it aimed to measure safety culture based on 
seven dimensions of the safety model canvas (commitment, leadership, responsibility, competence, engagement & 
involvement, information & communication, and organizational learning). Furthermore, it validated the SMC 
repository using a case study of PT. Prima Alam Gemilang provided recommendations for improvements to 
companies implementing the SMC repository. Data was collected by distributing questionnaires based on random 
cluster sampling to 112 workers. The results of the assessment of the maturity level of safety culture in the observed 
company obtained a value of 3,428 in the calculative category. This study showed the sequence of safety culture 
improvement that needed to be addressed by company management, starting from the dimensions of competence 
(1), commitment (2), engagement & involvement (3), organizational learning (4), information & communication (5), 
responsibility (6), and leadership (7). The smaller the number in the priority flow, which indicated the level of the 
tendency, required to be addressed first. Meanwhile, the strategic recommendations for each stage in the SMC 
Repository were determined based on the needs and suitability of the company's circumstances.

Introduction
The health and safety of the work environment often become determinant factors in assessing a company's success. 
No wonder various companies worldwide have high occupational health and safety regulations standards. It is 
directly proportional to the increasingly complex machine tools used at work, so special attention needs to be paid to 
prevent near-miss incidents. One indicator of the work environment assessment is to assess the safety culture applied 
by the company's management. A good safety culture will successfully prevent potential hazards in the workplace 
and vice versa. If the workplace safety culture is bad, there is a high possibility of potential accidents at work.  
Based on the International Labor Organization (ILO) data, 2.78 million people worldwide die every year due to 
work-related accidents. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the  Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) recorded 109,215 work-
related accidents and material losses, amounting to 213,866 million rupiahs in 2018. The increase in the number of 
work accidents was due to the lack of application of a safety culture in the work environment and the company's 
inconsistency in managing the occupational safety and health management system. Therefore, with a company that 
accommodates workers, it is necessary to pay attention to safety aspects to protect human resources. Workers are an 
important asset for companies that act as a driving force to achieve goals. 
According to Foster & Hoult (2013), the safety culture maturity level parameter consists of five stages: basic, 
reactive, planned, proactive, and resilient. A method or tool that can assist in mapping the condition of safety culture

management by demonstrating strong and consistent HSE leadership behaviors and characteristics. Provide real 
examples of positive habits related to work safety aspects that should be applied in daily life.   
 
4.6  Limitations 
Filling out questionnaires to employees was still done manually. It was because the SMC Repository was still in the 
refinement stage. Hopefully, in the future, regulations for filling out questionnaires could be done online through a 
questionnaire link that was integrated directly into the repository system so that the final results obtained were more 
accurate and used time more efficiently.   
    
5.0 Conclusion 
Combining two different components, namely the Repository and the Safety Model Canvas (SMC) method, was the 
latest combination in occupational safety and health. With the existence of the SMC Repository, hopefully, it can 
become a tool to increase the safety culture maturity in every company in Indonesia. The test results of the safety 
culture maturity assessment at PT. Priama Alam Gemilang obtained a maturity level value of 3,428. Furthermore, it 
was included in the calculative category. The order of priority aspects that need to be improved could be started 
from the dimensions of competence (1), commitment (2), engagement & involvement (3), organizational learning 
(4), information & communication (5), responsibility (6), and leadership (7). Meanwhile, the recommended solution 
in Figure 3 was a strategy that the company could apply to increase the safety culture's maturity level.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia’s 5G network deployment has faced challenges that have postponed the target to be available nationwide in 
2022. However, with its potential to improve the interconnectivity of the people and increase business efficiency and 
effectiveness, the government still pushed the deployment of the technology. Therefore, this research aims to better 
understand these challenges and opportunities by offering the systems perspectives on the adoption of 5G. The study 
identified the sub-component and its relationship in developing the ideal 5G network deployment systems using a 
modified soft system methodology. It also lists recommendations for improvement after comparing the actual and 
conceptual models.

1. Introduction 
The fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications network first launched in South Korea has many advantages. 5G uses 
lower energy and cost per link and supports more devices than the previous generation (Hutajulu et al., 2020). The 
use of a new generation of low-cost broadband data can encourage better communication in several areas such as 
education, social cohesion, exchange of ideas, access to information globally, science, learning, and the economy 
(Forge & Vu, 2020). Apart from having faster speeds, 5G also has reliable low latency and will allow the creation of 
several new services such as smart factories and automated driving [3]. Furthermore, 5G networks are becoming the 
only way to support high-performance and heterogeneous devices. More functional 5G features such as fixed cellular 
convergence, device-to-device (D2D) communication, ad-hoc meshing, and open access have made global interest in 
conducting research related to 5G high (Neokosmidis et al., 2017). Through faster services and extensive and more 
reliable network capacity, 5G technology will unlock the potential benefits for human-to-human communication and 
integrate human-to-machine networks and machine-to-machine communication networks (Indonesia Development 
Forum, 2021). 
 
The development of 5G in Indonesia is in the initial phase; this can be seen from last 2019. The Telkomsel operator 
has just conducted a 5G Operational Feasibility Test (ULO) at the Ministry of Communication and Information 
(Kominfo). Telkomsel also presented a 5G service trial “Telkomsel 5G Experience Center” at the 2018 Asian Games 
momentum and a “Telkomsel 5G for Industry 4.0” trial in Batam in 2019 (Erika Dyah Fitriani, 2021). Since May 
2021, Indonesia has only provided 5G services in 9 cities or algorithmic areas, including Jabodetabek, Bandung, 
Batam, Balikpapan, Makassar, Surakarta, Surabaya, Denpasar and Medan which only cover certain points (Novani et 
al., 2014). 
 
The 5G network was initially planned to be available in 2020 in Indonesia. Although it is expected to improve the 
quality of life of the people and improve the performance of business and industry in Indonesia, itas encountered 
several obstacles, so this deployment needs to be postponed (Hutajulu et al., 2020). 5G services are still in the 
development stage, so it is not easy to see a clear view of the future. However, making an initial estimate on 5G 
adoption is essential to best use the enormous opportunity. In addition, it is necessary to understand how to contribute 
to strategic policy based on the predicted demand (Jahng & Park, 2020). Before 5G can become a commercial reality,

5. Conclusion 
By employing a systems-based methodology such as SSM, we have seen the value of capturing the perceptions from 
a researcher’s point of view. To increase 5G adoption in Indonesia, it is necessary to calculate the 5G market demand 
to make investments by the government and investors, especially operators. There is also a need for reliable and 
affordable infrastructure and a digital ecosystem that supports 5G devices. Every actor needs to collaborate and 
communicate to accelerate the adoption of 5G networks in Indonesia. 
 
In this paper, the presented results are preliminary. Furthermore, research needs to explore and expand the model and 
validate it with reality by collecting the data from each actor related to adopting 5G networks.

Abstract 
 
The digital paradigm brings changes to markets and organizations need to adapt their strategy to survive. With a focus 
on achieving competitive advantage, companies must be aware of activities that add value, visualizing and analysing 
processes in a detailed way. Digitalization is an important concept when it comes to controlling the effectiveness and 
efficiency of processes, so companies are converting them in a technological dematerialized way. In this digital 
journey, business process management methods can be used to support the identification of sources of waste in 
processes and lean management can be applied to eliminate this waste.  This paper describes a Portuguese case study 
where a company from the construction sector applies Business Process Management (more concretely the BPMN 
2.0) to support the digitalization of one of the pillars of World Class Manufacturing, Cost Deployment, preserving the 
Lean Management philosophy that was already pursued by the company. The paper presents two models, the as-is 
model (process without a technological tool) and the to-be model (process with a technological tool) concerning the 
Cost Deployment process of the company under study, thereby reducing waste.

Abstract 
 
This study sought to examine the relationship between the components of emotional intelligence and SME’s 
performance. Using the resource-based view and the emotional intelligence concept as the theoretical 
foundations, a census of 1,532 SMEs was selected in the Accra Metropolis for the study.  Empirical results from 
717 SMEs, utilising the hierarchical linear regression model, revealed that owner/manger’s emotional 
intelligence can be used to help facilitate work relationships resulting in sales and market performances. 
Moreover, the study found that Emotional intelligence makes a positive effect on SMEs performance of small 
and medium-sized enterprises. The practical implications of the results are also discussed.

Abstract 
 
The fundamental goal of energy harvesting systems is to reduce the need for a wired power supply or battery 
replacements. Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting has been established as a viable alternative for powering 
mobile devices without increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission which is a threat to the environment. However, 
there are challenges facing the effective harvesting of appreciable energy for these devices. Low RF power harvestable 
from various sources and low radio frequency-direct current (RF-DC) conversion efficiency have made it a very 
difficult task to harvest sufficient power to drive mobile devices such as smartphones. Lower frequency RF sources 
could yield appreciable harvestable energy but this comes with the challenge of portable antennas that could match 
these frequencies. This paper presents various RF energy harvesting techniques in literature and discusses some of the 
difficulties encountered by researchers while designing RF energy harvesting circuits. The significance of adopting 
alternative renewable sources to power mobile devices in the face of the looming global energy crisis while avoiding 
global warming was highlighted. Additionally, suggestions for future work aimed at harvesting enough energy to 
power smartphones and other mobile devices were presented.

Abstract 
 
Currently, textile companies and industries in general dispose of a large amount of effluents which have a high amount 
of toxic substances, among them are colorants, mostly used in textile industries. Faced with this problem, treatment 
techniques or methods arise for the elimination of these colorants, among them is one of the most important as the 
adsorption method that is characterized by its effectiveness in the removal of colorants, the resulting activated carbon 
being the main However, this adsorbent agent is sometimes very expensive, so an ecological and low-cost alternative 
is the use of agro-industrial or agricultural residues as adsorbent agents. In this research, information is collected about 
agro-industrial residues that can eliminate dyes and assessing their adsorption effectiveness. By means of the PRISMA 
method and by means of a search strategy, 48 articles were obtained, which we dedicated to carrying out and achieving

1. Introduction 
According to Maattanen et al. (2019), the annual consumption of textile fibres has increased over the past decade, 
from 50 million tonnes to more than 70 million tonnes. The textile industry is one of the most important in Peru 
(Santillán and Maza 2018), however, according to Castro et al. (2019), the environmental impact of this industry is 
related to the large amounts of water consumption, to the variety and quantity of chemicals used throughout all textile 
processing activities. In this sense, the effluents generated from the manufacturing, dyeing and finishing processes of 
textiles are very variable in composition and contain a complex mixture of toxic substances such as salts, metals, 
biocides, surfactants, pigments, dyes, among others. For the latter, and from the environmental point of view, their 
elimination is one of the main problems facing the textile sector. 
 
Also, dyes are very important chemicals for various industries such as food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, printing inks, 
leather, and plastic, however, the textile industry is the main consumer of dyes worldwide (Piaskowsk et al. 2018). 
 
The dyes are classified as cationic, anionic and non-ionic, depending on the ionic charge in the molecule, and it is the 
cationic dyes that have reported greater toxicity (Hincapié-Mejía et al. 2018). However, a more specific classification 
is proposed in Kaya (2021), the main dyes are grouped as acid dyes, basic dyes, direct dyes, mordant dyes, tub dyes, 
reactive dyes, dispersed dyes, azo dyes and sulfur dyes, where azo dyes account for 60-70% of all dyes. 
 
According to Saini (2018), the high concentration of dyes in water bodies stops the oxygenation capacity of the 
receiving water and cuts off sunlight, thus altering the biological activity of aquatic life and the photosynthesis process 
of aquatic plants such as algae. The polluting effects of these dyes are also due to their non-biodegradability, so they 
continue to accumulate in sediments, fish or other forms of aquatic life. 
 
The use of methods for the treatment of wastewater from the textile industry before it is discharged is intended to, 
firstly, meet the increasingly stringent requirements of the relevant regulations, secondly, to safeguard the aquatic 
ecosystem, and, thirdly, to have the capacity to reuse the water that is a main element in this industry.

Abstract 
 
The brewing industry has evolved over the years, attracting many customers. Therefore, due to the diversity of tastes 
and preferences, craft brewing companies were born, becoming the livelihood of thousands of families in the national 
territory. However, most of them are empirical or do not have a correct working method, which adds a lot of time and 
a complicated production process. In addition, there is a lack of efficient plant design and they do not consider order, 
cleanliness, and organization in their operations due to the precariousness of knowledge of improvement tools. 
Therefore, the main objective of this investigation is to increase productivity in the areas of supply and production 
through the development of an integrated model of 5S, Standardized Work, Systematic Layout Planning and TQM 
framework. Through the implementation of this Lean model and its corresponding simulation in Arena software, it 
was possible to increase productivity by 15.21%, increasing production and reducing times, in addition to increasing 
revenues by approximately PEN 24,000

1.Introduction  
In Latin America, alcoholic beverages have a strong cultural component in the different countries, as a result of the 
different habits associated with its consume. Thus, Peru ranks third in this region of the continent with a consumption 
of 8.1 liters per capita (Moreno, 2015). Now, moving on to the local industry, the most industrialized beer producer is 
Backus S.A.A., which is the leading company in the country, with a market share around 94.98% (Lizarzaburu et al., 
2018). However, despite that, there is an emerging interest in new products, other than the industrial sector, known as 
craft beers. This market is growing due to the evolution of tastes and preferences of customers, which increases the 
opportunities for these small competitors, with differentiated products known by the acronym of MSEs that have an 
important contribution in the industry and national employment, in that sense (Oficina de estudios económicos (OEE), 
2017), argues that this business segment represents 99.5% of all formal companies in the Peruvian economy, 94.9% are 
microenterprises, 4.5% are small and 0.2% are medium-sized (Quispe Orejón & Quintanilla Alarcón, 2018; Toro-
Gonzalez, 2017). 
 
It should be added that normally companies in the manufacturing sector, as the case of craft breweries, have a big 
problem in the management of their operations or activities, since within these, less than 5%, add value to the process, 
such as, for example, the correct management of resources by the logistic area. The 35% are necessary activities that 
do not add value, such as long waits, and 60% are unnecessary activities that do not add value, in particular, the 7 Lean 
wastes (Fallas-Valverde et al., 2018). If we add to this that manufacturing companies waste around 70% of their 
resources in the whole system, concluding that the main problem is the waste in the production area and the dependence 
on the import of raw materials, which could generate problems in the supply of MSMEs in the sector (Quispe Orejón 
& Quintanilla Alarcón, 2018; Vargas Hernández et al., 2016). 
 
This research focuses on a specific company in the craft brewing sector, which shows the sector's problem of limited 
production capacity and disorganization in supply, caused by operational waste and low productivity in relation to the 
liters produced by the company. It has been possible to identify a serious problem in the production and inventory

559","Observing that there is an increase in one of the processes; however, this does not affect the cycle time and production 
increases by 30 barrels of 50 liters, giving a total of 480 barrels per year. 
 
5.4 Validation  
The objective of this research was to reduce unproductive time, which aims to increase productivity by applying the 
integrated methodology described above. This model can be applied to any company in the cluster that wishes to 
increase its productivity, adding that this varies according to the organizational context; however, if improvement is 
required, the tools mentioned above can be taken into consideration. This study allowed discovering the relevance of 
lean manufacturing tools, which can positively influence not only the impact on productivity, but also in reducing costs, 
increasing income, increasing personnel utilization, increasing production, reducing cycle time, among others.The study 
currently shows that approximately 2,000 liters per month can be produced, for a total of 22,500 liters per year. Adding 
a high waiting time between processes which leads to not being able to produce at full capacity, so there is a slow 
production, since it should produce 450 barrels per year, thus obtaining an economic benefit of 360,000 PEN, adding 
an average cycle time of 3008.88 hours, thus giving the ones that the main causes are the excessive disorder in the 
production area and in the warehouses, excessive displacements due to poor design and lack of a working method. The 
proposed modeling focused on the supply and production domains, which caused serious problems to the excess 
production. In this comparative chart, a contrast can be observed between the current scenario and the improved one 
thanks to the tools mentioned above, together with the continuous improvement based on the TQM philosophy.

6. Conclusion  
The implementation of the three tools, SLP, 5S and Standardized Work, within the TQM framework in a craft brewing 
company, were useful and profitable, since, through the simulator, it was possible to increase productivity by 15.21%, 
along with an increase in annual economic profit of approximately PEN 24,000. In conclusion, it was possible to 
achieve the objectives of each of the indicators proposed in this article, and the overall performance of the company 
was correct. 
 
 Through the SLP, it was possible to reduce the raw material transportation times from 17.5 min to 4 min and the final 
disposal of the barrels with the product, since there was a significant approach from the raw material warehouse to the 
production area and an adequate space was added for the barrels ready for sale, adding the benefit of the 5S and 
Standardized Work, a reduction in the times of each process between 9 to 15%.  For future work, it is recommended 
to emphasize every part of the supply chain, in order to find improvements in different areas. Furthermore, it is 
recommended to explore in depth, not only the craft breweries, but also various small businesses and propose 
substantial improvements, improving the quality of life of the citizens.

Abstract 
  
The objective of this research was to analyze the results of a service company in the real estate sector in Peru, with the 
aim of improving the current sales process. The study began with an initial audit where it was possible to identify the 
causes of why the company wasn’t achieving more sales. These were the little order around work of the salesmen, a 
non-standardized sales process, and few control processes. These causes were identified in the diagnosis stage using 
engineering analysis tools such as the Ishikawa diagram, SIPOC, and Pareto diagram. After that, a model focused on 
the stages of the Deming cycle was used as a philosophical tool that gave us an order to apply the 5S tool and the 
Standardized Work tool; achieving the order of the offices, a standardized process, and finally, the implementation of 
simulation software named Arena let us measure the company results. After the implementation of the model, sales 
were projected to increase, the use of human resources was reduced by 8.54%, reprocesses in customer contact were 
eliminated and the percentage of sales efficiency grew by 65% compared to the leads received.

1. Introduction   
The real estate sector makes a large contribution to the Peruvian GDP. In 2018 the contribution was 6.4%. The 
economic growth of the sector has been reflected year after year because of the housing increase demand. Lima the 
capital of Peru, had 18,055 homes sold in 2019, representing a growth of 15.6% over the previous year (De Paula 
2018). Given the importance of the sector and knowing that the housing demand will probably increase soon, it 
becomes necessary to try new sales methods to increase real estate sales. In this case, we analyzed an enterprise named 
Innova180. This enterprise belongs to the real estate sector. The main objective of the study was to increase the number 
of sales of Innova180 this year. To begin with the study, we analyzed the current situation of the enterprise and defined 
our goals. The first goal was to increase sales and the second was to reflect the importance of the engineering tools 
used in the process.  The third goal was to give the enterprise a process ready to be used in the future with great 
efficiency.  
 
First, we identified that the process wasn’t fluid. A spending increase was reflected due to reprocessing, made by the 
salesmen, that didn’t have a supervised order while doing the process (Yik and Chin 2019). These types of problems 
have been identified in many types of research around the world. For example, in a medium-sized production company 
located in West Sumatra, Indonesia, 12% of its monthly production was defective. That generated an impact on their 
monthly spending since the loss of products represented approximately 360 dollars per month. After applying the 5S 
tool, the number of defectives was reduced to 0% in just one month (Zadry et al. 2020). Another research carried out 
in Tunisia, showed that in a small or medium-sized company (SME) in the textile sector, the low productivity rate was 
due to long waiting times due to the high cycle times in the production process, which leads to a lack of compliance 
with customers and losses for the medium-sized company. The application of PDCA (Deming cycle) in conjunction 
with DMAIC managed to reduce waiting times from 39.47 days to 30.23 days and increase production from 0.5 to 1.3. 
(Nedra et al. 2019). Everything mentioned above shows that mediums and small companies, regardless of the continent 
where they are developed, have processes that can be improved, so it is important to continue investigating new 
solutions to this problem. Because of that, and after evaluating the best tools for the study, we decided to use the 5S 
engineering tool to give the process an order. Finally, the Standardized Process tool was used to achieve our third

number of sales doubled.

Simulation of the proposed improvement   
 The simulation of the model was developed with the Arena software. To corroborate its efficiency, 2 simulations were 
run, one of the current processes and the other of the proposed improvement. For this, the tools of the model presented 
were used.   
For the sales process, the Standardized Work was used to be able to leave the process in use and standardized, and thus 
benefit the company from the proposed improvements.    
It is important to mention that past research has shown similar positive results by applying the tools proposed in the 
model. This research is shown in figure 5.  
 
  
 
Figure 5. Improved process review  
  
6. Conclusion  
The importance of the study was demonstrated by achieving the results as expected. Using these engineering tools was 
key to achieving great results.  
The number of sales was doubled, while the leads needed for one sale went from 200 to 70. Thus, the improvement in 
sales efficiency was notorious.   The standardization of the process using work tools has made it possible to organize 
workers, establish control measures to execute action plans at the right time and make better use of the company's 
resources. The process shows that engineering tools are applicable to these types of companies, if the company 
continues to grow it is important to continue reviewing concepts and processes to achieve the desired continuous 
improvement.  A study of this nature was never made before. The importance of the engineering tools used in the real 
estate sector in a third-world country was demonstrated in the study. This type of analysis can be used in any sector to 
create more efficient processes, and that will contribute to the development of this type of nation.

Abstract 
 
Gradually the urban freight transport to final consumers is gaining relevance worldwide, with a rapid adoption 
stimulated also by the global health crisis. This also brings to the attention of the world interest regarding its carbon 
footprint and sustainability; therefore, our objective is to present a review on the diverse ways in which it is proposed 
to lessen the impact of last mile logistics. For this, a systematic literature review was conducted, using the prism 
method and the VOS Viewer literature analysis tools. The analysis found a growing interest in the subject, along with 
proposals in every aspect of the logistics process. The main concern is the actual transportation of the items and the 
preferred measures to ensure sustainability were the proposals for alternative vehicles, which proved to have the 
greatest effectiveness in the sustainable development of logistics activities.

1. Introduction 
Due to recent worldwide events, last mile logistics has had received a great boost due to the massive adoption of e-
commerce, as Gee et al. (2021) indicates, retail is reporting increases in online sales of up to 500%, since online sales 
represent a safer alternative in the face of the global public health crisis. This situation has forced retailers to implement 
home delivery as part of their processes to remain competitive. In face of these changes, we believe that it is 
appropriate not only to consider the economic side on their implementation, but also their sustainability, since a good 
business model must consider its stability over time. 
 
This article is a literature review on the different mechanisms, proposals, and perspectives to address sustainability in 
the management of last mile logistics’ (LML) processes. Edwards et al. (2010), supported the idea that there is no 
significant difference between the methods offered by e-commerce, compared to the traditional method of purchase 
in a physical store, but since the delivery process is no longer in the hands of the consumer but managed by the 
businesses themselves, opening the door for methods standardization. M. Staniek and G. Sierpiński (2016) proposed 
the use of alternative means of transportation, such as electric vehicles to minimize emissions, as well as route 
improvements, different applications of crowdsourced logistics, as a method of improvement in LML, which would 
have a good impact on its sustainability. 
 
1.1. Last Mile Logistics (LML) 
According to B. Huang et al. (2021), last mile logistics is the most critical component within the growing e-commerce 
industry and must respond to various problems presented by its demand, such as balancing high variety of products 
and optimizing the movement of low volumes of products per order, where one of the most crucial elements is time. 
It is this set of elements that we will be engaging in our research, in short, it is mostly the B2C (business-to-consumer) 
environment, where a business has the responsibility of getting the product or service to the end consumer, as opposed 
to traditional purchasing. This process has the potential to eliminate venue costs, as the customer no longer has the 
need to go to a specific location to obtain their products.

4. Discussion 
The authors do not prove a single way in which sustainability can be incorporated into last mile logistics, as there are 
multiple methods as there are different cities, different contexts, and different capabilities. This is one of the main 
obstacles to the implementation of sustainable practices, homogeneity makes it easier to launch large-scale projects, 
heterogeneity hinders their adoption. For example, according to Serrano et al. (2021) The bike solution is a suitable 
alternative in cases of low accessibility, and short distances, the same with the rest of the strategies that rely on 
alternative vehicles. Resat (2020) wrote that lower impact fuels grant less travel to vehicles, so it would force the 
dispersion of distribution centres to reach destinations. According to Villa and Monzón (2021), resource collaboration 
is one of the most adopted methods in recent years since it has already yielded positive results in its implementation. 
If each company were exclusively in charge of its products and/or services, there would be a redundancy of trips, so 
many have opted (for economic reasons) for the consolidation of orders, so that it is one who oversees the distribution 
of many. 
 
It is also observable, as, in many of the improvement cases, methods are used that were designed primarily to decrease 
operating costs, which shows us that sustainability can be a side effect of the search for financial reasons and is also 
the best way to encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices. 
 
It is seen in the case studies that the countries where sustainable methods are implemented and experimented with are 
mostly developed countries Bi et al. (2020), which shows a correlation between the economic situation of a country 
and the interest in sustainable proposals (Galati et al., 2020). 
 
5. Conclusions 
It is concluded that the main obstacles in last mile logistics are found in transportation (25%), followed by gas 
emissions (22.6%) and waiting times (20.2%). Therefore, any proposal must be prepared to address these obstacles. 
Regarding the main strategies that seek to ensure the sustainability of last mile logistics is, first, the integration of 
digital technologies in the use of e-commerce, saw in the score of 32.1% among the items seen. Since, both in data 
mining, as in the different planning methods, the use of digital means eases the optimization of available resources, 
not only affecting the final logistics costs, but also in reducing the carbon footprint. The second proposal is about 
alternative transportation (31%), whose attractiveness lies in the use of renewable energies and taking pollution out of 
urban areas. Regarding the impediments to the implementation of new methods capable of ensuring sustainability, 
one of the main obstacles is operational costs, mentioned in 33.3% of the cases. Implementation stands for a first cost 
overrun, which for small businesses is not easy to overcome. This reason goes hand in hand with the lack of 
infrastructure (22.6%), which is difficult to overcome if the current business does not have sufficient income margins. 
It is also worth mentioning that another major factor is the lack of innovation, which can exist due to a lack of resources 
as well as disinterest on the part of the company. The preferred proposal among the authors includes alternative 
vehicles, both drones and electric vehicles, depending on the density and urban distribution of each delivery area. 
Where despite requiring multiple trips, it is still more sustainable compared to traditional transport. Finally, as a 
conclusion we can mention that the review articles have transportation as the main obstacle of last mile logistics, and 
the implementation of small and environmentally friendly vehicles are the most practical solution. However, operating 
costs and lack of infrastructure are an obstacle, but that can be solved with the use of environmentally friendly 
alternative transport (bicycles) associated with new digital technologies for logistics optimization.

Abstract 
 
 The Philippines is one of the world's most well-known tourist destinations, with hotels and services located all over 
the country. Due to the current pandemic crisis's demands, hotel management's current system has struggled to keep 
up with the new normal, resulting in significant changes and the loss of some business scope and profit. The 
researchers used design thinking to empathize with the people, identify the problem, and create solutions that resolved 
the difficulties and customer experience at the hotels. In conducting the methodology, there was a significance related 
to health limitations and mandated protocols, manual registration, waiting time, a shortage of staff and workloads, 
customer satisfaction, and advertising, which were the most prevalent difficulties in the current manual process of 
hotels and most of the computerized hotel systems that were experienced by using the first design thinking method, 
Empathize. The researchers utilized Personas, Points of View (POVs), and How Might We (HMWs) to identify the 
results through the problems and needs from the general idea of the empathizing method. The results of using the 
design thinking methodology were having an improved system with an efficient database and information systems 
design regarding hotel management with the emergence of compliance on health protocols and requirements, lessened 
waiting time, efficient workplace, customer satisfaction, and effective advertisement were attained. Therefore, the 
researchers conducted system planning, analysis, and design by addressing challenges in developing functionality 
design into the User Interface, aided by reports and interviews with hotel employees and customers.

1. Introduction  
Tourism plays a significant role in a country's economy, specifically in the Philippines which the hotel management 
contributes vastly to the tourism and business industry. It has a significant economic impact, as many hotels in every 
part of the Philippines cope with human processing rather than automated processing because, before the pandemic, 
it was still manageable even without automation. However, there were times when they were inconsistent with their 
employees regarding trends and preferences emerging through the clients. As customers seek comfort and security 
similar to their homes in their chosen hotels, it also affects a management system's performance which later on affects 
the ability of the country to compete in regards to businesses and tourism. As a result, to keep up with their fast-paced 
lives, customers must demand continuous improvements in the quality of the hotel management system and hotel 
services such as room reservations.  Emerging hotel trends and client preferences significantly impact the ever-
changing community, such as the emergence of a pandemic, which completely changes the perception of the need for 
an automated system for streamlining internal and external processes. Automation is beneficial not only for creating 
features but also for all activities involved in the hotel management system, which can enhance the Philippines' 
economy if given the priority and application shown in other nations. A factor of an automated management system 
is the exploration of possibilities on how other countries can increase tourism and advance their economies, such as 
system software for internal productivity, artificial intelligence, environmental sustainability, mobile-friendly, guest 
preferences and reviews, and time-efficiency.  The researchers have chosen the hotel management system to restore 
tourism, support entrepreneurs and business persons, and boost economies that have been greatly influenced 
negatively by the pandemic. Researchers plan to integrate technology with hotels to automate and provide an efficient

591","Figure 6. Customer Receipt 
 
After the customer has made their decision, the system will take them to the payment page, where they can pay using 
digital money such as GCash, PayMaya, or a Credit Card. The customer will receive confirmation from the hotel that 
their payment has been received after they have selected a payment option. Then, they would be directed to the receipt 
page by the system. 
 
6. System Evaluation 
 Many hotels do not have a proper automated system based on their operations. Many manual processes take time, 
and people at the front desk occasionally make simple mistakes that waste time. Customers are particularly wary of 
handwritten information because it might be easily misplaced. Another pointless requirement is that the customer 
waits for another 10 to 20 minutes after completing the registration form. Customers would not have to wait or return 
to the hotel if we implemented our proposed solution because we created a simple system to use and accessible to 
adults. In our proposed system, we have provided a secure and trusted system so that customers' personal information, 
where they live, and their payment information, are kept safe. The system also includes an easy-to-understand interface 
so that clients may use it without difficulty. It can also make special requests, such as groceries or extra beds, so they 
do not have to go through the walking to the front desk, especially since we are in the middle of a pandemic. Customers 
might choose to pay with digital money, such as the use of Gcash, via Card, or Paymaya, so that it would not be a 
problem for them to go outside their own homes. Because we are amid the pandemic, our primary concern is the safety 
of our customers and employees. Because health is our top priority right now, there should be limited or much better 
avoiding any physical contact with many people. This health protocol is highly implemented by both our personnel 
and our consumers. 
 
7. Conclusion  
The customers, employees, and owners continuously demand improvements on their current system, mainly due to 
the pandemic that forces them to adjust and work on changes that would not affect their profit, satisfy the customers, 
and maximize the workforce. The researchers chose the hotel management system to aid in restoring tourism, 
supporting businesses and business people and strengthening the pandemic's economies. To do this, researchers plan 
to focus on identifying gaps and possibilities while establishing hotel management processes and improving the 
system's design. The researchers concluded that the design thinking methodology aided them in recognizing the 
problem and solving it by planning to create a design for a proposed system. It challenges assumptions to create 
innovative functionalities relevant to the beneficiaries' demands. The method relies on how people interact with their 
environment, what might be the situation today, such as a pandemic, and how people use the current system, as well 
as their feedback and experiences, which allows researchers to recognize a hands-on approach in determining a 
specific functionality for specific problems. To further identify, compulsory health restrictions have been developed 
due to the pandemic, which the researchers addressed by employing QR codes to identify and certify immunization. 
It should be introduced to remove physical contact in conjunction with the current use of paper and pen discouraged. 
Some functionalities have lower customer and employee interaction, such as real-time alerts for employees and

and provide excellent service that makes the customer happy. As a result, the proposal considered the issues from 
every angle when developing system design functionalities. However, the system design needs more analysis and 
ideation. The researchers highly recommend the same study for further analysis and system implementation in the 
future.

Abstract  
 
Loyalty of the firm’s customers has been recognized as the dominant factor in a business organization’s success. 
Service quality and price are vital competitive policy to keep customer support and build great base. Beauty salons 
are trying to win customer loyalty by delivering good quality services, competitive price, and also make sure that 
customers are satisfied. This study is aimed to analyze the influence of service quality and price either simultaneously 
or partially to customer satisfaction, service quality and price either simultaneously or partially to customer loyalty, 
customer satisfaction to customer loyalty, service quality, price, and customer satisfaction simultaneously to customer 
loyalty, service quality to customer loyalty through customer satisfaction, and price to customer loyalty through 
customer satisfaction. This study is conducted in Capillus Hair Care Center with 100 respondents. This study uses 
Path Analysis Method and also includes validity test, reliability test, and classical assumption. The results of the study 
indicate that service quality and price either simultaneously or partially have a positive significant influence to 
customer satisfaction; customer satisfaction has a positive significant influence to customer loyalty; service quality, 
price, and customer satisfaction simultaneously have a positive significant influence to customer loyalty; service 
quality has a positive significant influence to customer loyalty through customer satisfaction, and price has a negative 
significant influence to customer loyalty through customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction  
Globalization era, significant developments happen in various aspects, including technology, science, and economics. 
Globalization itself influences almost all aspects of society in the world especially in Indonesian society, which creates 
competitiveness to be the best in particular aspects. Rapid business development has been creating lots of new 
businesses established either small one, middle one, or a bigger one. It makes the service industry such as the beauty 
salon industry grows quickly. Each beauty salon is required to understand the needs and wants of the consumers. 
Beauty salons that want to survive must have a value that makes them different from other beauty salons. In this case, 
offering more value will give satisfaction to consumers and push the existing customers to return to the stores. Beauty 
salons in business should always observe the changes in consumer behavior.

Based on the table above, in the mediation test of service quality on customer loyalty through customer satisfaction, 
a t count of 1.978 was obtained. Because the value of t count (1.978) > t table (1.96), it is concluded that Ho is rejected. 
Thus, it means that customer satisfaction mediates between service quality and customer loyalty with a coefficient 
value of 0.14405. 
 
In the price mediation test of customer loyalty through customer satisfaction, a t count of 1.910 was obtained. Because 
the value of t count (1.910) < t table (1.96), it is concluded that Ho is accepted. Thus, it means customer satisfaction 
does not mediate between price and customer loyalty with a coefficient value of 0.09056. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the result and description of the research above, it can be concluded that: 
1. Quality service (X1) measured by customer satisfaction (Y) has a significant effect as seen from the Sig value of 
0,000 (Sig <0.05) and the magnitude of the service quality effect which directly influences customer satisfaction 
is (0.509) 2 = 0.259 = 25.9% and the remaining 74.1% is influenced by other factors outside this study. Thus, 
quality service has a positive and significant effect to customer satisfaction, hypothesis 1 is accepted. 
 
2. Price (X2) measured by customer satisfaction (Y) has a significant effect as seen from the Sig value of 0,000 
(Sig <0.05) and the magnitude of the price effect that directly influences to customer satisfaction is (0.320) 2 = 
0.102 = 10.2% and the remaining 89.8% is influenced by other factors outside this study. Thus, price has a 
positive and significant effect to customer satisfaction, hypothesis 2 is accepted. 
 
3. Quality service (X1) and price (X2) simultaneously measured by customer satisfaction have a significant effect 
as seen from the Sig value of 0,000 (Sig <0.05) and the magnitude of the effect of service quality and price on 
customer satisfaction is (0.546) 2 = 0.298 = 29.8% and the remaining 70.2% is influenced by other factors outside 
this study. Thus, the quality of service and price can affect the level of customer satisfaction, hypothesis 3 is 
accepted. 
 
4. Quality service (X1) has a significant effect on customer loyalty (Z) as seen from the Sig value of 0.001 (Sig 
<0.05) and the magnitude of the quality service effect directly on customer loyalty are (0.327) 2 = 0.106 or 10.6% 
and the remaining 89.4% is influenced by other factors outside this study. So, it can be concluded that service 
quality has a significant direct effect on customer loyalty, hypothesis 4 is accepted. 
 
5. Price (X2) directly has a significant effect on customer loyalty (Z) as seen from the Sig value of 0.006 (Sig <0.05) 
and the magnitude of the price effect directly on customer loyalty are (0.251) 2 = 0.063 or 6.3% and the remaining 
93.7% is influenced by other factors outside this study. So, it can be concluded that the price has a significant 
direct effect on customer loyalty, hypothesis 5 is accepted. 
 
6. Customer satisfaction (Y) as measured by customer loyalty (Z) has a positive and significant effect as seen from 
the Sig value of 0.006 (Sig <0.05) and the magnitude of the effect of customer satisfaction directly to customer 
loyalty is (0.283) 2 = 0.08 = 8% and the remaining 92% is influenced by other factors outside this study. Thus, 
customer satisfaction has a significant direct effect on customer loyalty, hypothesis 6 is accepted. 
 
7. Service quality (X1), price (X2), and customer satisfaction (Y) directly have a significant effect on customer 
loyalty (Z) as seen from the Sig value of 0,000 (Sig <0.05) and the magnitude of the influence of service quality, 
price, and customer satisfaction directly on customer loyalty is (0.557) 2 = 0.310 or 31% and the remaining 69% 
is influenced by other factors outside this study. So, it can be concluded that the quality of service, price, and 
customer satisfaction have a significant direct effect on customer loyalty at Capillus Hair Care Center, hypothesis 
7 is accepted.

609","8. Service quality (X1) indirectly influences customer loyalty (Z) through customer satisfaction (Y) with a total 
effect of (0.14405) 2 = 0.0207 or 2% and the remaining 98% is influenced by other factors outside this study. So, 
it can be concluded with the existence of good service quality can increase customer loyalty if Capillus Hair Care 
Center’s customer satisfaction is met, hypothesis 8 is accepted. 
 
9. Price (X2) indirectly does not affect customer loyalty (Z) through customer satisfaction (Y) with a total effect of 
(0, 0.09056) 2 = 0.008 or 0, 8% and the remaining 99.2% are influenced by other factors outside this study. Price 
indirectly has a smaller effect than direct application. So, it can be concluded that the application of price 
indirectly does not affect customer loyalty through customer satisfaction at Capillus Hair Care Center, hypothesis 
9 is not accepted. 
 
The result and the conclusion of this study, there are some of suggestions: 
1. The result shows that service quality and price have strong influence on customer satisfaction, it means that if 
the quality of service in Capillus hair care center improved, it will increase customer satisfaction levels. While, 
if the offered price is more varied then the customer satisfaction will be increased. Capillus hair care center must 
maintain the level of service quality that it currently has, such as always make sure that all the equipment that 
used by customers are clean and in a good condition. Furthermore, Capillus hair care center must offer more 
affordable price or give discount in special period, it will have effect on customer satisfaction. 
 
2. The result indicates that customer satisfaction is significant to customer loyalty, which means when customer 
satisfaction increases it will increase customer loyalty. Customers will feel satisfy when their needs can be 
fulfilled by the service that they use. Therefore, Capillus Hair Care Center must maintain and improve customer 
satisfaction through things that have been favored by customers such as adequate and modern salon facilities, 
cleanliness of the place, hygienic procedures, friendliness and skills of employees, and the existence of a loyalty 
card program where customers will get free one treatment if they have done the treatment at least ten times at 
the Capillus Hair Care Center. 
 
3. The service quality has strong influence to customer satisfaction and customer loyalty than price. It means that 
customers who satisfy with the service will recommend the service to other people and they will also increase 
their purchase intention. Quality Service can be increased by improving continuously the quality of its human 
resources and by doing innovation to improve the value of facility which is supporting the quality service. 
 
4. From this study, Capillus hair care center will see the factors that must be prioritized and not to be prioritized. 
Service quality and price are two factors that must get special attention. Capillus must focus on the direct way of 
service quality and price to reach the customer loyalty. It may not give special attention on indirect way to get 
the loyalty because this study shows that customer can be a loyal customer without feeling satisfied. When the 
customers feel that the service quality is good and price is worth the service, the customers will be loyal to the 
salon.

Abstract 
 
STIRPAT model is employed to review Indonesia's carbon emission's residential and demographic aspects. Indonesia 
is on its way to combat carbon emissions. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world, with the current 
population reaching 275 million in 2020. The country also faced massive economic growth following the growth of 
population, positioned at 7th in terms of GDP. With the current growth in population and economy, it is needed to 
identify whether this growth, which also induced by the decision of the population in expanding their family members, 
could influence the increase of the nation’s carbon emission. The effect of some aspects not included in the official 
government plan, namely population, economy, and residential aspect, is included in the estimation model. Household 
energy consumption is one of the most significant contributors to Indonesia's Energy-based emissions. Therefore, this 
paper tries to see whether population size and household could impact Indonesia's carbon emissions. Due to 
multicollinearity detected on the OLS estimation of the STIRPAT model, the model is regressed the second time using 
ridge regression. The result shown that Non-Dependent Population (DEP) > Economic Inequality (GINI) > energy 
consumption (EC) > Total Population (TP) > Urbanization (U) > Household Energy Consumption (HEC) > Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) > Household Expenditure (EXP) > Family Size (FAM) > Total Fertility Rate (TFR). It is 
then found that the economic aspect is the most significant contributor to the carbon emission increase. Therefore, 
suggestions regarding carbon emission could focus on improving the economy, especially improvement in green 
industrialization and economic equality for the population. However, mitigation from population aspects could not be 
overlooked, as the population aspect contributes to driving the increase of carbon emission.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2021. It was stated on the commitment that 
Indonesia pledged to reduce 26% of GHG emissions by itself or 41% with international aid in 2030. The energy 
component will be reduced to 11% unconditionally and 15.5% conditionally from the total business-as-usual (BAU) 
2010 GHG emission scenario. In realizing the 1.5°C world, nations should have massive ambition in reducing GHG 
emissions. Indonesia is one of the nations which not seriously committed to this matter (Dong et al. 2018). This fact 
is also strengthened by the research made by Climate Action Tracker (2020), which stated that the Indonesians should 
do more than what they are committed to in the NDC document. 
 
In realizing the emission commitment, perhaps it is crucial to add other aspects with the hope of inducing more 
reduction to GHG emission. Stern et al. (1992) identified five human-caused (anthropogenic) aspects that are 
significant in increasing GHG emission; population growth, economic growth, technological change, political-
economic institutions, and attitudes and beliefs. Study of the population as a cause of the emission has emerged since 
years, mainly found out that population, referred by its size, growth, or by a percentage of the urban population, shares 
a significant portion of carbon emission contribution (Dietz and Rosa 1997; York et al. 2003; Kusumawardani and 
Dewi 2020).

612","1% increase of total population will increase carbon emission by 0.23%. We calculated that through 2000-2016 
population increased 1.34%. Therefore, multiplying the coefficient and annual growth rate gives us the value of the 
effect of population on change of environmental impact (Lin et al. 2009), which is 0.31%. Other variables like TFR, 
GDP per capita, and household expenditure also moderate carbon emission change with around 0.30%-0.40% of the 
effect. However, it experienced a higher annual increase than the others; GDP per capita and household expenditure 
seems not to affect carbon emission change as significantly as expected. Nevertheless, it was the Gini index, and total 
energy consumption shares the most significant effect on carbon emission change —dividing effect on change by 
dependent variable's average annual growth results in contribution degree of independent variables in affecting the 
dependent variable. Contribution to the change could determine the importance of the influence on environmental 
change (Lin et al. 2009, Lin et al. 2017). Gini index and total energy consumption contribute the most to changes in 
carbon emission with 18% and 21% of contribution degree respectively. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Indonesia has missions to reduce its greenhouse gas emission and increase the welfare of its population. Recent data 
shows that the Gini index is still increasing over time, meaning that the inequality of Indonesians' income distribution 
is not yet to be mitigated. Kusumawardani and Dewi (2020) also confirm that Indonesian income inequality could 
increase carbon emission, thus need to be reduced. This problem then can be addressed as to how a wealthier portion 
of the population could degrade the environment while sharing the impacts with the poor (McGee and Greiner 2018). 
Research employing the STIRPAT model also confirmed that the economy could affect carbon emission. The increase 
of economy induces the ability of the population to consume products, for example, energy, food, or transportation, 
thus causing the increase of carbon emission (Liddle 2011; Ratanavaraha et al. 2015; Shahbaz et al. 2017). We 
illustrate how household financial ability increase could drive carbon emission, which also contributes much to the 
emission changes. 
 
Energy consumption could be influenced by many things, including urbanization (Lin et al. 2009; Haseeb et al. 2016) 
and economy (Lin et al. 2009). It is said that the rising economy affluence between populations will increase energy 
consumption through industrialization processes, commercial and everyday uses (Ratanavaraha et al. 2015, Yang et 
al. 2021). The rise of energy consumption led to carbon emission through its production, then its usage (Liddle 2011, 
Yang et al. 2021). Indonesia's carbon emission caused by energy consumption comes from coal, fossil fuel, and natural 
gas IEA (2020). Therefore, perhaps mitigation by employing renewable energy sources could answer energy-based 
carbon emissions. Haseeb et al. (2016), Usman and Hammar (2021), Zuo et al. (2020) also confirmed that renewable 
energy could help in decreasing carbon emission through statistical calculation. 
 
Much research has investigated the effect of the population on the increase of carbon emissions. Like Lin (2017) and 
Usman and Hammar (2021), other studies involving the population also found that population is a crucial influence in 
the increase of environmental impact. At the same time, Ratanavahara et al. (2015) found out that population indirectly 
influences carbon emission by transportation as its authentic influencer. Indonesia has been on its way to mitigating 
population bursts by employing several programs, including planned family. While not as strict as China's One-Child 
Policy, this program only suggests families limit their children only up to 2. Indonesia's Central Statistical Agency 
(BPS) predicts that Indonesia's population will increase until 2045, despite the total fertility rate (TFR) reaching 2.1. 
We can see through this measure that eventually, the population will influence the increase of carbon emissions. The 
result shows that the decreasing TFR and average family size help in giving negative impact to Indonesia's carbon 
emission increase, indicating the decision of having fewer children will reduce carbon emission. We also illustrated 
that the productive age population (people aged 15-64) could drive carbon emission increase from their activities. This 
has been confirmed through some research (Liddle 2011), and mitigation could come from energy usage limitations 
(Yang et al. 2021), employment of renewable energy to industries, and transportation (Ratanavahara et al. 2015), or 
the decision to limit the number of children in a family. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Indonesian carbon emission drivers could be illustrated through STIRPAT analysis. The non-dependent population 
affects carbon emission increase the most. Though so, the economic aspect (GDP per capita, household expenditure, 
and Gini index) play the contribute the most to the increase of Indonesia’s carbon emission, followed by the energy 
aspect (total energy consumption, household energy consumption), and lastly the population (total population, 
urbanization, TFR, and average family size). Non-dependent population, which is the productive population plays a 
big role in pushing the country’s economy forward. Improvement in the economy could then improve technology, 
thus increasing industrial production and energy usage (Yang et al. 2021). As much research suggests, mitigating

621","carbon emission through the economy could employ green economy regulation (Yang et al. 2021), develop eco-
friendly technologies (Usman and Hammar 2021), and tackle economic inequality (McGee and Greiner 2018; 
Kusumawardani and Dewi 2020). The Indonesian government could also implement green energy to provide energy 
usage for households, reducing emissions from this sector, as some research suggests (Zhao et al. 2022). The 
encouragement of family planning could also be considered in mitigating carbon emissions. 
 
This research has illustrated how population, economic, and residential energy consumption. However, some flaws 
and limitations to this research could be reviewed and improved. Future research regarding carbon emission in 
Indonesia can implement panel research consisting of 34 provinces in Indonesia to reduce bias on emission each 
province produces.

Abstract  
 
The global paint industry has a reach valued at $209.4 billion for this year. At the national level in Peru, this sector 
represents 1.27% of GDP, so this industry is of utmost relevance since the national per capita consumption is low, 
therefore, there is a great margin for improvement of this. This article describes the implementation of an improvement 
model that uses forecasting tools and capabilities coupled with a simulation to increase compliance with paint 
production, therefore; the central problem is analyzed using the VSM tool, in which the root causes, percentage of 
value-added and non-added time of the process are identified. After implementation, the model increased compliance 
with production orders by 26.86%, increased availability of resin input by 27.92, % and decreased cycle times by at 
least 2.5%. 
 
Keywords  
Production orders, forecast models, paint industry, standard data, capabilities. 
 
1. Introduction  
Statista (2018) points out that for years globally the construction industry and the automotive and industrial coatings 
markets, in general, have been driving the growth in demand for the paint sector. For example, Asia and the Pacific 
constitute the highest demand in the sector, accounting for 45%. On the other hand, Liao et al. (2021) argue that the 
sector revolves in a changing and dynamic environment in which it depends a lot on its raw materials and laws that 
regulate the purchase of them, which to some extent requires excellent planning. Therefore, it is vital to optimize 
processes and reduce the times of activities that do not add value. In Peru, the current paint market has a current value 
of US$ 350 million and a volume of 40 million gallons, giving a per capita consumption of 1.3 gallons, understanding 
that there is potential to grow (Gestión 2016). Likewise, it has been identified that the low compliance of production 
in the sector is due to various factors such as lack of maintenance of the machines (Omoregbe 2017), lack of 
compliance with specifications (Patyal et al. 2021), lack of planning, skills/errors of operators in the tasks performed 
(Badeeb et al. 2017). Therefore, in this context, it is necessary for companies belonging to the paint sector to be more 
efficient in meeting demand, which ends up being measured in terms of being more productive and competitive at the 
same time. Therefore, a case study has been chosen that reflects the problems of the sector on the deficient fulfillment 
of production orders, in which the lack of availability of Resin, delays in quality control and reprocesses due to poor 
grinding were identified as the most frequent causes. Consequently, an improvement model has been developed to 
increase compliance using tools such as forecasting, instructions, and capacity management. In the same way, it is 
worth mentioning that the motivation lies in generating knowledge about forecasting tools, capacity management, and 
work methodologies in the paint sector which has been very little studied in recent decades demonstrating its 
effectiveness quantitatively. Finally, this scientific article is divided into five parts which are Introduction, State of the 
Art, Methodology, Validation, Results, Conclusions, and References. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
The general objective of this research is to increase compliance with production orders (COP) by at least 15%, which 
is oriented to the central problem identified. Consequently, it was proposed as specific objectives to achieve the 
forecast of the demand for Alkyres Asc resin - 70% for the optimization of the supply and increase of availability by 
more than 11% and, finally, to achieve the identification of the bottleneck operation using capacities. Among other 
aspects, the key contribution of the research by the researcher is to propose a forecast model for the company under 
study to improve its compliance indicator, considering the loss of income that this has generated, and at the same time, 
share knowledge with the research community about the industrial paints sector in small or medium-sized companies 
from a plant point of view.

This study corresponds to the implementation of an improvement proposal as an integrated system for the use of 
engineering tools in the manufacturing industry of industrial paints and coatings in Peru. In turn, the objectives of this 
work were the increase in compliance with production orders (COP) which is oriented to the central problem 
identified, consequently, the achievement of the increase in availability through the forecast model by patterns of 
behavior about the resin Alkyres Asc - 70%, finally, achieve the identification of the bottleneck operation through the 
use of capacity management in which it was possible to identify that the grinding process was the one that to some 
extent limited the pace of the production process, increasing waiting times and reducing productivity, which was 
reflected in the monetary loss due to non-compliance with production orders At the same time, a work instruction can 
be proposed regarding partial quality control inspections that to some extent generated work overload for the 
laboratory area.  The results obtained in the study show significant improvements in the lead time of processing, the 
operating cycle times, the availability of the main resin input, and to some extent a standardization for partial 
inspections.

1. Introduction 
The technology has brought some local government to create smart. Smart city improves outcomes that connect among 
stakeholders. Smart city creates smart tourism concept which potentially meets what the tourist needs in the destination 
(Khan et al., 2017). The smart tourism is an important program from the government in implementing smart city 
strategy because smart tourism is an evolutionary advancement from conventional tourism to digital tourism concept 
(Gretzel et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2014).  
 
The tourists consider that smart tourism destinations are able support them in gathering and integrating the data in one 
place (Koo et al., 2016). Smart tourism destination implements intelligent technology in supporting tourist’s need (Li, 
2017). Smart tourism destination is featured by digital services. The tourists are able gather and spread the tourism 
information precisely and accessibly (Li et al., 2017). Sustainable smart tourism provides solutions to social, 
economic, environmental and cultural problems (Gretzel et al., 2015).  
 
Several countries in Asia have been serious in implementing smart tourism (Koo et al., 2016). The governments in 
Southeast Asia such as in Singapore, Bandar Seri Begawan (Brunei Darussalam), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and 
Surabaya (Indonesia) have implemented smart tourism program in increasing the number of tourist (Hayati et al., 
2017; Lopes et al., 2019; Niculescu & Wadhwa, 2015; Straker & Wrigley, 2018; Yau et al., 2016). 
 
1.1 Objectives 
Based on the above background, the objective of this research is to discovering and analyzing the relationship between 
smart tourism experience, perceived value, memorable tourism experience, and destination loyalty.

Abstract 
 
In retail competition, coordination between suppliers and retailers to match the supply and demand is the key to 
increasing the overall supply chain profits. To ensure the achievement of the coordination objectives, a mechanism is 
needed that can guarantee profits for all supply chain members. This paper will provide an overview of the supply 
chain coordination mechanism when there is competition between retailers. This review will focus on two things, 
namely, supply chain coordination and competition between retailers that are influenced by promotional strategies 
and customer preferences. This study can provide information related to the existing supply chain coordination 
literature and retailer competition so that it can provide an overview of the limitations of research on supply chain 
coordination in retail competition.

1. Introduction 
Coordination among members has an important role in improving supply chain performance. This coordination 
requires each member of the supply chain to share information and take into account the impact of their actions on 
other members. The efforts made by each member to maximize their profits result in conflicting goals between supply 
chain members. As a result, overall supply chain profits will decline. Therefore, if a supply chain network is optimized 
as a whole, the level of decision consistency will increase and the profits will also increase (Nematollahi et al. 2017).  
 
In a supply chain system, a manufacturer who can be positioned as a supplier produces and sells products to several 
retailers and then the retailer adds value to a product and sells the finished product to the customer. Competition 
between retailers is inevitable when customer demand is price sensitive and some demand can be substituted (Xiao et 
al. 2007). More competition among retailers in the market will facilitate price comparisons, Boatwright et al. (2004) 
identified the impact of this, namely increasing price sensitivity and customers will be more responsive to price 
decreases when there is a temporary promotion. 
 
This paper aims to provide an initial literature review regarding supply chain coordination when retailers are 
competing and explore various coordination models proposed by previous research. The literature study was carried 
out in two stages, starting with a literature study on supply chain coordination when there was a retailer competition 
and then a literature study on retailer competition that was influenced by promotional strategies and customer 
preferences. The contribution of this paper is a complement to previous research on supply chain coordination and 
pricing strategies for retailers. This paper also provides a more comprehensive overview of future research 
opportunities in the supply chain.

5. Conclusion 
Through the explanation in this paper, we get a sufficient initial description regarding the supply chain coordination 
literature review when retailers are competing. Through this paper, there are also research gaps that become 
opportunities for further research. Exploration studies were carried out by mapping the previous literature on two 
topics, namely supply chain coordination and retailer competition, and retailer competition through pricing strategy 
and customer preference. Research in this area will be further developed by considering several factors that have not 
been explored in this paper such as capacity limitations, joint lot sizing, and other related factors.

questions, namely how to identify dimensions that can be used as a framework for the Indonesian digital banking 
transformation and how to measure the digital performance of all dimensions within the framework. This research has 
an important role in formulating DX performance in a comprehensive, systematic, and measurable manner. We 
conducted a literature review on the dimensions of digital transformation and the contribution of digital transformation 
to improving company performance. In PMS-DT IBI, we have formulated digital performance indicators (DPI), which 
are mapped into 23 dimensions spread across four perspectives: strategic management, ecosystem management, 
information technology, and organizational strategy. From a strategic management perspective, DPI is formulated on 
the dimensions of DX strategy, business model, finance, P3M (portfolio, program, and project), and operational 
management. In ecosystem management, DPI is mapped in terms of ecosystem design, customer, partnership, and 
value dimensions. The information technology perspective consists of DPI for the dimensions of enterprise 
architecture, IT GRC, IT capabilities, data governance, system development, new technology, and security. And the 
organizational strategy perspective consists of DPI for the dimensions of organizational design, competence, change 
management, culture, leadership, and innovation. This research contributes to the importance of defining performance 
indicators in all subsystems in general system theory and PMS-DT IBI will assist banks in managing DX performance 
as a managerial application.

1. Introduction 
With the advancement of the new economy, digitalization is the trend (Zhai et al. 2022). Digital transformation is the 
use of new digital technologies to enable major business improvements (Fitsgerald et al. 2014). The literature also 
refers to DX as applying digital technology in operations, business model innovation or digital strategy to create value 
for a firm (Dinh et al. 2015; Schallmo et al. 2017; Selimovic et al. 2021; Singh et al. 2021; Verhoef et al. 2021). 
According to the Annual Report on the Development of Global Digital Economy Competitiveness, the top three 
countries in economy-wide digitalization are the US, Singapore, and China (Shiyue, 2021). While it is natural that 
firms are interested in DX, it is not straightforward whether it may bring tangible benefits to firms and enhance 
shareholder value (Zhai et al. 2022). The use of various technologies in the financial services sector has brought 
significant changes to the Indonesian banking industry.

Abstract 
 
Online booking sites operate like any other e-commerce platform. Travel agencies buy rooms from hotels and sell 
them to customers, which are the travelers. As customer satisfaction is one of the main goals of the hospitality industry, 
it is vital to know the implications of what satisfies a traveler using an online booking site. Though studies on online 
booking sites are limited, the study would investigate this research gap. Thus, the research study aims to explore the 
importance of online booking and its implications on customer satisfaction and on the hospitality industry, particularly 
the hotel industry. To do this, the researcher assessed three online booking sites, mainly: Agoda, Booking, and Hotels. 
A questionnaire was conducted to survey 165 respondents who had experiences in online booking. Using the data 
from the survey, the three online booking sites and the survey data undergone assessment of their current systems, 
ANOVA test, Correlation analysis, Multiple Regression analysis, Risk assessment, and benchmarking. It was found 
out that the three online booking sites have their similarities and differences in the factors identified in the research 
study. These subfactors that are under hotel rental price, hotel rating, hotel location, e-service quality, and interface 
prove to be important.

1. Introduction 
The internet has become a predominant routine in our daily life. Most people spend their time browsing or using the 
internet in their activities. Because people spend time on this type of platform, activities that used to be done in the 
physical world are gradually integrated into the internet. Communication with people can now be done through social 
media, reading/watching news, which can now be done through blogs, and many more are examples of this. 
That said, companies immediately went with this trend as they started streamlining their businesses online; this gave 
birth to e-commerce. Electronic commerce or e-commerce has become an emerging industry. It was introduced around 
the 1960s with the first primitive electronic data transactions, and the first online transaction was done in 1994. Selling 
has become digitized, and everyone can purchase goods or products over the internet. In succeeding years, many 
businesses started adopting this marketing strategy to expand their accessibility to other consumers of other regions 
(Maday, 2021). 
 
Although there are many business niches, the hospitality industry can be applied to many companies that cater to the 
customer's needs, satisfaction, and leisure time. Those that serve food and beverage, travel and tourism, lodging, and 
recreation are the categories composing this industry (Novak, 2017). As innovations were introduced, the hospitality 
industry has always been the first to exploit technology (Smirnov, 2021). Such technology comprises the reservation 
system (SiteMinder Ltd, 2021), rating system (Premiere Theatres, 2017), and others like these are vital components 
towards quality improvement (Oh and Parks, 1996); this increased the urgency of finding solutions that would 
efficiently manage the business's online presence. 
 
The traditional way of reservation in hotels is the ones that use any offline source to get an inquiry. Such an offline 
source would be the use of a phone call. Hotel reservation centres receive calls from direct customers to inquire about 
room availability; this is tedious as the process tends to be complex and prone. Even though traditional methods of

672","Navigation is an essential subfactor in progressing on booking hotels online. Without it, no bookings would be made. 
As a practice, navigation should be easy to follow and efficiently directs the user to other prompts; this way, online 
booking sites would satisfy more customers locally and abroad and compete with other online booking sites 
internationally. Comparing Agoda, Booking, and Hotels together, there is a clear difference amongst the three. The 
difference was found to be between Agoda and Hotels. Agoda ranked the highest in terms of navigation. Respondents 
were generally satisfied with Agoda’s navigation, while the other two were somewhat okay. The website should be 
easy to learn, use, understand, and deal with to be the best online booking platform internationally. In this regard, 
there is a significant difference between Agoda, Booking, and Hotels regarding user-friendliness. The difference 
comes from Booking-Agoda and Hotels-Agoda since Agoda scored higher than the other two. Agoda was rated to be 
easier to understand, learn, and use than Booking and Hotels. The best practice for an online booking site is to have 
its web contents organized so that users would not have a hard time locating the essential functionalities of the website. 
It also aids in making the process of booking to be efficient. Moreover, there is a significant difference between Agoda, 
Booking, and Hotels. The difference was found to be between Agoda and Hotels. Agoda was rated organized since it 
uses button-sized filters and sectioning to categorize other contents. The website arranges importance based on 
placement from top to bottom of the page. The three online booking sites look distinctively different because of web 
design. One factor that makes online booking sites stand out is their overall aesthetics. Nowadays, everyone worldwide 
aims for minimalistic layouts, which are simplistic, appealing to the eyes, and consistent. For Agoda, its design is 
aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. For Booking, its design has a good contrast of colours. Hotels use a minimalistic 
approach in their interface, is aesthetically pleasing to the yes, and has great colours. Font sizes have a part in the 
aesthetic of the interface. According to the best practice applied in every country, Suitable font sizes are ones where 
the texts are visible, readable, and distinguishable from each other. From the ANOVA test and benchmarking, there 
is a significant difference among the three online booking sites. Notably, the difference came between Agoda and 
Hotels. Hotels were rated the lowest as respondents answered that they were readable at best; this suggests that Hotels 
increase their font sizes. Knowing the right font colour makes texts look readable and help in the aesthetics of systems. 
In interface design, it emphasized points, labels, and other important information. It is good practice to have font 
colours that contrast the background such that it is distinguishable from other elements of the webpage. There was a 
clear significant difference among the three online booking sites. Specifically, the differences were Hotels-Agoda and 
Booking-Agoda. Agoda was rated the highest in satisfaction as it effectively uses a wide range of font colours for 
indicating alerts, offers, descriptions, and many more. Booking and Hotels should benchmark their usage of font 
colours to Agoda's. Hotel images are one of the many essential features of an online booking site. It was used for 
previewing what the hotel and its other facilities look like at face value before deciding and booking it. Internationally, 
the best practice to maximize customer satisfaction is by providing high-quality hotel images; this means that images 
look professional, clear, and up to date. In this regard, respondents were satisfied with the hotel images quality 
provided by Agoda, Booking, and Hotels. No significant differences were found among the three online booking sites, 
as all of them were able to offer complete high-quality images of their facilities updated regularly. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, the researcher assessed the current systems of travel agencies. The researcher has concluded that all the 
sites have their difference in offers of hotel rental price, approach in reviewing and rating a hotel, map interface of a 
hotel location, approaches in their e-services, and designs of an interface. While there were differences, the similarities 
lie in the purpose of their functionalities. Ultimately, their goal was to get the best out of the online booking experience. 
For confirmation, the researcher performed various comparative tools and analyses. The SWOT Analysis found out 
that all the online booking sites have their differences in strengths and weaknesses. One of which is the reward systems 
they utilize for their customers. However, they have similarities in opportunities and threats. All the sites could 
improve their interface design, increase partnership, intense competition, especially in rental prices and travel 
restrictions. 
 
A total of 165 respondents participated in the survey. Most of them were middle-aged females who work in the health 
and wellness department; this also means that they have a stable job and monthly income, making them legible for the 
survey. Through observation, Filipinos seem to know about Agoda and Booking, but less about Hotels. Agoda also 
had the most respondents that reviewed its site than the other two, Hotels being the lowest. Most of the respondents 
reasoned that they use the website because it provides complete information and detail regarding the accommodations 
they are trying to find. Though most of them answered that they occasionally book online, respondents’ reason that it 
is due to the current pandemic faced when this study was conducted. Moreover, respondents discovered the online 
booking site they come to familiarize themselves with by their search, and others through an advertisement made by 
the travel agency.

680","Based on the ANOVA, there are significant differences in the online booking sites per identified factors. The factors 
that have significant differences were: performance rating, customer ratings and reviews, address information, 
transportation, transaction, cancellation, transaction convenience, responsiveness, navigation, user-friendliness, 
organization, design, font size, and font colour. Most of the significant differences come from the means difference 
between Agoda and Hotels, wherein Agoda had the highest mean and Hotels had the lowest mean. Thus, the statement 
that there was no significant difference in the online booking sites per identified factors must be rejected; this satisfies 
the study's first objective. 
 
Testing for the relationship between the variables was done using Pearson’s Correlation approach. Through the 
correlation analysis, it was found out that there are significant relationships between the variables or factors. All the 
factors that have a significant correlation have a weak to a strong relationship directly proportional to each other. It is 
important to note that three of the highest correlational values come from user-friendliness and navigation, payment 
option and payment convenience, and user-friendliness and organization, respectively. It can be said that satisfaction 
in user-friendliness is determined and dependent on the ease of navigation or the organization of the site, vice-versa 
for the other two factors. Payment options were also relative to the payment convenience since different payment 
methods ease use. Furthermore, the statement that there was no significant relationship between the online booking 
sites and their identified factors must be rejected; this satisfies the study's second objective. 
 
A regression analysis was also performed to see the subfactors that significantly affect overall customer satisfaction. 
Among all the subfactors, hotel image quality, customer ratings and reviews, and payment convenience significantly 
affect travelers’ overall satisfaction. Hotel image quality is the most impactful, and payment convenience is the least 
of the three. Three of the subfactors cover and explain 46.29% of the travelers’ overall satisfaction; this satisfies the 
third objective of the study. 
 
Since the online booking site is a service-based platform, more risks need to be identified and prevented in the e-
service quality provided. Through risk assessment, the mode of failures in hotel rental price, hotel rating, hotel 
location, e-service quality, and interface, preventive measures and contingency plans are determined to help improve 
or maintain the satisfaction of users of the online booking site. Although the effects of the failure may lead to 
customers' dissatisfaction, it could lead to customers using a different online booking site instead; this leaves a bad 
impression on the online booking site. Therefore, it is essential to identify solutions to these problems and have a 
contingency plan. 
 
To supply the risk assessment in finding solutions to problems, benchmarking between the three online booking sites 
was conducted to compare them. In summary, Agoda and Booking followed the best practices recommended for both 
local and international platforms. Hotels, however, fall short in some categories, such as the amount of partnership it 
has with hotels. The amount of collaboration it has with hotels in the Philippines may have contributed to it not being 
known to many Filipinos. Hotels need to improve in the fields stated in the benchmarking process. 
 
Due to the limitations of the researcher, Filipino Individuals in the Health and wellness type of work were the most 
respondents in this study. In future studies, it was recommended to widen the respondents' scope to international 
individuals who work in different kinds of the field; this is to validate the claims and results of this study. The focus 
of this study was three booking sites: Agoda, Booking, and Hotels. Adding different online booking sites were 
recommended to accurately assess the risks and benefits of an online booking site.

Abstract 
 
Online Food Delivery Services (FDS) have increased in popularity in the past few years. Timely delivery of food is 
crucial as it affects the quality of food and customer attitude towards the service. This study aims to address the orders 
that fail to deliver within the target lead time (breach orders) due to the non-optimal assignment of riders. This study 
proposes a method for determining the riders to assign per area from the demand through a simple forecasting tool. 
Current studies have already identified the factors that contribute to rider output. This study analyzes these factors to 
make a formula to calculate the rider output. In addition, the researchers will investigate the effect of new products 
and seasonal promotions on demand through a review and statistical analysis of historical data. This study contributes 
simple program that calculates the number of riders to assign based on user input.

1.Introduction 
The insurgence of Covid-19 cases in 2020 prompted a government response of implementing a nation-wide lockdown. 
The pandemic caused many businesses and restaurants to impose a closure to their physical stores due to the threat of 
transmission of Covid-19 and have opted to avail of third-party food delivery services. Food Delivery Service is a 
courier service in which independent stores and restaurants deliver food to their customers. Delivery can be through 
in-store delivery or through third party delivery. Food delivery services is still seen as a major trend in various 
demographic categories and continues to evolve in the means of providing the service. The annual growth rate (CAGR 
2020- 2024) of the Food delivery industry (platform - customers) is projected to a 7.0% increase which will reflect on 
a forecasted revenue of 51,514 (in million US dollars) for the year 2020 alone. (Li, Mirosa, & Bremer, 2020) 
 
A local Online Food Delivery Hub in the Philippines offers a variety of restaurants through a mobile app. The riders 
come from a third-party hiring company which can provide the labor force requirement as dictated by the company. 
The company established a Service Level Agreement (SLA) — the standard lead time for each process in the food 
delivery service. The process starts with Create to Preparing which involves the time it takes to process the order and 
establish the needed ingredients. Once the order is processed, the next activity is the Preparing to Ready wherein the 
stores will prepare the ingredients, cook the food, have the order packed, and ready for transit. The next activity Ready 
to In Transit is the time it takes for the order to be received by the rider. This ends with Delivery Rider to Customer 
Handover which is the total time between the arrival of the rider to the location and the customer receiving their order. 
 
The historical data shows that the number of breach orders have significantly increased during the month of June and 
July 2020 due to the strict policies during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. This remained consistent for the 
remaining 5 months of 2020 with an average of 54.6% still averaging at 52.50% in 2021. Breach orders are observed 
from all the stores affiliated with Company A during the first few months of 2021. The biggest contributor to which

6. Conclusion 
Given that the company utilizes a third-party hiring service for their riders, the best approach was found to be a 
forecasting tool to help in the workforce management. The main cause of the high percentage of breach was found to 
be the Ready to In Transit process which, according to related literature, is solved by having the right number of riders 
per area at a given time. The forecasting tool is able to output the number of riders to be assigned given the variables 
that any typical Food Delivery Service will be able to provide based on their respective situation and context. 
 
Demand and Rider Output was found to be the variables needed to identify the number of riders to be assigned per 
area. It was also found that the Regular and Seasonal Demand should be considered in forecasting the demand per 
area. This information provides a possible improvement to the way the company forecasts demand. This study has 
identified the variables affecting rider output relative to the distance from the store to the customer that will be used 
in the forecasting tool. 
 
It is recommended to use the demand of the current week separated into peak and non-peak hours for a specific area 
to be input into the program before the beginning of the next week to be used for optimal rider assignments in the area 
of next week. It is recommended to deseasonalize the demand before having its input in the forecasting tool. This will 
remove seasonal patterns in the time-series data to provide more or less regular demand data as the basis of the rider 
to be assigned per area. It is recommended to gather data on the average distance of a customer to the store as a 
deterministic approach.

Abstract 
 
Over the last few years, the poultry sector has positioned itself advantageously in the Peruvian market since it 
contributes 56% of the animal protein consumption demanded by the population. This represents annual sales of 
around 11,000 million soles, which corresponds to 29% of the agricultural GDP. Based on the above, companies in 
this sector must be at the forefront to satisfy the growing demand of this product and avoiding customer dissatisfaction, 
since this reduces the profitability indexes generating economic loses. Part of these considerations is to reduce the 
8.99% rate of order returns of a poultry company located in the south of Peru through a proposal that uses 5S tools 
and work standardization structured under the PDCA cycle. After the annual simulation of both models through the 
Arena software, the average error rate of the orders was reduced by 55.71%, the documentation search time by 44.04% 
and the order cycle time by 77.90%, all of them compared to their initial value. Resulting in a significant reduction to 
4.95% of the order return rate.

1. Introduction  
On a worldwide level, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (FAO, 2020), reported an 
increase in poultry meat production reaching up to 132 million tons in 2019. According to the Peruvian Poultry 
Association (APA) (APA, 2021), 56% of the protein consumed by the population comes from chicken meat.  This 
reveals the existing demand that poultry companies must satisfy in order to maintain an advantageous position in the 
market. The national poultry industry is important because it has an impact on the country's economic activity, 
representing 28.5% of the gross domestic production value of Peru's agricultural sector. However, statistical studies 
have shown a decrease in sales and an increase in returns in December 2020. This was due to the pandemic caused by 
Covid-19, which put many companies in jeopardy because of the impositions to operate and the new changes in demand 
and population consumption. (Inoñan y León, 2020). 
 
As can be appreciated, the problem lies in the increase in the rate of product returns. Not complying with customer 
specifications denotes deficiencies such as dissonance of information, disorganization in methods and inefficient 
processes within the organization (Hernández et al., 2018).  In this context, it is pertinent to investigate how to mitigate 
this problem by applying industrial solutions. 
 
A case study was chosen to reflect the problems faced by the poultry sector. In this sense, an improvement model was 
developed considering the implementation of Lean manufacturing tools in organizations. The 5S tools and work 
standardization were combined under the PDCA Cycle methodology to attack the described problem (Favela et 
al.,2019). Since the poultry sector is not frequently explored and few case studies are available, this study included 
successful cases that address similar problems related to the return of orders.

691",,"estimates to address the sales and dispatch area of this article. Indicators such as order error rate went from 10.16% to 
4.50%, documentation search time was reduced to 44.04% and order cycle time presented a reduction of 77.94%, both 
with respect to the current value. Finally, this proposal could be used as a reference for a preliminary guide in different 
sectors, but especially oriented to the poultry industry since the scarce information applied to these companies was 
one of the reasons that motivated this research. However, this should be evaluated according to the model of each 
industry so that they can adapt their objectives to the Lean Manufacturing tools.

Abstract 
 
This study discusses the Evaluation of the Construction Safety Management System (CSMS) based on The Ministry 
of Public Works and Housing (Kemen PUPR) Regulation No 10 of 2021 concerning Guidelines for CSMS and 
Instructions of Kemen PUPR No 2 of 2020 regarding the Protocol to Prevent the Spread of Corona Virus Disease 
2019 (COVID-19) in the Implementation of Construction Services on apartment construction projects to improve 
construction safety performance. CSMS is a new term introduced by Kemen PUPR Regulation No 10 of 2021 which 
is a new term to replace the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System where OHS Management 
System itself is already included in CSMS. Then due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a COVID-19 Prevention Protocol 
was compiled which refers to Instructions of Kemen PUPR No 2 of 2020 which was included as part of the CSMS so 
that in this study both were evaluated simultaneously. The purpose of this study was to find out how the process of 
implementing and evaluating the implementation of CSMS in apartment construction projects based on Instructions 
of Kemen PUPR 10 of 2021 and Instructions of Kemen PUPR No 02 of 2020 and provide recommendations for 
improvement and follow-up if the level of compliance in CSMS against existing regulations is still low. This research 
was conducted qualitatively that was designed descriptively. The results of this study are the level of compliance in 
CSMS based on existing regulations and provide recommendations for improvement and follow-up to improve 
construction safety performance.

1. Introduction 
The Indonesian Contractors Association is also known as AKI revealed that the construction sector in Indonesia 
experienced a slowdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and needed fast handling. According to the Head of the 
International Relations Section of AKI who is also the Director of Adhi Karya Partha Sarathi, with this pandemic 
condition the construction sector continues to carry out its activities, there are 90 projects of PT. Adhi Karya that still 
running normally and 17 projects have been postponed due to financing and conditions in the field (not because of 
covid). This was also reinforced by the explanation of the Director-General of Construction Development Trisasongko 
Widianto, that the Ministry of PUPR guarantees that all construction projects in the country will continue during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. With these conditions, the COVID-19 protocol absolutely must be implemented at the project 
site, to protect workers and their families from exposure to the COVID-19 virus (Fitriani, 2020).

Abstract  
 
This article is about how important an employees’ technostress are in affecting organization’s employee retention rate. 
Employees are one of the most and main important assets of an organization. Without employees, organization is 
unable to be formed or operate normally., organization plays an important role in affecting employees’ decision 
whether to stay or leave the organization. High employee retention rates mean that the specific organization can keep 
their employees to stay and work for long term. On the other hand, low employee retention rates tell us that the 
organization are unable to make their employees stay. This will bring a lot of bad effect such as increasing cost, losing 
experience employees, give doubt to potential investor and many more. Organization should reduce the technostress 
of employees to prevent them from leaving. Literacy facilitation, technical support provision, involvement facilitation 
and innovation support are some of the good treatments that will be able to make employees to stay.

1. Introduction  
The trend of using new ICTs in workplace has become unavoidable for most of the organizations. Advancement of 
technology has changed the social behaviour in the organization which affecting the individuals and groups of 
employees. The stress employees have been experiencing mostly caused by conditions or stress-creating factors in the 
organization. Technostress inhibitors are defined as situational variables in the environment of an organization, which 
are said useful in reducing technostress among employees. It also can potentially minimize the stress-creating factors. 
RED model which mentioned by Atanasoff & Venable (2017) is a comprehensive way for technostress which this 
model had considered the individual and contextual resources that cause worsening or use existing advantages. Based 
on RED model, the origin of technostress is coming from different aspect which beyond the individual. Social 
relationship and work productivity usually will be considered when the working environment discussed by the career 
experts. When the experts able to detect the client who face technostress, it is helpful to provide useful tools or 
information in order to make sure the problem can be evaluated. Thus, this approach able to determine the ICTs 
demand, organizational culture and ICTs resources (Atanasoff & Venable, 2017).

2014).  
As for the ANOVA regression analysis, it can be seen that the predictors or independent variables have significantly 
influence the dependent variable which is Technostress. To report the ANOVA regression analysis, the reporting is 
as follows: F(4, 222) = 17.157; p < .05.

From the above table, both models on Technostress in influencing employee’s Retention are also found to 
be statistically significant. In the first model,Technostress does influence employee’s retention where F(1, 225) = 
8.678 and  p < .05.  
  
8. Discussion 
 Many different kinds of treatments can be given  to reduce technostress and the first one would be flexibility. For 
salesman or Information Technology (IT) type of employees, it is recommended to give them flexibility such as does 
not need to go back to office every day. This is because they can do what they need to do even without staying at the 
office. By giving them this kind of freedom, they will be able to set schedules better and have some balance in their 
life. Also, lesser employees going back to office can reduce electrical bill, water bill, some facilities requirement and 
many more. Compensation, rewards, parties or recognitions should be included to maintain close relationship with the 
employees. This will allow employees to feel recognized and have good feelings toward the organization. 
 
In future, we hope that all the organizations around the world will realize how important employee retention rate is 
and treat their employees like their friends or family. This is really important as it will affect the organization reputation 
which might eventually cause bankrupt. Employees are normal human being too so they also deserve to get more and 
be happy. These is no such things like employees take the salary from the organization so they must work hard and 
deserve to work harder (Chandra,2021). They will feel stress, angry and sad which will then result in leaving the 
organization or worst case get sick because of it. Organization will then need to give them compassion which cause 
quite a lot of money. If the organization do not want to provide the money, then they might get sued or blacklisted by 
all other employees. Lesser employees will go to the organization which then cause the company or organization 
unable to be operated as how it supposed to. 
 
The pilot study supports the model proposed. This research can be carried forward to establish the effect of 
technostress towards the retention of employees

Abstract 
 
PT. EDS is a company engaged in archives management and provides technology products. Archives arrangement 
and digitalization project of PT. PP in 2020 conducted by PT. EDS has many disruptions due to COVID-19 pandemic 
such as holidays and activity restrictions. This resulted in the project implementation which was planned to be 
completed in the 18th week (October 2020), to be unfinished (project completion progress at 76.62%). The purpose 
of this study was to determine the performance of the project using the Earned Value analysis method. The data 
collected were project details, project planning S curves, budget plan, progress and costs project weekly reports. Then, 
the data is processed using the Earned Value method which is supported by Microsoft Project software to gets Status 
Report which is then analyzed for performance (time and cost) by describing the problems that arose during the 
research. The analysis result show that the actual implementation of the project is not in accordance with the project 
planning. The project was 5 weeks late compared to the plan, so the project costs was over budget (CPI of 0.77). The 
lowest CPI and SPI was in the 8th week and 13th week, while the highest CPI and SPI was in the 2nd week and 1st week. 
The solution to overcome similar problems in the future is to increase work effectiveness by using changing workday 
programs for low CPI problems and doing overtime or increasing resources such as workspace, laptop, scanner, and 
operator for low SPI problems.

1. Introduction  
According to (Abidin and Husin, 2018) digitalization of archives has been requesting frequently by many agencies or 
organization in recent decade due to advancement of digital technology. This project of achive management is as 
important as e-commerce, green building project, and many similar projects that aimed to be environmental friendly. 
In general, agencies or organizations that require archive management services are government agencies or private 
companies. PT. EDS is a company engaged in archive management and provides technology products. PT. EDS 
provides various solutions for the archive management needs of government and private organizations to create a 
modern administrative system that is implemented and supported by the latest technology. PT. EDS is used as the 
object of research because PT. EDS is an archive management service company that is growing and has a good 
reputation in several government agencies and state-owned companies. 
 
The implementation of the archive management service project is a series of activities that depend on each other, so 
it needs management, scheduling, and project control (project management) for the project to run and finish properly. 
Project management includes time, cost, and quality management so that projects can be carried out effectively and 
efficiently. If project management is not handled properly, various problems will arise such as delays in project

727","used to improve project work in the future is to make a work plan such as how to work and work targets in a more 
optimal pandemic condition, then provide training to workers on the work plan as a whole, then carry out control the 
performance of time and costs on a regular basis, and if there is a decrease in performance, the root cause of the 
problem is addressed as soon as possible and if this results in a delay in the work schedule, overtime may be carried 
out, add more human resources, or add more equipment so that the schedule does not get delayed. 
 
To solve specific problems such as low SPI (less than 1) on this project, the first solution that can be done is to do 
overtime. The intended overtime work is the staff implementing activities working beyond normal working hours in 
order to increase work output in order to achieve work targets. Overtime can be carried out on weekdays or holidays 
according to the agreement between the implementer and the project manager. This inline with previous research that 
overtime working time with more incentives could faster work speed (Sruthi and Aravindan, 2020; Gowan et al., 
2006). The second solution option is to add a work team consisting of a workspace (work desk), tools in the form of 
laptops and scanners, as well as HR (operators) which of course will increase project costs (laptop and scanner rental 
costs and operator salaries) ) so that further calculations are needed regarding the amount of overtime or additional 
work teams needed to improve SPI optimally. To solve specific problems such as the low CPI (a value of less than 1) 
in this project, then the solution is to do is improve the effectiveness of work. Arranged to get right schedule of the 
activities of the government and the client that can reduce the effectiveness of the work such as reduced working hours 
and so on before the day of implementation. So, if it is judged to be very ineffective to work at that time, the experts 
can apply the strategy work, one of which is the change work days so as to avoid the effectiveness of the work that is 
not optimal. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The actual implementation of the project is not in accordance with the project planning. The project experienced a 
delay of 5 weeks when compared to the plan (5th to 21st weeks have SPI < 1) , this also resulted in the actual project 
costs exceeding the budget (CPI 0.77 and CV -Rp57,052,400) due to costs such as employee salaries, equipment 
rental, and so on increase because the project lasts longer than planned. Overall, the project has an unsatisfactory 
performance when compared to the plan because the project has been delayed for 5 weeks and has a CPI value of 0.77 
(over cost). The lowest CPI (the most over cost) is in the 8th week with a value of 0.65 and the lowest SPI (the most 
behind schedule) is in the 13th week with a value of 0.59, while the highest CPI (the most under cost) is in the 2nd 
week. with a value of 1.22 and the highest SPI (most ahead of schedule) was in the 1st week with a value of 2.47. The 
solution that can be used to improve project work in the future is to increase work effectiveness , for example by 
implementing a workday change program at a time that is considered not optimal for low CPI problems (worth less 
than 1) and doing overtime (increasing working hours) or adding a team workspace consisting of a workspace (work 
desk), tools in the form of a laptop and scanner, as well as HR (operators) for low SPI problems (worth less than 1). 
 
This paper can be used as an evaluation to the company for project archives arrangement and digitalization in the 
future so it could run according to plan and have a good performance. In this paper there are no optimization regarding 
the amount of overtime or additional work teams needed to improve the SPI value, waste analysis, and have not taken 
into account the quality aspect, so this final project can be developed again regarding further amount calculations of 
overtime or additional work teams needed to improve the SPI value optimally, analyze the waste of archives 
arrangement and digitalization project in the pandemic era and other related topics.

Abstract  
 
Information technology has become an integral part of an organization. Information technology offers business 
processes that are more effective and efficient when compared to manual work handling. The apartment 
management is no exception. The number of residents in an apartment requires the manager to be able to carry 
out its business processes so that all stakeholders in the organization can be served properly. The Mobile-based 
Property Management application is one manifestation of the use of information technology in the management 
of middle-class apartments in the Jakarta area. The implementation of this application is intended to be able to 
provide services to apartment residents to be more effective and efficient. From the utilization of the 
implementation of the Mobile-based Property Management application, an analysis was carried out using the 
UTAUT method to see the impact of the implementation of the Mobile-based Property Management application 
on user acceptance and in the end could increase the satisfaction of application users, namely the residents and 
staff of the Apartment Manager/Building Management. The results analyzed in this study are Performance 
expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and Facilitating conditions for the implementation of Mobile-
based Property Management applications using the UTAUT framework. With the UTAUT method, it will be seen 
how much satisfaction level of application users are with the implementation of Mobile-based Property 
Management in middle-class apartments in Jakarta.

1. Introduction  
In the application of technology in the property industry, especially property management  (Fennelly and M. Perry, 
2017) practicality is needed in all respects. Including the implementation of the Mobile-based Property 
Management system. The application system for apartment management, especially for middle-class apartments, 
is intended to create convenience for residents and property management staff. The features contained in this 
application are divided into several roles, namely: the Occupant/Unit Owner role, the Tenant Relation role, the 
Engineering Department role, and the Building Manager role. This application is mobile based runs on Android 
smartphones. 
 
Mobile-based Property Management application is a concept about the use of Information Technology (IT), 
development, and characteristics for effective management of apartments. Mobile-based Property Management 
applications are considered a systematic procedure for collecting, maintaining, and utilizing data needed by 
organizations for the management of residents and existing facilities in an apartment (Krasnoyarova 2021),The 
features contained in this application are adjusted to the role per each part, for residents/unit owners there are 
features to be able to make complaints or submit requests, billing systems, payments, Apartment Circular 
Documents, and information on important numbers. The role of the Tenant Relations Division is to receive 
complaints from residents and send them to the Engineering section and in the end, can close tickets. This division 
can also view Circular Documents and information on important numbers. The Engineering Division has a role to 
be able to handle complaints and requests sent by the Tenant Relations Division, to handle Complaints and Requests 
until they are completed. The Building Manager can monitor all activities carried out by the Tenant Relations 
Division and the Engineering Division and obtain information in the form of an Executive Information System in 
the form of summary info of the entire process. All roles will get the feature of viewing Circular Documents and 
finding out important numbers that can be contacted when there is an urgent need. The apartment that is used as

Abstract 
 
Automobile sector started shifting its dependency from fossil fuel to electrical energy for the last few decades to 
mitigate the adverse environmental scenario like global warming, air pollution etc. Due to this, battery is emerging as 
the new source of power. At the same time, use of bikes for city transportation has been growing at a high rate in 
developed countries. For a heavily congested mega city like Dhaka, electric bikes can provide a better alternative to 
traditional fossil fuel vehicles. They are not only cost effective but also faster and can contribute to improved public 
health outcomes. With such background study, an initiative was taken to fabricate an electric bike. This paper presents 
a study of its chassis design and analysis. Triangulation was used as the basis of the design since this concept provides 
the best structural strength. Mechanical properties such as stress, strain and deformation at critical locations within 
the fabricated chassis was compared with numerical results obtained from the state-of-the-art FEA software ANSYS. 
The validated numerical method allowed to simulate the dynamic performance of the chassis by predicting the forces 
on the structural member during acceleration and braking. It is expected that the developed numerical methodology 
will allow to conduct exploratory designs with confidence.

1. Introduction 
The need for alternative fuel vehicles emerged in the 1960s and 1970s due to the increased pollution from internal 
combustion engines, rising prices, reliance on crude oil, and its diminishing supply. Since then, significant efforts 
have been made to develop workable electric vehicles to replace present IC engine vehicles. The key challenges that 
must be addressed to increase the vehicle's range, speed, and payload are weight reduction, analysis methodologies, 
fabrication processes, and optimization approaches. Topology optimization, based on the removal of conflicting 
constraints, design clearance, and material defects can be an effective approach for obtaining a lower weight vehicle 
with maximum performance.  
 
Chassis serves as the vehicle's skeleton, on which various components are mounted so that they can carry out their 
intended functions. The power-generating components (IC engine for a traditional fossil-fuel vehicle, batteries for an 
electric vehicle) are installed on the chassis in such a way that they remain protected during accident while also 
guaranteeing that their smooth operation is not hampered. The chassis accommodates the rider as well as provides 
hinge points for both front and rear suspension. It must be able to withstand a variety of forces and torques caused by 
bumping, braking and acceleration.  
 
Centralization and weight reduction of the chassis improve the vehicle's handling and performance. Under typical 
operating conditions, it is susceptible to dynamic forces transferred from the front and rear suspensions. During its 
service life, it will also be subjected to time-varying loads which can lead to fatigue failure. In the design and 
optimization of a motorcycle chassis, the weight must be minimized and centralized while factors such as strength, 
stiffness and durability should meet the design targets. 
 
An effective design is one that efficiently accomplishes the required task and is safe under extreme operating 
conditions. At the same time, it must be cost-effective in terms of the materials used and the manufacturing methods. 
For both failures and redundancies, analysis makes it easier to understand how a component will behave throughout

Figure 12. Factor of safety of the chassis 
 
Minimum factor of safety is 2.9317. Factor of safety is well above unity at all locations of the chassis and so the design 
can be considered safe and perfect during maximum braking to the front axle. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The number of automobiles on the roads throughout the globe is increasing at a staggering rate year by year, but the 
dependence on oil-based fuel grows almost unchecked. Due to this, electric vehicles come into the picture as an 
alternative. Need for an affordable and efficient mode of transport created a growing demand for electric motorcycles. 
This paper is taken as an opportunity, rather a challenge to design and develop the best in class electric motorcycle 
for the quotidian commute. One of the motivations of this paper was to make the chassis of the motorcycle more 
secure and more reliable so that it can negotiate all the driving conditions in the best possible manner. Much emphasis 
was put on making the motorcycle chassis as strong as possible to withstand crash and fatigue.

752","Dynamic features are important to predict the future behavior and so modal analysis was performed on the chassis. 
It’s vitally important to know the external forces as best as possible in order to calculate the internal forces acting 
on the chassis during maximum acceleration and maximum braking. Deformation and factor of safety of the chassis 
were determined taking all these forces into consideration.  
 
It’s highly desired that the motorcycle’s overall design and construction will increase its road performances and meet 
customer needs if made commercially available. All-in-all, this electric motorcycle can be an aspiring solution to a 
rather bigger problem than just being a day to day commuter. It can be a step towards an eco-friendly and sustainable 
mode of transportation.

Abstract 
 
Allied Health staffing has been a multi-decade challenge for many healthcare organizations and has become a crisis 
for nearly all healthcare organizations throughout the COVID-19 global pandemic. Mayo Clinic Health System in 
the Southwest Minnesota Region was not immune to these challenges. Recognition that staffing issues needed to be 
clearly defined, articulated, and planned served as a catalyst for developing and implementing a novel systematic 
approach coupled with process optimization using the staffing to workload tool. This revelation led to the present 
study, which explored establishing a centralized prospective staffing model for ambulatory clinics in the health 
system region. The study leveraged agile methods, widely utilized as a project management technique in the 
software development life cycle. Agile methodology has also been referred to as a mindset and principle where 
continuous feedback is incorporated on the product or service line being developed, along with the progress made, 
which was also an essential element of this study. Apart from establishing a staffing model, achievements made 
within this study included benchmarking well-established staffing related key metrics to national benchmarks, 
setting up a structure to manage staffing guidelines and standards centrally, an overview of key performance 
indicators and metrics as a region apart from siloed managing of resources by clinical sections and departments, and 
setting up processes to manage staffing and metrics of success on an ongoing basis. The work resulted in effective 
staffing to workload tool, allowing frontline leadership to identify and articulate staffing needs based upon 
outpatient visits and predictive capabilities in a practice or provider template change. Findings were well received by 
the key stakeholders, leadership constituencies, frontline leadership, and staff.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is ranked fourth with the largest population in the world according to the worldometer’s report in December 
2020, as the population in Indonesia increases the basic human needs in the form of housing also increase. Quoted 
from the Association of Indonesian Housing and Settlement Developers in 2021, the housing backlog reaches 8.2 
million with an increase in the backlog of around 500 thousand/year. To resolve that problem, The Ministry of Public 
Works and Housing Indonesia implements a program, namely the ""1000 Tower Project"" to build vertical housing in 
rental apartments. But in its implementation, several construction accidents were found. In this kind of rental apartment 
building construction project, architectural works on building construction have the highest number of work items 
compared to other types of work items, so further analysis is needed to mitigate construction accidents. The first step 
is to identify the list of architectural works, and then identify the potential hazards, risk factors, and controls so that 
goals and programs can be drawn up with plans for construction safety. The research method used is qualitative with 
secondary data or literature study. This research aims to arrange goals and programs for construction safety 
architectural works in a rental apartment construction project by identifying potential hazards and risk factors. 
According to the results based on the research question, there are 258 architectural work activities and 12 potential 
hazards and risk factors, of which there are 3 dominant potential hazards and risk factors, getting hit by falling/moving 
objects etc., inhalation/absorption of harmful substances into the body, through breathing/skin and vertical operator 
overload. By potential hazards and risk factors, specific goals and programs were made to prevent construction 
accidents with the right safety risk control for potential hazards and risk factors dominant.

1. Introduction  
Indonesia is ranked fourth with the largest population in the world. In 2021, the total population in Indonesia will be 
276,534,274 people or 3.51% of the world's total population. With the increase in population in Indonesia, housing 
needs have also increased. Quoted from the Association of Housing and Settlement Developers (Apersi) throughout 
Indonesia in 2021, the housing backlog reaches a value of 8.2 million with an increase in the backlog of around 500

In this study, we have identified work activities in architectural works in rental apartment building construction 
projects with 258 work activities including ceiling, wall, floor, door & windows, hardware, roof, and miscellaneous 
works.  Also from these work activities, we have identified 12 potential hazards and risk factors, of which there are 3 
dominant potential hazards and risk factors, getting hit by falling/moving objects etc., inhalation/absorption of harmful 
substances into the body, through breathing/skin and vertical operator overload. We can arrange specific goals and 
programs to prevent construction accidents with the right safety risk control for potential hazards and risk factors 
dominant. Therefore, the specific goals and programs include the use of PPE according to procedures, carrying out all 
work activities according to principles, conducting certified training for operators, and providing for health and safety 
needs. For future study, research can be done with different types of object research by types of construction projects 
to suggest possible future construction accidents.

Abstract 
 
The competition in the manufacturing industry continues to increase, along with the shifting demand of consumers 
who are increasingly aware of environmental sustainability. In order for companies to be able to profit and compete 
competitively but also pay attention to environmental factors, one of the most important things that needs to be done 
is to develop the concept of green supply chain management in business processes. GSCM is defined as 
environmentally friendly activities, which include green procurement, green manufacturing, green distribution, and 
reverse logistics. Green manufacturing is one of the most important concepts that must be considered by companies 
as a form of response to environmental issues. This study aims to analyze green manufacturing activities at one of 
brewery in Indonesia using the Green SCOR model. The result of the study shows that green activities in the brewery 
include management of clean water sources, energy savings, and waste minimization concepts such as reduce, reuse, 
and recycle. Based on the result of the study, it was determined that the company's performance measure in terms of 
green is 62.37. It means that the company's performance is included in Good category. However, 6 of the 17 KPIs 
need improvement. Improvements can be made by forming a manufacturing excellence team that will conduct an audit 
every 3 months.

1. Introduction 
The manufacturing industry faces the challenge of complying with strict environmental rules relative to the limitation 
or scarcity of natural resources, global warming, and waste management. Nowadays, awareness about environmental 
aspects has increased, and that has encouraged the industry to become a green industry by implementing the concept 
of Green Manufacturing (GM). Nevertheless, the company implementing green manufacturing was still very small.

Vehicle fuels derived from alternatives fuels is measure the number of forklifts in the factory that use diesel fuel. The 
Snorm value is 10.00 and still in the red category. The proposed improvement recommendation is give information to 
the top management about green energy in vehicles.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The objective of this research was to analyze green manufacturing activities at a brewery in Indonesia using the Green 
SCOR model. There are 17 KPIs that have been identified that are used to measure green manufacturing activities. 
Because each object has a different weight, the calculation of KPIs is done by normalization, namely Snorm de Boer 
normalization. After normalization, the data calculation of the achievement from KPIs is carried out by compiling 
KPIs based on the traffic light system. A traffic light is a method used to measure the activity of a performance. The 
measurement process is based on color indicators. There are green, yellow, and red. The result was determined that 4 
KPIs were in very good condition, 7 KPIs were in good condition, and 6 KPIs were in poor condition. The results of 
the study showed that the company's performance measure in terms of green was 62.37 that means the company's 
performance was included in the good category. However, from the 17 KPIs, there are 6 that need improvements. 
Improvements can be made by forming a manufacturing excellence team that will conduct an audit every 3 months. 
This research has both theoretical and practical contributions. On the other hand, the insights from the enabler factors 
indicate that the support and commitment from top management to implement the environmentally friendly production 
process is very necessary. Further research is highly recommended to further validate the outcomes of this study.

Abstract 
 
Surface Mount Technology (SMT) has been widely used in the electronic assembly industry's printed circuit board 
(PCB) assembly line. The assembly line consists of several stages, including solder paste printing, component 
placement, reflow, and inspection. Compared with other processes, component placement is a vital process. However, 
the placement machine in the component placement process is more expensive and is a bottleneck process in most 
cases. Therefore, properly utilizing the machine is crucial for optimizing the entire PCB assembly system. Due to the 
excessively high equipment configuration cost in the past, the combinatorial optimization problem of the different 
placement machines (including chip size, height, the accuracy) was less considered. As a result, the machine will be 
underutilized because the past combination mode cannot efficiently fulfill the placement requirements when demand 
or design changes. Nowadays, the placement machine towards modular design lets the configuration time be less time-
consuming than traditional. It only takes a few working days to complete the multi-line reconfiguration. Therefore, 
this research will consider multi-level capacity planning, referring to the domestic electronic assembly industry. 
Comprehensively provide a suitable machine combination according to market demand. Proposed a matheuristic 
methodology that product and component assignments are carried out through the mathematical model, and the 
heuristic algorithm quickly solve the large-scale machine combination problem. This research combines theory and 
practical applications, hoping to effectively improve PCB assembly lines to reduce idle waste, thereby enhancing the 
competitiveness of the electronic assembly industry.

Abstract  
 
The exponential population growth coupled with rapid industrialization and urbanization triggered enormous 
generation of municipal solid plastic waste (MSPW). The massive generation of MSPW, coupled with the poor 
management, have caused significant negative impacts on the environment. Recently, a variety of MSPW management 
measures, such as source separation and plastic reduction, have been developed worldwide to guide MSPW 
management systems towards sustainability. Hence, developing a sustainable MSPW management system, through 
the application of advanced waste measures, is important for future sustainable development. However, sustainable 
MSPW management systems have not been well addressed in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to develop a 
generic system dynamics (SD) model to study the sustainable MSPW management. This is achieved through 
forecasting the effects of sustainable measures, namely source separation policy, recycling process, and incineration 
with energy recovery technology on MSPW management and amount of GHG reduction. The proposed model is 
implemented on a case study of MSPW management system in Dubai to assess its applicability and effectiveness. 
Vensim® software is used to stimulate and analyze the model through testing five different scenarios. The simulation 
results indicated that scenarios HSLRWI and LSHRLI perform best in terms of the amount of plastic waste recycled, 
scenario LSWRHI leads to the highest amount of GHG reduction, and scenario LSHRLI gives the highest amount of 
incinerated plastic waste with energy recovery and least amount of plastic waste landfilled. Therefore, the proposed 
model helps decision makers in choosing the scenario that works best according to their strategies and goals.

1. Introduction 
Municipal solid waste (MSW), defined as wastes generated from residential, commercial, institutional, and municipal 
activities, has been considered as one of the most significant problems facing urban city in transitional and developing 
economies (Coffey and Coad 2010, Karak et al. 2012). The exponential population growth coupled with rapid 
industrialization and urbanization triggered enormous generation of MSW, including plastic waste (Ayomoh et al. 
2008).  
 
The favorable physical and chemical characteristics of plastics (e.g., flexibility, durability, resistance to erosion, ease 
of processing, lightweight) contribute to its utilization in several commercial and industrial applications (Evode et al. 
2021). In 2018, around 396 million tons of plastics were produced worldwide. This amount is expected to double in 
the following 20 years (Boyle and Örmeci 2020). However, the massive consumption of plastics, coupled with the 
poor waste management, have led to diverse environmental problems (Evode et al. 2021). Environmental pollution by 
plastic waste can contaminate and harm the terrestrial environment, which can be transferred to the aquatic 
environment, posing a serious threat to marine ecosystem (Alabi et al. 2019). In addition, the emission of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) during the decomposition of plastic wastes in landfills is also a major concern (Shams et al. 2021). 
 
Consequently, global efforts are now in force to guide MSW management systems, including municipal solid plastic 
waste (MSPW) management, towards sustainability. For instance, both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 
Global Waste Management Goals aim to reduce waste generation by 2030 through waste prevention, reduction, 
recycling, and reuse (Wilson and Velis 2015). Furthermore, various MSPW management measures and initiatives

792","100% compared to both scenarios, A and B. The extreme condition test clearly shows the consistency of the variables 
and how the relationship among them is coherent. Therefore, all the tests performed proved the structural validity of 
the proposed model. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Developing a sustainable MSPW management system, through the application of waste measures and policies, is 
important for future sustainable development. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impact of multiple sustainable 
waste measures and policies on MSPW management and GHG reduction amount. To achieve this goal, a generic SD 
model is developed by integrating three waste measures, namely source separation policy, recycling process, and 
incineration with energy recovery technology in the MSPW management system. Vensim® software is used to 
develop the proposed SD model. To test the impacts of these sustainable measures, five different scenarios are 
conducted taking into account different implementation levels for the three measures. The simulation results indicated 
that scenarios HSLRWI and LSHRLI perform best in terms of the amount of plastic waste recycled, scenario LSWRHI 
leads to the highest amount of GHG reduction, and scenario LSHRLI gives the highest amount of incinerated plastic 
waste with energy recovery and least amount of plastic waste landfilled. Therefore, the proposed model helps decision 
makers in choosing the scenario that works best according to their strategies and goals. 
 
For future studies, other waste management measures, such as plastic reduction policy, are planned to be tested. The 
economic impact of integrating sustainable waste measures and policies may also be studied in the future. In addition, 
it is anticipated to apply the proposed generic SD model to other cities to help them evaluate the impact of multiple 
measures and policies on their MSPW management.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays the metalworking sector is one of the most requested areas due to the exponential growth of industries 
dedicated to key manufacturing components related to metal products, such as mining, commerce, construction, 
furniture, office, and petrochemical, among others. Faced with a stricter demand and a highly competitive market, 
strategies are required to generate more agile and efficient processes in order to offer products with the required 
quality, but, as far as possible, at the lowest cost. This article presents the study and optimization of the punching 
process within a metalworking industry through the reduction of the times involved in the model changes of the: 
speaking bracket of Aristocrat – MARS Portrait Enclosure product.  The above with the application of techniques 
such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED), and Poka-Yoke; in a framework of 
administration and project management. The development of the previous methodological framework allows represent 
and analyze the flows of materials and information involved in the punching process through the SMED. On the other 
hand, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is used to design a plate that allows implement the SMED philosophy with the 
operators involved in the area. Subsequently, the plate is manufactured and defined as Poka-yoke for the forming 
dedicated tool to minimize errors in the operation of the process. Finally, this paper serves as an improvement project 
for the flex Company currently located in Mexico.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, the metalworking industry in Mexico has experienced exponential growth due to the rapid expansion 
of the metal transformation industry market by the most important trading partner, the United States of America. In 
addition, it increases with the need to have reliable and quality suppliers in the industrial field that manage to reach 
the necessary standards to meet the needs of a new demand in the manufacturing sector, which leads to the search 
for a hand of specialized and technically prepared that is currently in full development. 
 
For the country, the metalworking industry constitutes 17.6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to 
figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). According to figures from the Internet Tariff 
Information System (SIAVI), based on registered imports, Mexico annually receives just over 7,000 pieces of metal-
mechanic production equipment, to which higher levels of technology, innovation, and sophistication. Additionally, 
according to data from the National Chamber of the Iron and Steel Industry (Canacero), Mexico is the 14th steel 
producer in the world, it employs more than 700,000 people directly and indirectly and in 2018 alone, production was 
20.2 million tons of liquid steel. (American Magazine -industrial, 2021).

811","5. Results and Discussion  
This article had several results focused on the optimization of manufacturing processes, among which the following 
stand out: 
 
• 
The part  RIS-179105 SPEAKER PANEL model change was made more efficient. It was reduced the search 
and transferring time of the tools for the set from 50 to 37 minutes, which represents a 26% improvement. 
 
• 
The search for tools on the shelf has been eliminated, offering greater time flexibility to the technician to 
place the tools on the turret. 
 
• 
It was possible to eliminate 26 seconds of verification with vernier tools through the sample figures, reducing 
1.73 minutes (26 * 4) of the total 8 min of set up, leaving 6.27 minutes, which corresponds to 21.6% 
improvement. 
 
The foregoing contributes to the goal fulfillment of the project because the demand established by the client is now 
easily achievable and additionally, extra capacity was added to cover the needs of other clients, it is also worth 
noting that this study aligned to the resolution of the problems based on an engineering project management 
framework that will allow the flex company to implement new improvement proposals based on techniques 
supported by an accurate and efficient methodological framework. 
 
5.3 Future research 
As future work, it is intended to strengthen the validation of Poka-Yoke systems through the implementation of a 
study of times and movements that allows increasing the cutting capacity in the other projects, elaborating devices 
such as the one proposed in this study, designed specifically for the manufacture of the most complex parts in the 
different cabinets. On the other hand, additional activities will be reviewed within the VSM that can also be 
integrated into this or another improvement analysis in the punching cutting process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper demonstrates that analysis techniques in production processes are effective and that constant training in 
the area of research, and especially engineering project management, is a basic methodology in the industry, in 
addition to planning, The use of research techniques and training in assertive communication, these techniques today 
are an extremely indispensable tool, where the main objective is the delivery of reliable results that give certainty to 
the different challenges that companies currently face. 
 
For the metalworking industry, project management techniques represent a starting point for the analysis of new 
opportunity areas, where production processes can be studied with a reliable methodological framework, giving 
greater chances of success when implementing better engineering techniques.

Abstract 
 
The immerse growth of ride-hailing usage in Malaysia builds the need for decision makers to understand the 
potential factors that affect the adoption and application of ride-hailing services. Self-service technology is 
recognized as one of the most critical factors influencing the individual behaviour when using the apps. Ensuring 
security, functionality and enjoyment along ride-hailing services are also a fundamental challenge to all service 
providers. There are relatively small number of studies have examined this latent factor. This study aims to 
evaluate latent factor of self-service technology that affect the individual behaviour. Specifically, the self-service 
technology is taken from the Theory of Acceptance Model. A structured survey is conducted among ride-hailing 
users in Malaysia. With the use of structured survey for data collection purpose, 395 prospective respondents 
provided valuable responses. For sampling technique, the simple random sampling was used. The survey consisted 
of two parts; the first part contains respondent profile regarding on their gender, age, an experience on using apps. 
The second part was a major part of the questionnaire consisting of security, functionality and enjoyment 
measures. Research results suggest that the latent factor of self-service technology with its domain (security, 
functionality and enjoyment) are fit and reliable using the confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, this study verifies 
that the effectiveness of self-service technology factor could be used for further research on ride-hailing services.

1. Introduction 
The immerse growing of ride-hailing services provided by transportation network companies (TNCs) such as 
GrabCar, Uber, Big Blue Customer, Taxi Go, DOB, EZcab, Faszz, and Cioaz have profoundly influence mobility 
in Malaysia cities. The new additional modes have affected the utilization of other existing modes such as buses, 
trains, and taxis. To date, there are 31 companies were listed and approved by the Land Public Transport Agency 
(APAD) that customer usually use to book rides through mobile apps. As the rises of ride-hailing services in 
Malaysia, it is important to further develop an understanding of the potential factors that induce to travel demand. 
While many studies have aimed to examine the potential factors in ride hailing services but there is almost no 
research focus about the usefulness of mobile apps. Due to these facts, this study is aimed to identify the potential 
factor and examine their relationships toward Grabcar application. 
 
2. Literature Review 
The increase demand of ride-hailing services has resulted in an enormous publication that aims to understand the 
potential factors that influence the customers for keep using adopting these services. Despite the popularity and 
effectiveness of ride-hailing services, most of the studies are not focus on mobile apps. As a matter of facts, the 
authors have summarized the results and variable of interest from prior studies between year of 2016-2020 as 
depicted in Appendix I.

ABSTRACT 
 
The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that cause financial system instability. This study uses the 
Profitability Model which is represented by Return on Assets (ROA) as an indicator of Financial System 
Stability (FSS) as well as the dependent variable. As for the independent variables, this study uses the Capital 
Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Non-Performing Loans (NPL), Composite Stock Price Index (ISHG), and Assets. The 
data used in this study were cross-sectional variables between 2015-2019, which were processed using the 
Econometric Model of Panel Data Regression Analysis and Eviews 9.0. Research findings indicate that CAR 
and NPL have a significant influence on the creation of FSS through the profitability model. 
Keywords: financial system stability, non-performing loans, composite stock price index, assets 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The 1998 financial crisis was a valuable lesson in the importance of financial system stability (FSS) in 
Indonesia.In the case of Indonesia, the authority to stabilize the financial system is under the control of Bank 
Indonesia, namely through macroprudential regulation and supervision. The purpose of this stabilization is to 
prevent and reduce systemic risk, promote a balanced and quality intermediation function, and improve financial 
system efficiency and financial accessibility . 
Until now, there is no international agreement regarding the definition of FSS. However, so far, FSS is 
understood in a limited way by academics as a condition in which the financial system enters an unstable stage 
when the condition of the system can endanger and hinder economic activity. Financial system instability can be 
caused by many factors. This is generally a combination of the causes of market failure, either due to structural 
or behavioral factors. Market failure itself can be caused by external (international) and internal (domestic) 
factors.

833","profitability. The increasing incidence of poor bank asset quality requires attention to the elements that affect the 
profitability and management of bank assets. In the context of FSS, asset quality is a major predictor of 
bankruptcy and financial system instability. Therefore, high non-performing loans were found to be the main 
cause of failure of banking institutions. In addition, the problem of nonperforming assets (NPL) has become 
synonymous with the functional effectiveness of financial intermediaries and a major cause of economic 
problems(Rana, 2019).  
6. CONCLUSION 
The results of this study indicate that CAR and NPL have a significant influence on the creation of FSS through 
the profitability model. This finding further confirms the decision of the IMF and the Basel Committee to 
include these two indicators as a measure in assessing FSS. Given that CAR and NPL are important indicators in 
the creation of FSS, their implementation must be supported by a strict individual and macroprudential 
monitoring system by OJK and BI. Banks must be encouraged to continue to increase their level of capital, on 
the other hand, they must be monitored so that they have a low NPL. These two policy mixes are expected to 
maintain FSS in Indonesia.  FSS is actually something complex. As a system, the FSS does not only consist of 
banking, but also various other financial institutions. Therefore, further research is recommended to involve 
non-bank financial institutions either individually or jointly.

ABSTRACT 
This study aims to determine the effect of Corporate Governance and the Audit Committee on Corporate Tax 
Management. Corporate governance is the number of commissioners, the percentage of independent commissioners, 
and compensation for the commissioners and the board of directors. GAAP ETR ETR measures corporate tax 
management (Generally Accepted Accounting Principle Effective Tax Rate). The sample of this research is 
companies listed in the IDX30 Index period 2016-2020 using the purposing sampling method. The study's total 
sample was 55 companies that met the criteria as the sample of this study. The method of analysis of this research is 
using the multiple linear regression analysis methods. The results of this study indicate that the number of 
commissioners significantly affects corporate tax management. Meanwhile, the percentage of independent 
commissioners, compensation for the board of commissioners and directors, and the audit committee has no 
significant effect on corporate tax management.

1. Introduction 
Tax is one component of the many contributions in a country on a relatively large scale to support government 
revenues in financing the expenditure activities of a nation.  It can run its objectives to develop on a national scale in 
facilities and infrastructure in terms of quantity and quality of needs needed, exclusively in Indonesia (Damanik & 
Mu’id, 2019).

843","Following the research of (Minnick & Noga, 2010), which states that although compensation generally 
affects tax management effectively, the board of directors will improve performance in managing taxes by 
maximizing tax management in the company. This study is in line with (Armstrong et al., 2015) research, which 
states that increasing the amount of compensation to the board of commissioners and the board of directors is not an 
effective way to carry out tax management makes the company's tax burden smaller. The greater the compensation 
was given to the board of commissioners and directors, it will only make the board of commissioners and board of 
directors use compensation as a tool to enrich themselves and reduce the company's profits. 
(Deslandes et al., 2019) explains that an audit committee whose function is to improve the integrity and 
credibility of financial reporting cannot run well if there is no support from all elements from within the company. 
Based on these results, the audit committee indicated that its implementation was not supported by other factors, 
causing the audit committee to fail to carry out good supervision and tend to be neutral. (Hanum & Zulaikha, 2013) 
explain that the number of audit committee members in companies does not provide guarantees that they can 
intervene in determining the policy of the company's effective tax rate. In this case, it is following (Robinson et al., 
2012) which says that the selection and formation of the audit committee structure is the responsibility of the board 
of commissioners if the board of commissioners abuses the authority it has. The minimum arrangement or the 
increasing number of audit committees will further exacerbate tax avoidance related to tax management. This study 
aligns with (Damanik & Mu’id, 2019) that the audit committee is one factor that can provide direct supervision and 
a bridge in reporting from management to the owner. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of this study, total commissioners (COM) significantly influence the management of corporate 
tax (GAAP ETR). The percentage of independent commissioners (INDEP), compensation for the board of 
commissioners, the board of directors (COMP), audit committee (AC) has no significant effect on corporate tax 
management (GAAP ETR). The number of the board of commissioners (COM), the percentage of independent 
commissioners (INDEP), the compensation of the board of commissioners and the board of directors (COMP), and 
the audit committee (AC) simultaneously affect corporate tax management (GAAP ETR). Future research can use 
different methods such as Cash ETR. In this study, only the number of boards of commissioners, the percentage of 
independent commissioners, compensation of the board of commissioners, and the board of directors in the study 
corporate governance component. It is better to use broader corporate governance variables such as corporate social 
responsibility, institutional investors, audit quality, and others for further research. The study can examine other 
variables that affect corporate tax management, considering that the independent variables only explained 18.9% of 
the total in this study.

Abstract  
 
Problems in the design and engineering phase of state buildings, especially the ATC Tower construction project and 
supporting facilities, are recurring phenomena that need more attention in the project development phase. Some of the 
problems are flaws in the Detailed Engineering Design (DED) documents, discrepancies between DED documents 
(Drawings, Engineer’s Estimate, BOQ, and Work Plan & Terms), and late completion of design and engineering 
works. These problems can have an impact on the implementation of construction, such as rework which results in 
additional time and costs. Several problems in the design and engineering of the ATC Tower Building and supporting 
facilities indicate that the design and engineering phase is not running effectively and efficiently. To realize an efficient 
and effective design and engineering stage, it is necessary to standardize operational procedures or an efficient and 
effective design and engineering work system. This research aims to develop a standard operating procedure regarding 
the design and engineering works of the ATC Tower Building and supporting facilities.  
 
The product of this study is a Risk-Based SOP for the design and engineering phase of the ATC Tower and supporting 
facilities construction project which can improve efficiency and effectiveness in the related works. The Risk-Based 
Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) is developed by adding risk response activities that are obtained from the risk 
analysis stage in this research. Methods used in this research are archive analysis/literature study, questionnaire survey, 
and Delphi’s method. The results of this study indicate that there are 4 business processes in the design and engineering 
phase of the ATC Tower and supporting facilities construction project, namely the Conceptual Stage, Pre-Engineering 
Plan Stage, Design Development Stage, and Detailed Design Stage. There are also a total of 93 potential risks that 
may occur in the design and engineering phase of the ATC Tower and supporting facilities construction project with 
29 risk factors categorized as high risk.

In this study, the development of risk-based SOPs is carried out based on the addition of risk response activities 
obtained from the analysis results. The additional activities are derived from the selected Preventive and Corrective 
Actions. These risk response activities are added to the SOP to prevent or minimize the occurrence of risks in the 
activity. Table 7 below is the example of the development of SOP in the detailed design stage of the design and 
engineering work of the ATC Tower and its supporting facilities construction project that is already risk-based (New 
activities originating from risk response analysis are marked in red) (Table 7).

Abstract 
 
In line with global trends, self-employment in Malaysian has shown an upward pattern and this is due to the 
preferred choice of employment among Malaysian millennials and Gen Z those born in the mid-1990s onwards. 
As exciting as this development is, Malaysians who are self-employed often neglect something everyone should 
do the moment they start working: saving for retirement. In Malaysia, the social protection system is only 
mandatory participated for those employed either in the public or private sector which basically covered by the 
government pensions scheme the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). The basic principle of this system is to 
provide protection against poverty, financial assistance, and future guarantees for the elderly, at the same time 
reducing the old-aged poverty and dependency on government assistance. However, no such structured social 
protection system was introduced to the informal sector workforce in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aims to 
determine the important factors to develop micro-pension model for self-employed in Malaysia. With the 
summary of the relevant literatures, the study has concluded several critical success factors in developing micro-
pension scheme which include, demographic, awareness on importance of retirement savings, platform system to 
access the scheme, incentives or additional benefit for the micro-pension scheme and payment amount or 
contribution for the scheme. All in all, the development of the micro-pension model helps to provide a proper 
channel for the informal sector people, especially low-income earners B40 to save for their retirement. It is 
believed that the implementation of such a model will directly increase the level of financial literacy among them. 
Thus, reducing the old-aged poverty and the number of elderly people who depend on the provisions of the 
Department of Social Welfare (JKM) programs.

Abstract 
 
Design and build contract practices in Indonesia, especially in stadium construction project, has been arising so many 
disputes recently. These disputes occurred because there were many differences during the post-project audit phase 
between the Audit Board of Indonesia (BPK) and the contractor as the construction service provider. It occurred 
because initial total cost estimated for the project was low on its accuracy compared to project actual cost. The non-
existence of a standardized cost planning and set of specifications following it are the issues that researcher has been 
focusing on, especially on mechanical and electrical work matters since it consists of most work items of the whole 
project. The project cost has to be divided into three main categories that are standard cost, non-standard cost and 
other cost, therefore, fractionated based on its area of working to get each percentage. It developed based on literature 
review from several regulations existed and from various past projects’ bill of quantity and detailed engineering 
design. Furthermore, SPSS and Monte Carlo method has been used to find its cost per meter square and cost per seat. 
In order to find the mathematical model to improve cost accuracy, SPSS and structural equation modelling have been 
used to test each variables’ indicators which raw data given by respondents’ questionnaires and it found that the three 
independent variables are all significantly positive toward the cost accuracy. This developed set of standards therefore 
taken into some experts to be validated.

Abstract 
 
The sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations as a reference for global development can 
be an objective development indicator for countries, cities, including villages because they contain 17 goals with a 
vast spectrum and indicators. The SDGs framework of balancing social, economic, and environmental elements could 
guide the village's medium-term development to achieve its goal of sustainability, especially when in Indonesia, the 
government has given each village autonomy for its development with a direct budget to manage. This situation 
demands more responsibility for village governments to be able to achieve ideal and sustainable development. 
However, the national authority cannot be hand-out after giving the village funds by observing the complex problem 
of the village's development. This framework should be translated into a development model that the village 
government, higher district/city officials, or the experts can use to guide the village's medium-term planning. The 
model should prevent subjectivity and the wrong focus on the development priorities set by the village government. 
The model could also reduce the pressure from district/city development planning programs that can be inconsistent 
with village needs. This research aims to identify the focused gap by comparing current conditions with the ideal 
development framework using a systematic framework based on Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). The gaps found 
would be resumed as recommendations and output of this research. It would enable relevant stakeholders to 
collectively discuss the goals and priorities for each village to achieve more sustainable development.

1. Introduction 
Campaigns on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been popular in the past decade and many governments 
in each country are implementing the goals of the SDGs into a strategic plan for national development planning. SDGs 
were to be a grand design for global development planning by changing the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) 
in 2000 (Sachs 2012). At this point, SDGs have been criticized by Janoušková et al. (2018) that implementation was 
difficult in several nations that have complex problems including social, economic, and environmental, and also need 
government concert to follow SGDs targets and indicators. Therefore, a county with very complex and heterogeneous 
current conditions needs more effort to achieve SDGs compared to some nations with homogeneous conditions such 
as Indonesia. In Indonesia, rural and urban areas are too many polarities in economic, social, and development issues. 
This situation makes the Indonesia Government develop a regulation for village autonomy by Law No.6 / 2014 
concerning the village that gives the village special authority to manage village funds given together with village 
autonomy for their affairs (Aziz 2016). 
 
Village development planning is implemented by designing the Village Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP) 
for the next 6 years of Village Governance. This document form from a discussion between the village government 
and the villagers/representative named ‘Village MTDP Development Plan Forum’ (called musrenbang in Indonesia) 
to describe village problems and which problems need to be solved first by defining the priority list (Ariadi 2019). 
However, the head of the village is elected by the democratic political system by-election, and the election brings a 
problem for the village government policy. Aziz (2016) explains that the villagers' participation in the village 
development plan forum comes as a political tool that is probably formed by the village election system and the village 
development plan probably goes unobjective and unsustainable. In this case, the head of the village has the

6. Conclusion 
The implementation of sustainable development in almost all countries has started with the SDGs as a frame of 
reference campaigned by the United Nations. In Indonesia, it requires more attention from actors/ stakeholders in 
village affairs and development planning, there are the Ministry of Village-DDRT and the Ministry of National 
Development Planning. These gaps are found in this study because the differences in the quality of development in 
Indonesia are quite far between urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The problem of development in the village occurs 
because the average villager thinks in short-term development planning, the potential for development inconsistencies 
with changes in regional development planning, and the national SDGs are complicated to implement at the village 
level. The SDGs can be an ideal development framework from the national to the village level as long as the 
Government of Indonesia builds a sustainable development framework at the village level and synergizes with local 
governments. Then, the existence of indicators that are easy to measure by the Village Government can be a reference 
in building the Village MTDP.

Abstract 
 
DKI Jakarta is an urban area with a high population density during working hours, reached 219 people/ha in 2017. 
This population density encouraged change in green open space to be roads and high-rise buildings, as well as 
increased exhaust emissions from motorized vehicles. As a result, urban heat island phenomenon has emerged in 
several locations such as the Jagorawi Toll Road, Cempaka Putih, and Kemayoran. Efforts have been made to reduce 
and mitigate these impacts by implementing vertical greening system at the flyover structure in DKI Jakarta. However, 
the temperature in DKI Jakarta continued to rise reaching >41˚C in 2019 as the highest record. The continuous 
increase in temperature proved that the implementation has not been maximized. This study was conducted for the 
purpose of identifying the benefits and challenges of the application of vertical greening system at the flyover structure 
and analyzed existing condition of the implemented vertical greening system at the flyover structure in DKI Jakarta. 
The method used to achieve those purposes was survey by questionnaire and interview, conducted to the provincial 
government of DKI Jakarta and vertical greening system contractors. The results of this study pointed that the 
government and contractors most agree on the aesthetic benefits from the social aspect and the challenges of the initial 
investment from the cost aspect. The implementation of a vertical greening system at the flyover structure has been 
carried out in 14 different locations with the majority of the systems implemented were living walls.

1. Introduction 
DKI Jakarta is an urban area with an area of 66.233 ha (Governor of DKI Jakarta Province 2007) and had a population 
of 14.5 million in working hours (DKI Jakarta Provincial Government 2017 in Hidayati 2019), so the population 
density reached 219 people/ha. Therefore, according to SNI 03-1733-2004 (National Standards Agency 2004), DKI 
Jakarta is an area with a high population density during working hours. 
 
The high concentration of population caused gradual changes in green open spaces into high-rise buildings and roads 
(Elgizawy 2016). These changes occurred in DKI Jakarta along with an increased greenhouse gas emissions from 
motorized vehicles, where the average CO2 emission was 6955.12 thousand tons from 2010 to 2017 (DKI Jakarta 
Provincial Environmental Agency 2018). As a result, an urban heat island phenomenon appeared and created 
microclimate changes where the temperature in the city was very high and increases dramatically to the city center, 
densely populated areas and industrial areas (Bahi et al. 2016). The urban heat island effect occurred in several 
locations in DKI Jakarta such as around Tanjung Priok, Jagorawi Toll Road, Cempaka Putih, Kemayoran, Jatinegara, 
Gatot Subroto, Duren Sawit, and so on (Prasasti et al. 2015). 
 
Efforts to improve the local microclimate and mitigate the intensity of the urban heat island phenomenon could be 
carried out through the implementation of vertical greening system (Afshari 2017). The vertical greening system was 
considered as one of the most viable greening options because it did not require additional space and easily integrated 
into new or existing construction (Feitosa and Wilkinson 2018). In DKI Jakarta, the implementation of vertical 
greening system to deal with the urban heat island phenomenon has begun and has been implemented to flyover 
structures in several locations, such as Kalibata and Karet. Generally, the implementation of vertical greening systems 
was hindered by factors of cost, maintenance, sustainability, complexity, and vulnerability (Bustami et al. 2018, Riley

Abstract 
 
The widespread availability of the Internet has surely altered how business is conducted. The journey from jobs to 
entrepreneurship is growing easier with continually expanding technology, business models, and increasingly 
imaginative advertising advances on social media. This research aims to identify research trends and visualization 
mapping on the issue of Digital Entrepreneurship using bibliometric analysis. The Scopus database was used to 
collect data for this study, and bibliometric network mapping was demonstrated online using the Scopus website and 
VOSViewer. We employ an article selection approach that begins with the searched keywords and year constraints 
and ends with the database being exported to RIS and CSV format files. We retrieved 1659 scientific publications 
from the Scopus database in the last ten years, from 2012 to 2021. VOSViewer is also used to map the network. 
According to the database the most knowledge is in the field of “Business, Management and Accounting”, with 
25.2% academic documents (N=584). Then the second is “Social Sciences” with 444 academic documents, and the 
third is Computer Science with 15% academic documents (N=347). Data study demonstrates a considerable growth 
in producing scientific articles on Digital Entrepreneurship worldwide from 2012 to 2021. This study suggests 
merging numerous Digital Entrepreneurship research themes, abbreviated as the LADESO research theme: 
Literature, Adoption, Digital Economy, Student, and Outcome.

Abstract 
 
One of the strategic projects implemented by the Directorate General of Railways, Ministry of Transportation of the 
Republic of Indonesia is the Double-Double Track Development Project (Package A) from Manggarai to Jatinegara. 
This project is divided into two phases and has experienced several extensions of the implementation time which has 
resulted in delays in the project completion schedule. Delays in completion schedule will certainly have an impact on 
a number of things, both in terms of project financing, assessment of the performance of institutions / ministries, 
achievements felt directly by the community, can even lead to changes in the pattern of railway operations as a form 
of adjustment to the development process. This paper was created to identify risk factors that causing delays in the 
completion schedule in the case study of the Double-Double Track Development Project (Package A) from Manggarai 
to Jatinegara. The research process is carried out by making a questionnaire addressed to the respondents, by first 
validating every risk variable by the experts. The questionnaire consists of two main parts; risk impact intensity 
assessment and risk probability assessment. The results of the assessment by the respondents were then processed so 
that valid risk factors were obtained as an answer to the causes of delays in the completion schedule of the project 
case study. By identifying risk factors that have a potential to occur, it is hoped that there will be improvements in 
project implementation, especially in the preparation of schedules and processes for controlling and mitigating risks.

1. Introduction 
In the last 10 years, the construction of railway facilities in various parts of the country has been carried out by the 
Ministry of Transportation through the Directorate General of Railways (Ministry of Transportation, 2020). Some of 
the manifestations of this development include the construction of new stations, modernization of stations and railway 
facilities, construction of double track and Double-Double Track lines, construction of viaducts, and so on. In carrying

6. Conclusion 
Study shows that the risk factors “Change in Scope of Work/Review Design” and “Coordination with Stakeholders” 
are risk factors that are very influential and often occur in Double-Double Track Development Projects (Package A). 
Both of these risk factors need to be followed up on their handling (against the conditions of the work that is currently 
running), as well as a preventive action plan for the future, so that what happens in this project can be a lesson for the 
implementation of subsequent projects. 
 
The results of this study also show that the identification carried out is very relevant to what has happened so far in 
the Double-Double Track Development Project (Package A). The validation process by experts who are also directly 
involved (or have been involved) in this project is also very in line with what actually happened, so it can be concluded 
that the process of identifying risk factors causing delays in the completion schedule of the Double-Double Track 
Development Project (Package A) through this research went well and in accordance with the conditions of the project.

Abstract 
 
Since its inception, the concept of a digital twin has been used in a broad range of fields, including product life cycle 
management, product development, manufacturing, logistics, and process control, to mention a few. As technology 
advances, physical objects and virtual worlds are being integrated and interconnected in a real-life context. 
However, the Supply Chain Digital Twin publishing is confined to a few topics. This study uses bibliometric 
analysis to graphically map scientific publications and research trends in the Digital Twin Supply Chain sector 
worldwide. The Scopus database was used to collect information for this study, and online analysis using the Scopus 
website and VOSViewer was used to demonstrate bibliometric network mapping. We use an article selection 
procedure starting with the searched keywords and year constraints and then exporting the database to RIS and CSV 
format files. We retrieved 179 scientific publications published between 2017 and 2021 from the Scopus database 
over the last five years. We also use VOSViewer to map the network. According to the database, researchers in 
Germany had the most published papers indexed by Scopus among the most prolific authors (N=30), with the 
United States coming second (N=27) and the United Kingdom third (N=16). This study recommends combining the 
research subjects of IoT for Sustainability in Agriculture: Digital Twin Concept, Impact, Disruption, Internet, 
abbreviated as DTCIDI research themes.

Abstract 
 
Reducing process lead time is one of the manufacturing industries' challenges to boost productivity and minimize 
the time required to develop new products. One of the processes that may improve further during new product 
development is the Failure Analysis Process. It is finding the root cause of a failure to address the issue and prevent 
future failures. The Failure Analysis Process of Company-ABC, a hard-disk drive manufacturer, was evaluated in this 
study to optimize the process and reduce investigation lead time by fifty percent. A shorter investigation lead time 
benefits the company since it enables faster discovery and correction of errors, hence expediting the development of 
new products. Process improvement can be achieved in various ways, one of which is by applying ECRS concepts 
(Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, and Simplify), which involves eliminating insignificant activities, combining or 
rearranging the order of related activities, and simplification of activities. The VA/NVA (Value Added and Non-Value 
Added) and 5M1E (Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement, Environment) analysis can help determine which 
tasks have opportunities for improvement and optimization through ECRS. Company-ABC was able to halve the 
duration of the investigation by utilizing the ECRS concepts. All activities that underwent ECRS were discussed with 
the process's team members to ensure that all potential effects were understood before implementation. Finally, issues 
that develop due to process optimization will be monitored and documented constantly to help pinpoint specific areas 
in need of further improvement.

1. Introduction 
Company-ABC manufactures a broad range of innovative hard disk drive (HDD) devices to meet the demand of the 
global storage market. HDD is one of the critical devices and the most vital personal computer component, according 
to (David and Hennessy 2005). Since HDDs are mechanical devices, these will all ultimately fail. While some may

930","tact time and line efficiency before and after the application of ECRS concepts. In this study, the expected result is a 
50% lead time reduction for a process that involves “service.” Here, the result is highlighted by comparing tact time 
before and after applying ECRS concepts. This study does not have line efficiency verification since the process does 
not involve manufacturing of products. The totality of each member's completed investigation samples can be used to 
evaluate the ECRS's efficiency, however it may not be reliable due to variations in the number of failures or 
investigation requests. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the result of the VA/NVA and 5M1E analysis, and the impact of the ECRS concepts on the process, it can 
be concluded that under the new process flow, the Failure Analysis Engineering Group of the Product Design Support 
Department of Company-ABC improved its investigation lead time and met the target of fifty percent reduction. With 
process improvement, the new lead time for the investigation was reduced to 529 minutes with nineteen steps. The 
significant improvement is primarily due to the simplification concept of ECRS, which led to the development of an 
excel macro to automate the manual log data analysis and script creation steps. These process improvements also 
eased and lessened the members' fatigue since the repetitive activity was simplified. It would be helpful for future 
research if processes associated with the FA group, such as Teardown Group, were also subjected to the same study 
since this would expedite the analysis and correction of failures encountered during new product development.

Abstract 
 
Pigment dispersion process is the most crucial process in printing ink manufacturing. A multinational printing ink 
manufacturing company produces ink through semi-finished or intermediate products prior to finished ink production. 
Pigment concentrated is an intermediate with the most complex manufacturing process in the company because it 
involves a pigment dispersion process. During the 2019-2021 period, the Right First-Time rate of pigment 
concentrated was below than 70%. Along with technological developments, the use of Data Mining methods in the 
industrial world has been widely studied. The objective of this study is to classify printing ink quality based on the 
pigment dispersion process by bead mill with CART using historical production parameter and quality data from a 
multinational printing ink manufacturer. This research was conducted using the QM-CRISP-DM framework by 
Schafer et al. (2018). The data was obtained from the production logbook and the company's ERP database from 2019 
to 2021 period. The model was made using 18 independent variables and particle fineness status as target variable 
with (0) as defected and (1) as not defected. This study shows that the fineness of printing ink is highly affected by 
temperature of Pass 1 during the production. The decision rule to reduce defect in pigment concentrated production 
process is also proposed. The use of the over-sampling method on training data and the Entropy Criteria has the highest 
accuracy.

1. Introduction  
Food, beverages, household goods, electronic products from daily essentials are generally sold in a package. The 
packaging is made of various types of materials, such as plastic film, paper, and aluminum foil. The various types of 
designs consist of various colors on these packages. Singh (2006) stated that the color on the packaging is one of the 
important aspects that have an influence on the perception of customers when buying a product. Inconsistent colors 
between packages of the same brand can damage the brand's image and have an impact on product sales. The printing 
ink industry for packaging actually plays an important role in realizing design ideas on packaging with the desired 
material. 
 
In general, color on the packaging comes from the coloring agent in the printing ink. Coloring agents that are widely 
used for printing ink applications on packaging are pigments. The pigments mixed in the printing ink form a colloidal 
system known as dispersion. The level of pigment dispersion in a printing ink depends on the particle size distribution 
of the pigment in the printing ink. Pigments, especially organic pigments, need to go through a grinding process to 
reduce their particle size so that they can be well dispersed in the polymer resin ink system and produce strong, clean 
color shade, with high gloss levels (Mäntynen et al., 2012). In the printing ink manufacturing process, pigment 
agglomerates are reduced through collisions between beads in a bead mill so that the particle size is reduced to 
aggregates. The grinding process is carried out continuously until finally the pigment particles reach a size of less than 
5 µm. The particle size of the pigment is crushed through a cycle of collisions of the bead in a bead mill.  
 
A multinational printing ink company produces ink through an intermediate phase. One of the intermediates produced 
is pigment concentrated. Pigment concentrated are semi-finished inks that only consist of resin and single pigment. It

6. Conclusion  
The pigment concentrated quality is crucial for printing ink quality because it provides color for print-ready ink. 
However, the pigment concentrated production process is often challenging because of many factors involved. The 
objective of this research is to construct model and analyzed process parameter with lowest defect rate with Decision 
Tree. CART was used as decision tree algorithm. SMOTE was used to balance the data and the best parameter was 
determined by means of GridSearchCV in order to obtain high accuracy. The model with sophisticating accuracy was 
constructed parameter as follow, Entropy as splitting criterion, minimum sample per leaf is 2, and maximum tree depth 
is 7. Temperature during Pass 1 became the most important feature in this model which stand as root node in decision 
tree visualization. From material quality aspect, varnish with higher solid content and lower viscosity is more desired 
to achieve lower defect rate. QM-CRISP-DM was helpful to solve printing ink industrial problem using Data Mining 
approach. For future work, the methodology in this research can be proposed to improve products that was produced 
using vertical bead mill and widen for the other pigment concentrated with different color index. Each pigment has its 
own characteristic and this model could be not applicable for the other pigments. Therefore, new model development 
is necessary to improve the other product quality

To provide an exceptional product or service to the consumer on time, a production and regular quality control process 
are essential to avoid errors that could compromise the timeliness and quality of an entire batch. This is where the 
human aspect intervenes in relation to the machine, to ensure that all parameters are respected. And with such 
industrial development of the new generation that is aimed to facilitate even more the task of production and quality 
control. The role of the operator and the inspector is to define, scan and visually search the process in progress, so at 
the end decide to accept or reject the product / service. The decision making depends initially on human reliability in 
performing this task with a significant error rate. Human error is an inappropriate reaction that leads to anomalies and 
defects in the organization, it is considered a major factor in reliability and the cause of loss of human performance. 
Several factors influence human reliability and lead to errors, and by the same effect they generate human cognitive 
behavior. The cognitive-behavioral approach aims to help operators to cope with the external environment and to 
better integrate into industrial environments of any kind. In this regard, we study human cognitive behavior in order 
to better understand its features, weaknesses and potentials. With this neuropsychological knowledge, we propose the 
best methodologies to optimize the performance of human reliability and achieve the required productive and 
qualitative aspect.

Abstract 
 
In the occurrence of a pandemic, limitations on human movement have a negative influence on construction 
productivity, and if the epidemic persists, construction firm performance will inevitably fall. This paper discusses the 
performance measurement of construction company using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the influence of 
the Covid-19 outbreak on the performance of public listed construction company in Indonesia. The objective is to 
assess construction company efficiency and compare their performance to other comparable companies before and 
throughout the pandemic. Non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) was utilized to focus on sales and market 
value as output measures in a two-step DEA approach with different input and output configurations. This paper 
examines eighteen significant construction companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, with two types of 
ownership, private companies, and state-owned companies. According to the findings of the study, the pandemic 
condition did not significantly affect the decline in the performance of the construction company. Where construction 
companies can survive with their abilities, and still maintain their performance. Our findings suggest that company 
efficiency plays an important role in evaluating company performance and that efficient companies can serve as a role 
model for company performance improvement strategies, such as when the economy is disrupted by the current 
pandemic

1. Introduction 
Performance is an important way to gauge a company's success. The main company's objective is to maximize profit 
by utilizing the resources (inputs) available to achieve the highest potential output. When evaluating performance, 
measuring efficiency can help determine whether the result produced is best in terms of resource usage. Many studies 
have been undertaken to determine performance appraisal by measuring the level of efficiency. Several countries, 
namely Canada (Pilateris & McCabe, 2003), South Korea (You & Zi, 2007), China (Xue et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 
2011), Portugal (Horta et al., 2010; Horta & Camanho, 2014), Greece (Tsolas, 2011, 2013), Iran (Peng Wong et al., 
2012), and Spain (Kapelko et al., 2014; Kapelko & Oude Lansink, 2015), have used efficiency levels to assess the 
performance of construction companies. This is due to the importance of construction companies in the construction 
industry.  
 
The construction industry is the main economic pillar in many countries, which contributes greatly to GDP and 
employment rate (Wang et al., 2021). The importance of the construction industry in the economy of both developed 
and developing countries has increased in recent years (Horta & Camanho, 2014). Based on Badan Pusat Statistik 
(2020) data, in the last 5 years (2015-2019) the construction sector was able to contribute an average of 10.45% to the 
national GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The increase in the number of construction companies in Indonesia, which 
continues to rise year after year, reflects the development of the industry in Indonesia. Construction companies 
numbered 134,029 in 2015, with a significant rise to 203,403 by 2021. 
 
In Indonesia, construction companies are graded according to their financial status, technical ability, and experience 
(small, medium, and big company). It is driven by unique construction projects undertaken by specific teams

U08, U09, U10, U14, and U15, require special attention in order to apply the right strategy to improve their 
performance (Table 6).

5.2. Graphical Results 
As shown in Table 6, the average performance of state-owned company outperforms that of private companies. The 
range of efficiency values is also wide enough. In general, state-owned companies outperform private companies. To 
see the differences in performance of the two types of companies in greater detail, see Figure 2, which provides an 
overview of the differences in performance by year during the research period. Figure 2 illustrates the impact of 
pandemic conditions that began in 2020. The pandemic conditions slightly impacted the performance of state-owned 
construction companies, resulting in a one-of-a-kind phenomenon. On the other hand, private companies are better 
able to survive and maintain their performance even during a pandemic.  
 
Strategies for improving the performance of construction companies are obtained based on the results of calculations 
over 5 years. First, companies must reduce operating costs and optimize the use of permanent employees, such as by 
implementing results-oriented work, in order to increase work productivity. Second, the company must encourage 
increased revenue; increasing revenue can be accomplished by obtaining new work contracts on construction projects. 
The increase in company income will boost the company's profit.

6. Conclusion 
The pandemic condition, according to the reference obtained, affects various sectors of the country's economy, 
including the construction sector. However, based on the findings of this study, conducted on 18 construction 
companies from 2017 to 2021 using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, the pandemic condition has no 
significant impact on the decline in the performance of construction companies. This is because construction 
companies are still attempting to survive and maintain their performance with their respective abilities. The study 
findings show that the performance of state-owned construction companies is declining due to the pandemic, whereas

960","private construction companies are quite good at maintaining their performance. Nonetheless, government-owned 
construction companies have a higher efficiency value than private construction companies.  
 
This performance calculation can be used as input for the government to develop a policy strategy to improve 
construction company performance. Companies with poor performance must be assisted in order to improve their 
performance, which will have an impact on improving work quality and the construction industry's performance.  
 
The following are some ideas for further research. It would be preferable to include data samples from companies that 
are not publicly traded on the stock exchange in future research. To be able to compare the performance of companies 
listed and unlisted on the stock exchange. Furthermore, it can compare the performance of construction firms based 
on construction fields such as oil and gas, infrastructure, transportation, and others.

Abstract 
 
Encouraging the process of accelerating national strategic projects, several sections of Trans Sumatra Toll Road 
project use design and build contract method that combines several stages into a parallel process which is expected to 
shorten construction time. However, in practice, there is still a phenomenon of project delays which can lead to cost 
overruns and lost opportunities to work on other projects. Therefore, a good control process is needed as a function of 
construction management activities to minimize any deviations that can occur during the project. This study uses the 
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) 6th Edition approach in determining the variables to find out the 
control process and also to identify the risks that occur in the controlling process of Trans Sumatra Toll Road project. 
A literature study was conducted to find control activities and list of risks in similar cases and then validated by experts 
who were directly involved in the process of controlling the Trans Sumatra Toll Road project. The results obtained 
are as many as 94 activities in the control process and as many as 81 lists of risk in the control process. The dominant 
risk factor was obtained using the Relative Important Index (RII) method. The top five risks to the frequency of 
occurrence are as follows: Land acquisition delays, Weather conditions such as high rainfall or extreme weather, Lack 
of control over the implementation schedule, Complicated licensing issues, and Inaccurate DED planning data 
resulting in frequent design reviews

1. Introduction 
The Trans Sumatra toll road project has been declared as a Major Project in the 2020-2024 National Mid-Term 
Development Plan. As one of the efforts to accelerate development, Indonesia Ministry of Public Works and Public 
Housing (PUPR) encourages construction development in conjunction with land acquisition so that several Trans 
Sumatra toll roads used design and build contract system. Design and build is a method where the planning, 
preparation and design processes are carried out in parallel with the construction implementation with the hope that 
the project can be completed faster than conventional methods. However, research on the relevant recent literature 
shows that construction projects with design and build contracts do not escape major cost overruns, delayed schedules 
and quality-related problems. This can be caused by the project control process that is not running well. Planning and 
control are the most basic functions in realizing project success, namely the optimization of construction 
implementation on results with a correlation between cost, quality and time. (Gunadharma et al.  2019)  
 
In the construction of the Trans Sumatra toll road project itself, precisely at the section of Simpang Indralaya - 
Prabumulih, there is a phenomenon of project delays from the time agreed in the initial contract. This toll road project 
has undergone 3 (three) changes or time addendum, which was originally targeted for completion in July 2021 and

Abstract 
 
AI-based self-driving vehicles use open networks and develop self-driving vehicles using ICT technology based on 
artificial intelligence on computer platforms. However, as hacking attacks on electronic control systems of self-driving 
vehicles have become possible, various hacking cases such as vehicle control system attacks and remote-control 
attacks have occurred. Cases of such hacking attacks are increasing the threat of hacking by outside attackers, and if 
self-driving cars become popular, the number of hacking cases will increase further. In this paper, we propose 
countermeasures for hacking attacks in terms of cybersecurity systems and technology to cope with hacking attacks. 
By separately presenting technology and institutional-centric security enhancement measures related to cybersecurity, 
it contributes to the construction of security for self-driving vehicles and the development of cybersecurity for 
unmanned defense robots. As security holes owned by self-driving technology are expected to leak personal 
information or cause personal injury, the need for security research on self-driving cars is increasing, and research on 
hacking attacks and security measures against self-driving cars is needed. As an additional research task, it is necessary 
to study the development of smart keys using NFC communication methods for self-driving vehicles and encryption 
programming methods for security authentication.

1. Introduction 
In this paper, the attack scenario for this vulnerability is described after presenting the attacker's ability and hacking 
attack method based on the attack model for autonomous vehicles. This attack scenario uses software and networks. 
A miniature model in which autonomous vehicle technology is integrated can be produced and tested. Self-driving 
vehicles have built-in electronic control systems and specialized software for communication between internal 
devices, and attack scenarios and countermeasures are studied from the perspective of the internal systems of 
autonomous vehicles through various communication methods. 
 
By transmitting and exchanging via Wi-Fi and RF (Radio Frequency) applied to most vehicles, the electronic devices 
of the vehicle's internal network are controlled, and the vehicle is driven by executing commands according to the 
situation. This allows cyber attackers to manipulate the internal systems of autonomous vehicles and drone bots at 
will through forged messages that can control the main systems if they penetrate the internal systems of autonomous 
vehicles. In addition, software embedded in recently released vehicles has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to 
take control of the vehicle. An attacker who has penetrated the internal system can take control and perform an attack 
that can directly affect safety, such as a brake failure of a vehicle.  
 
An autonomous vehicle model is controlled using a smartphone or PC, and communication uses Wi-Fi, RF, and 
Bluetooth. Therefore, each communication step-by-step attack process is verified through an experiment. Based on 
the experiments and research results of this paper, we study the security measures to identify vulnerabilities that appear 
in attacks on autonomous vehicles and respond to them.

977","Autonomous vehicle hardware hacking threat prevents data exposure by extracting memory through data encryption 
(public key encryption), and cyber security response is possible by removing the functions of interfaces such as LIN 
(Local Interconnect Network) and UART (Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter) to hardware do. The threat of 
information exposure of vehicle drivers can be countered by cyber security through public key driver information data 
encryption, autonomous vehicle management system, biometric authentication (iris and fingerprint recognition), and 
vehicle identification number. 
 
The threat of control right through control data forgery attack between wireless communication is countered by 
providing integrity when communicating with smart devices of MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) and AES 
(Advanced Encryption Standard), and authentication threats through forged user information are It is possible to 
respond to hacking attacks by verifying forgery and verifying integrity through user authentication and user 
authentication.(An et al., 2017). 
 
Data transmission threats related to communication interference between vehicle sensors and systems can respond to 
hacking attacks through authentication techniques that only authenticated devices and users can use when 
communicating between vehicles and systems. In this way, when cyber security technology is applied and technical 
support is provided to counter hacking of autonomous vehicles, a popularized autonomous driving society can be built 
based on the safety of autonomous vehicles. 
 
2.5. Security measures for network vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles 
In this study, we tested the vulnerability of hijacking the vehicle by duplicating the smart key radio wave of the 
autonomous vehicle and found a weakness that can easily analyze the communication frequency using the RF 
transceiver, and it is possible to easily listen to the user's normal signal. Yes, through this, an attacker can try a 
retransmission attack. 
 
Encrypting the communication contents of the smart key prevents data tampering and communication protocol 
information leakage, but is vulnerable to retransmission attacks that replicate and transmit encrypted data identically. 
Therefore, in order to solve the vulnerability of the retransmission attack, it is necessary to verify the RF signal used 
for communication between the autonomous vehicle smart key devices. 
 
As a result of testing using a case where aluminum foil was wrapped outside the smart key and the smart key was 
stored in an electromagnetic wave blocking pouch in order to compensate for the vulnerability to prevent theft of 
autonomous vehicles, after using the actual smart key, aluminum foil and an applied smartphone with electromagnetic 
wave blocking function It has been confirmed that it is safe for cyber security when using the case. 
 
3. Conclusion 
In this paper, in an experimental model of an autonomous vehicle equipped with an AI function, a hacking attack in a 
normal communication state is performed, security vulnerabilities are discovered, and a model to establish security 
measures is proposed.The self-driving vehicle is an orange pie-based self-driving vehicle that is directly controlled 
with a laptop, and machine learning training is implemented to communicate via Wi-Fi. When the autonomous vehicle 
and the laptop were connected, image information was output through the camera on the front of the autonomous 
vehicle, and while checking real-time image information, four motors were driven to make forward-reverse-left-right 
rotation possible. Connected between the autonomous vehicle and the laptop due to the S/W attack of the autonomous 
vehicle 
 
The vulnerability was confirmed by performing a hacking attack on the Wi-Fi network. In addition, the RF 
vulnerability of the smart key was confirmed by the network attack in the autonomous vehicle as well. Although many 
studies on autonomous driving vehicles and V2X wireless communication at home and abroad are being conducted, 
research on system security of autonomous vehicles equipped with various sensors and artificial intelligence functions 
is insufficient. An overview of autonomous vehicles and security vulnerabilities were confirmed through hacking 
attack test results, and cyber security measures for vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles and AI were introduced for 
cyber security measures. In order to compensate for the vulnerabilities for, the results of security enhancement using 
aluminum foil and electromagnetic wave blocking pouch are presented.

Abstract 
 
This paper will focus on artificial intelligence used for judgment during cognition-judgment-control of autonomous 
vehicles. An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can drive itself without the intervention of a driver or passengers. 
Self-driving cars are mainly conducted in the form of research to improve driving safety and driver convenience. 
Autonomous vehicle technology applies the degree of autonomous driving to level 0 automation, Level 1 Driver 
Assistance, Level 2 Partial Automation, Level 3 Conditional Automation, and Level 4 Advanced. The development 
proceeds in stages of High Automation and 5 Stages of Full Automation. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
ranges from level 0 to level 5, and level 3 is the best technology for autonomous driving technology installed in 
currently sold vehicles. This is just a state-of-the-art driver assistance system that allows autonomous driving in a 
certain section and requires the driver to keep an eye on the surroundings to prepare for unexpected situations.

in a global supply chain turbulence situation? (2) How does digitalization contribute to predicting supply chain risk? 
(3) How could network coordination practices mitigate the impacts of disruption events? This paper presents 
antecedents of globalization balancing drivers, network resilience practices, and digital collaboration practices and the 
impact of the antecedents on business performances.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the effect of entrepreneurial marketing which consists of seven 
dimensions, innovation-focused, proactiveness, opportunity, calculated risk-taking, customer intensity, resource 
leveraging, and value creation on business performance mediated by competitive advantage. The research method 
used in this research is a quantitative approach method. Respondents in this study were MSME business actors or 
owners of MSMEs who were selected using a non-probability sampling method with a purposive sampling technique. 
The number of samples collected in this study was 421 MSMEs. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation 
Modeling with Partial Least Square (SEM PLS) approach. Based on the results obtained proactiveness, opportunity, 
and customer intensity have a direct effect on business performance, while the other four variables, namely innovation-
focused, calculated risk-taking, resource leveraging, and value creation, have no significant effect on business 
performance. Customer intensity and calculated risk-taking have no significant effect on competitive advantage. 
Competitive advantage is able to mediate the relationship between opportunity, resource leveraging, and value 
creation.

1. Introduction 
The development of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia is one of the main priorities in 
national economic development. This is because the business is the backbone of the people's economic system which 
is not only aimed at reducing the problem of inequality between income groups and between business actors, or 
poverty and employment. More than that, its development is able to expand the economic base and can make a 
significant contribution to accelerating structural changes, namely increasing the regional economy and national 
economic resilience. The developments in 2011-2012 according to data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small 
and Medium Enterprises were 1,328,163 with a growth of 2.38% while in 2018 MSME actors in Indonesia reached 
nearly 63 million, with that number MSMEs were able to contribute to Indonesia's GDP of around 60 % (Rahayu  
2019). 
 
The MSME sector is a very important sector in the Indonesian economy and society. That said, considering around 
99% of businesses in Indonesia are businesses that are categorized as MSMEs (Lubis  2018). In addition, the MSME 
sector includes various labor-intensive businesses, so this sector is able to involve a large number of available workers. 
In other words, the MSME sector is an important sector for the economic resources of the Indonesian people. Efforts 
need to be made to support the improvement of the performance of MSMEs that are integrated and on target as a form 
of implementation of the people's economic system. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are currently also 
developing in Batam. The existence of Batam City as an Industrial City with many workers provides potential 
opportunities for the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) (Hati & Irawati  2013).

987","The results of the indirect effect can be seen in table 5. Competitive advantage does not mediate the relationship 
between innovation focused and business performance, it can be seen from the p value of 0.126 or more than 0.05, 
similar results are also in the relationship between proactiveness and business performance with a p value of 0.079. 
Competitive advantage is able to mediate the relationship between opportunity and business performance with a p 
value of 0.044 or less than 0.05. Competitive advantage cannot mediate the relationship between calculated risk taking 
and customer intensity on business performance because both p value is more than 0.05. In contrast to resource 
leveraging and value creation on business performance, which can be mediated by competitive advantage as seen from 
the p value of less than 0.05. 
 
From the results that have been described, MSMEs in Batam are always proactive, taking advantage of various 
opportunities and good relationships with customers and in increasing competitive advantage MSMEs continue to 
advance, be proactive, take advantage of existing opportunities, utilize available resources and create value for 
customers. This is also in line with research from Hacioglu et al. (2012) the relationship between EM and MSME 
performance in the Turkish manufacturing industry, found that proactiveness, innovation, customer intensity, and 
resource utilization as EM dimensions are positively related to MSME performance. According to Fatoki (2019), the 
results show that calculated risk taking, customer intensity, resource leveraging, value creation have a significant 
impact on MSME performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results described previously, only proactiveness, opportunity and customer intensity have a direct effect 
on business performance, while the other four variables, namely innovation focused, calculated risk taking, resource 
leveraging and value creation, have no significant effect on business performance. On the other hand, only two 
variables have no significant effect on competitive advantage, namely calculated risk taking and customer intensity. 
In the mediating relationship, competitive advantage is able to mediate the relationship between opportunity, resource 
leveraging and value creation. It is hoped that further research can test using the second order so that it only focuses 
on entrepreneurial marketing as a whole.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of entrepreneurial marketing which consists of innovation-focused, 
proactiveness, opportunity, calculated risk-taking, customer intensity, resource leveraging, and value creation on 
business performance moderated by environmental turbulence in SMEs. The approach used is a quantitative approach 
and data collection is done by distributing online questionnaires. The population of this research is MSMEs in Batam 
City which are registered with the Online Database System (ODS) as many as 81,575. This research uses the purposive 
sampling method. The sampling technique used in the study was purposive sampling based on the following criteria: 
The duration of active micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Batam City has been operating for at least 3 
years, the business sector is engaged in: trading, manufacturing/fabrication, and services. The samples collected and 
used in this study were 421 respondents. The results show that proactiveness, opportunity, value creation, and 
environmental turbulence have a direct effect on business performance, while innovation-focused, calculated risk-
taking, customer intensity, and resource leveraging have no significant effect on business performance, while the 
overall environmental turbulence variable does not moderate the relationship. between entrepreneurial marketing and 
business performance.

1. Introduction 
In Indonesia, MSMEs are one of Indonesia's economic strengths. The Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium 
Enterprises stated that the number of MSMEs in Indonesia reached nearly 63 million. With this number of MSMEs, 
MSMEs can contribute to Indonesia's GDP by as much as 60% or equivalent to Rp. 4,800 trillion (Rahayu, 2019). 
MSMEs are a role in the community by generating sources of income and can create jobs (Febriyantoro et al., 2019). 
It can be seen from the data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) 2020 that recorded the development of the 
number of MSMEs in Indonesia from 2010-to 2018. Based on data the number of MSMEs in Indonesia in 2010 
amounted to 52.8 million and has increased every year until in 2018 the number of MSMEs in Indonesia recorded 
64.2 million.  
 
Indonesia's MSMEs are currently grappling with several difficult new challenges. This is mainly in the form of rapid 
technological developments and regional economic integration which have shadowed them for years but have come 
into sharp focus with the inception of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). However, with the Indonesian 
government now more determined to encourage the growth of MSMEs, the sector could be in a position to turn this 
challenge into an attractive opportunity (GBG indoIndonesia16). Indonesian MSMEs are very important to the 
economy in terms of sustainable growth and employment. They are now facing a new reality being challenged at their 
home through the MEA and thus the requirements to be more competitive and innovative to survive. This new 
paradigm is an opportunity for international investors to take advantage and start looking for partners with small 
companies to access the sectors provided for this form of cooperation. In addition, the idea of digitization will bring 
opportunities to work with MSMEs on the development of new platforms as well as consulting in areas such as 
branding and advertising in Indonesia

1002","existing changes and take advantage of opportunities and create the right value for customers so that this can improve 
the business performance of MSME actors. Meanwhile, the environmental turbulence variable is not able to moderate 
the relationship between entrepreneurial marketing and business performance because the influence of environmental 
turbulence does not really affect being proactive, taking advantage of every return and creating value for customers. 
This is in line with Pratono & Mahmood (2015) which states that only companies that have high entrepreneurial 
autonomy can be affected by technological turbulence. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the exposure of the results of hypothesis testing, the results can be obtained. The variables that directly affect 
business performance are proactiveness, opportunity and value creation, while the other four variables, such as 
innovation focused, calculated risk taking, customer intensity and resource leveraging, have no significant effect on 
business performance. Meanwhile, for the overall moderation test, the environmental turbulence variable is not able 
to moderate the relationship between entrepreneurial marketing and business performance. 
 
For other researchers who want to continue this research, that is by doing second-order testing so that more in-depth 
results on entrepreneurial marketing can be obtained and can also combine mix research methods which can confirm 
quantitative results using qualitative methods with interviews and observations.

Abstract 
 
Research on sustainability has steadily increased in the last few decades, one of them being the food loss and waste 
issue. Indonesia generated 23 – 48 million tons of FLW per year, whereas most of it was generated in the consumption 
stage. The consumption stage, especially the HaFS sector, continues to become a key concern because of its 
contribution to total food waste of around 12%. Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide a set of relevant food 
waste reduction strategies that could be used in the food service sector in Indonesia. Initially, a literature review was 
conducted to identify several food waste reduction strategies that could be used in the foodservice sector. Then, the 
list was validated by a group of experts consisting of restaurant owners and managers, government, non-government, 
and academics. Content validity index (CVI) method was used to evaluate the list of food waste reduction strategies, 
and to get consensus from all of the experts that participated. From 24 strategies that were identified, it then became 
19 strategies with seven strategies from the literature review discarded, and two additional strategies added from the 
suggestion of the expert. Further development of this food waste reduction strategy could be done by employing 
decision-making methods like multi-criteria-decision-making (MCDM).

1. Introduction 
Research on sustainability has steadily increased in the last few decades, one of them being the food loss and waste 
(FLW) issue. According to FAO (2017), about one–third of global food production is lost or wasted along the food 
value chain, or about 1,3 billion tons of food waste per year. FLW is considered an unethical issue, knowing that 
there’s still hunger, food insecurity, and inequality in access to food (Aschemann-Witzel et al. 2018). Moreover, the 
increase in the global population, makes it a significant issue (Rani et al. 2021). From 2000 – to 2019, Indonesia 
generated 23 – 48 million tons of FLW per year, whereas most of it was generated in the consumption stage. It’s 
estimated that 1,702.9 million tons CO2 eq of greenhouse gas emission was generated, the economic loss due to FLW 
generation is around 213 – 551 trillion rupiah per year, and 61 – 125 million people could be fed from it (Bappenas 
2021). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more sustainable food chain to reduce the impact of FLW on humankind.  
 
The reduction of FLW should be implemented across the food supply chain. FLW is estimated to occur at the 
agricultural stage (11 – 23%), during industrial processing (17 – 19%), at the retail stage (8 – 17%), and more than 
50% at the consumption stage (Magalhães et al. 2021). Nevertheless, the drivers of FLW are often dependent on the 
market and the socio-cultural background of the country (Filimonau and  Ermolaev  2021; Teng et al. 2021). At the 
consumption stage, food waste could be generated from the household and the hospitality and foodservice (HaFS) 
sector. The consumption stage, especially the HaFS sector, continues to become a key concern because of its 
contribution to total food waste of around 12% (Dhir et al. 2020). Furthermore, most of the food waste that is generated 
in the HaFS sector could be avoided, approximately around 75% of it is categorized as avoidable food waste (Vizzoto 
et al. 2021). Hence, the HaFS sector has been identified as one with a lot of promise for reducing food waste 
(Papargyropoulou et al. 2019).

1014","“Appropriate Storage & Handling Food” by improving storage technologies and applying storage–handling 
management, this strategy could reduce food wastage as a storage waste where food quality and safety are guaranteed 
for human consumption.  
 
On the preparation level, all of the strategies are accepted by the experts, rejecting one of the additional ones suggested 
by one of the experts. On this side, activity relates to transforming raw food materials into ready-to-serve food. 
“Adopting FIFO practice” is one of the ways to reduce the storage waste in the foodservice sector, and a lot of 
researchers also support the implementation of this strategy (Filimonau et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2021). “Repurposing 
Leftovers”, meanwhile it could be seen as one of the strategies for reducing the food waste, it should be done 
cautiously, because of the characteristics of food that is easy to spoil (Filimonau et al. 2020; Vizzoto et al. 2021). 
“Reduce Overcooking” is a strategy that could be related to improving the cooking technique so it could reduce the 
overcooking but still maintain the level of responsiveness to new orders.  
 
On the serving level, it relates to how food is served to the customer. Four out of identified strategy rejected, leaving 
four of the strategy, with an additional one strategy from the expert suggestion. “Portion Size (Offering Different 
Options)” is accepted by the expert, also it is one of the strategies that numerous studies talk about to reduce the food 
waste in the foodservice sector. “Buffet Management”, with appropriate management of buffets, for example, refilling 
activities, and pre-positioning food items could influence customer behavior and the recoverability of the items that 
did not consume by customers so it reduces the serving waste (Vizzoto et al. 2021). “Serving Style Adjustment” and 
“Doggy Bags” could also reduce the food waste that happens at the serving level. There is one additional strategy 
“Portion Size (Accurate Control)”, which helps restaurant staff to serve the food at the accurate serving size. 
 
On the customer behavior level, from four strategies that had been identified, only one was accepted. One of the 
experts said that these strategies indeed could be used to reduce the food waste that happens in the foodservice sector, 
but if it is in the Indonesian context, it doesn’t seem to be visible of doing that, because of one or two things. 
“Collecting Feedback” is the only strategy accepted by the experts, where it may seem the easiest and the most 
convenient way to know more about customer behavior. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The finding of this study could provide a valuable reference for reducing food waste in the foodservice sector in the 
context of Indonesia. From the literature review, we have identified 24 food waste reduction strategies that could be 
used by the foodservice sector in Indonesia. These strategies are based on different points of foodservice processes, 
managerial, procurement and storage, preparation, serving, and customer behavior. Then it was validated by CVI 
methods, with the help of five experts from different stakeholders, restaurant owners and managers, government 
(Bappenas), non-government (food bank), and also from academics (lecturer). This study resulted in 19 strategies, 
with seven strategies from the literature review discarded, and two additional strategies added from the suggestion of 
the expert. The value of S – CVI is 0.89 which is concluded as acceptable by all of the experts. 
 
Further development of this food waste reduction strategy could be done by employing decision-making methods like 
multi-criteria-decision-making (MCDM), to obtain the key strategy that drives others or evaluate the interrelationship 
between strategies to obtain the prioritization of the development of food waste reduction strategy.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia's 2019 Human Development Index (HDI) hasn’t met the targets set in the 2019 State Revenue and 
Expenditure Budget. Education is one of the things that can be improved to increase HDI. One of the non-formal 
educational institutions in Indonesia is the Pusat Kegiatan Belajar Masyarakat (PKBM). West Java Province with the 
highest number of PKBM in Indonesia doesn’t have any A-accredited PKBM, describing the lack of education quality 
there. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has made a stark difference to the education system which must be 
implemented online. The purpose of this study is to analyze the education quality of PKBM in West Java along with 
the factors that must be improved and how to improve them. The survey method was carried out by using EduQUAL 
dimensions. Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) was used to classify the priority of each indicator from the survey 
results. The indicators collected in Quadrant A were further analyzed using Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The 
quality factors that must be improved: Availability of documents on the type and amount of learning equipment, 
Availability of documents for the existence of study room and office infrastructure, Availability of syllabus documents 
for each program, and Availability of RPP documents. IPA and QFD produced 3 technical responses to improve the 
quality of PKBM education in West Java ordered by its priorities: Activating discussion forums among PKBM 
institutions, Improving the procurement of PKBM infrastructures, and Providing training on making RPP on a regular 
basis for PKBM teachers.

1. Introduction 
The way the population of a country can access development outcomes in obtaining education, health, and income is 
illustrated in the Human Development Index (HDI). HDI in Indonesia in 2019; ie 0.718; only ranked fifth in Southeast 
Asia. Indonesia lost to Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, and Singapore (UNDP  2020). In addition, the HDI 
figure has not met the target set by the government in the 2019 State Revenue and Expenditure Budget; ie 0.720 (CNN 
Indonesia  2021). 
 
Education is one of the things that can be improved to increase the HDI value. In Indonesia, education is carried out 
through three channels: formal, non-formal, and informal (Kemdikbud  2003). Non-formal education is an alternative 
for Indonesian people who are experiencing economic difficulties (Yossiana  2018). Based on data from the Ministry 
of Education and Culture in 2020 there are 3.47% of Indonesian people take the non-formal route for their education 
(kemdikbud  2020). One of the non-formal institutions in Indonesia is the Pusat Kegiatan Belajar Masyarakat (PKBM), 
which is community-based and is required to constantly innovate in order to produce community empowerment 
programs with a transformative character (Rizka & Tamba  2015). PKBM is an educational institution founded, by, 
and for the community. 
 
In order to maintain the quality of education in PKBM, since 2010 accreditation has been carried out by the Badan 
Akreditasi Nasional Pendidikan Nonformal (BAN PNF). In 2014, BAN PNF changed its name to the Badan Akreditasi 
Nasional Pendidikan Anak Usia Dini dan Pendidikan Nonformal (BAN PAUD & PNF). After being reviewed by 
BAN PAUD & PNF, from the highest quality level to the lowest, each PKBM was given the predicate of A, B, C, to

1023","been carried out per district once a year by the PKBM communication forum (FK-PKBM) in collaboration with the 
education authorities, but the current condition is still not effective because there is no specific teaching forum for 
certain subjects. RPP training is still mixed from one subject to another. For future improvements, it is necessary to 
create a teaching forum per subject for each district so that the training in making lesson plans is more targeted. During 
the COVID-19 pandemic, RPP training that had existed before the pandemic could still run well.  
 
In general, it can be said that all existing technical responses are external. This may happen because all respondents 
who participated in this study were managed without involving other stakeholders. The drawbacks of the EduQUAL 
and QFD methods seem to be visible here. EduQUAL and QFD only use one type of population as the object of 
research so that the solution generated from the analysis feels less broad. The four customer requirements analyzed 
by QFD should be able to find an internal solution. Among them in general, because accreditation is closely related 
to documentation activities in basic education data (dapodik), each PKBM can improve craftsmanship and order in 
the input process at the dapodik in order to get maximum points during accreditation. Then specifically, to increase 
the availability of syllabus and lesson plans, it is possible to evaluate the quality of the syllabus and lesson plans that 
are already running, look for improvement opportunities, make improvements, and monitor so that the improvement 
process can be sustainable. These activities could be carried out independently by each PKBM. 
 
There is no perfect research. Singh & Rawani (2019) only focused on one institution so their research could not be 
generalized (Singh & Rawani  2019). Dumitriu (2018), only focuses on students and does not involve all stakeholders 
in engineering study programs in their research (Dumitriu  2018). Herwanto et al. (2013), only focused on one type of 
customer, namely parents of students (Herwanto  2013). Whereas according to Praptaningsih (2010) in Herwanto 
(2013), school customers are divided into two: internal customers (teachers and administrative staff) and external 
customers (students, parents, alumni empowerers) (Herwanto  2013). The research of Devani & Kartikasari (2012) is 
limited in the scope of research because they only researched one institution, so the research results cannot be 
generalized (Devani & Kartikasari  2012). This research is also not free from shortcomings given the limited space, 
especially when the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and the study period is limited. Researchers only focus on 
improving the quality of PKBM education in West Java which is accredited B by only involving PKBM managers 
without involving other stakeholders and not being able yet to benchmark with PKBM from other provinces. Thus 
this research shares its shortcomings with past research (Dumitriu  2018; Herwanto, 2013) in terms of the limitations 
of the stakeholders studied. However, when compared to other studies, this research is quite interesting because it 
involves institutional managers in many places in one province so that the result in this research could implement in 
all accredited B-PKBM in West Java, Indonesia. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The quality factors of PKBM education in West Java that must be improved consist of four items that are the main 
priority belonging to the two dimensions of EduQUAL, namely the Physical Facility Dimension (F) and the Academic 
Dimension (A). The dimensions of Physical Facilities (F) consist of the attributes of Availability of type and number 
of learning equipment in PKBM documents (F1), as well as Availability of the existence of PKBM office and study 
room infrastructure: type/length/width/number of rooms/room area documents (F3). The Academic dimension (A) 
consists of the Availability of syllabus documents for each program held by PKBM (A1), as well as the Availability 
of Learning Implementation Plan (RPP) documents for each program held by PKBM (A2). The proposal for improving 
the quality of PKBM education in West Java, especially for those accredited B, is with three corrective actions in 
order of priority: Activating discussion forums for heads of institutions and tutors so that they can share management 
practices in each PKBM institution, increase assistance in the procurement of facilities infrastructure for PKBM, as 
well as providing training on making RPP on a regular basis for PKBM teachers. For future research, it can be done 
on PKBM accredited C or not accredited (TT) and in a wider area scope. This research shows that in PKBM accredited 
B the average internal condition is good enough so that external improvements are more expected. It is possible that 
accredited C and TT-PKBM will show different results. In terms of methods, other EduQUAL gaps can be used, for 
example from the scope of the customer or even by tracing the use of improvement methods other than EduQUAL, 
IPA, and QFD.

Abstract 
 
There is a discovery of space limitless within the laboratories particularly for universities. This is centered on the 
multifunctioning university laboratory that generate practical for semester and yearly students. Storages within 
the laboratory has shown capabilities in storing a maximum of metal and all other type of material but that reduces 
the available space. Space maximization project with high technical and engineering skill obligation. An early 
fulfillment of space with the laboratory increases the health and safety failure every year and might results in 
increase of injuries with the work pace. This article adopts inventory control, facilitates planning and material 
handling to reveal the major challenges. As university laboratories are improved in storing through engineering 
design to maximize space will have positive impact manufacturing industries as well by improving material 
control and limiting the unnecessary incidents. The statistical technique was further employed to quantify the 
improvements through fabrication of raw material. Results show that metal material can be protected from 
abstracting rust by fabricating the steel material shelves designing. A proper technology involvement to fabricate 
all material utilized within the laboratories still to be addressed in the future through research.

1. Introduction 
Fabrication of raw steel material shelves is enforced by the accumulation of material in the flow, as every time 
space keeps on shrinking in the eyes of supervision. Inventory control is the major conduct that can lead in 
improvement of organisation turnover. Steel material is one the scarce material as they are ordered in the well-
established countries if your country is still in developing state. Garvey, Norman and Barrett, (2022), believe that 
future steel demand can be affected multiple uncertainties and be controlled by the everchanging global economy.  
In South Africa most of our university laboratories seem to surfer from the unavailable of space. This is the result 
of the accumulating material and final product. Space within university laboratories is utilised by the students, 
laboratory technician, laboratory equipment, raw material ordered, and finished products produced by the 
students. Therefore, free open space is needed to ensure numerous factors such as prevention of unnecessary 
incidents. In addition to this is to ensure stick is controlled properly especial steel raw material. 
 
An unattended material ends in the wrong hands for personal reason which does not benefit the laboratories. The 
scope of laboratory management is to ensure safety within laboratory and control the material among others. It 
further creates a potential hazard to people walking around the laboratory consignment of requested steel material 
which was delivered and left cluttered on the laboratory floor posing hazard. This urgently necessitated a selection 
for a raw steel storage area and appropriate reaction from the laboratory management. 
 
The aim of this article is to address the unavailability of space within our university laboratories. To ensure that 
the challenges is addressed properly, it was necessary to develop the following research questions: 
 
- What are the root causes of the unavailability of space within the university laboratories? 
- How much space will be consumed by the fabrication steel raw material shelve? 
- Will developing inventory control system necessary to address the current challenge? 
- What are the relevant costs and skills of developing the needed fabrication framework to control the steel raw 
material?

As university laboratory has using the undocumented way of reordering system which have led to steel material 
to overflow in the floor for unintended utilization. This has been driven by the availability of budget to be used 
for ordering material in the laboratory. Therefore, before any order is being processed and double checking of the 
fabricated steel shelves must correspond with the need of ordering. Figure 3 above clear outline the technicalities 
that will asking the university laboratory to function at it best through controlling inventory within the laboratory.

3. It also reduces chances of injuries to personnel. 
4. It complies with OHS legislation in terms of safety compliance. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The importance of maximising space withing the university laboratories has been the overlooked because the 
group utilising the laboratories keeps on changing every semester and every year. Based on the demand of 
ensuring safety in the working area and implementing improvement has yield positive outcomes to the university 
facilities.

that safety majors are putted in place. 
 
Recommendation 
The end-user of the system must be trained to report the use of material so that everyone if keen to inform the 
laboratory to place an order. The effective use of fabricated shelve with ensure safety to the individuals if all 
material will be removed from the floor into the fabricated shelve. Based on the need of safe space to move around 
the laboratory as well. Major space should be free if it not occupied by the machines in the laboratory and proper 
storing shelves such as fabricated steel shelve. Demarcation of the laboratory is highly recommended for everyone 
to be safe and understand where he/she can walk, or which machine is found where.

Abstract 
 
Research and Innovation are included in the Indonesian government's medium and long-term agenda to realize 
Indonesia's vision as an advanced economy by 2045. However, the low research and innovation spending in Indonesia 
is still a critical problem. The Triple Helix arrangement model in conducting research and innovation is one of the 
important things for technological and economic progress. In Indonesia, there are at least three funding schemes that 
apply the triple helix arrangement model with their respective measurement instruments such as TKT and Katsinov. 
However, in the use of these instruments, there are still obstacles that are difficult for users to understand, both among 
researchers, industry, and practitioners. So, the researchers tried to adapt the Balanced Readiness Level Assessment 
(BRLa) which was previously developed in Norway through a design thinking approach into a Customized BRLa 
prototype to be used as a triple helix model funding assessment instrument. This prototype can still be developed up 
to the implementation and trial stages for funders or reviewers in assessing proposals as well as monitoring and 
evaluating the implementation of research funded by the triple helix model, so that in the future it is hoped that 
research, development and innovation funding will be mostly given by the government by taking into account its 
readiness can produce optimal and useful outcomes.

1. Introduction 
Technology is widely regarded as a key driver of innovation and sustainable business growth. Measurement of 
technology readiness has been widely discussed by several experts. Starting with the Technology Readiness Level 
(TRL) introduced by NASA in the 1970s and Mankin (1995) providing definitions and examples of the nine levels of 
TRL and the scale has been refined and elaborated by other experts (Heslop, et. al., 2001; Mankins 2009; H`eder 2017; 
EARTO 2014). 
 
Referring to Nolte (2008) that technology is a multi-faceted subject, the assessment of technology readiness does not 
offer a comprehensive understanding of the maturity of a product or what is required for a successful technology 
transition. New technologies may be promising and create new possibilities, but their development and 
implementation are complex. Existing methods for examining and tracking innovation progress are almost exclusively 
focused on aspects of technological development, therefore Dent and Pettit (2011) argue that a more holistic approach 
is needed to assess a product. Technological maturity by introducing market readiness (Market Readiness Level, MRL) 
as an additional aspect, will prove beneficial. 
 
Kobos et al (2018) developed the TRL method when building the so-called “Regulatory Readiness Level” (RRL). 
While TRL focuses on the technological aspects of a product, RRL addresses regulations that affect the 
commercialization of new technologies. They argue that even fully operational and market-ready technologies may 
fail without regulatory support. The underlying factors for RRL are access to, and understanding of, the regulatory 
process, the effectiveness and safety of regulatory support, the “do no harm” principle, and the political and social 
acceptability of the project or technology.

as follows: 
1) Has 5 Dimensions 
2) Has 9 Scales for each Dimension 
3) Arranged in Automatic Spreadsheet (Filling with checklist) 
4) Rating from lowest to highest scale questions (ensures no level of readiness is missed) 
5) There is an assessment index to be considered in decision making 
6) Statements and Questions adapted for general use in research projects 
7) Can see progress, assessment more than once (different time/different rater) 
8) The assessment guide is prepared to be guided by CBRLa users 
9) Provided in two languages (English | Bahasa) 
10) Can provide notes on each achievement level of readiness 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the prototype development which was carried out through the design thinking stage starting from the 
empathy stage which resulted in 5 user personas of users of research readiness instruments funded by the triple helix 
model, namely Researchers, Research Institutes, Reviewers, Funders, and Partners/Industry. Furthermore, it is defined 
that the user needs a standard tool that can be validated to be able to see the readiness of research/ 
development/innovation so that an overview of the current position and recommended improvement points can be 
obtained so that the results of research/development/innovation can be commercialized/implemented properly. This 
prototype can still be developed up to the implementation and trial stages for funders or reviewers in assessing 
proposals as well as monitoring and evaluating the implementation of research funded by the triple helix model.

Abstract  
 
Humanitarian activities related to natural disaster management and humanitarian operations have increased since 
2020, when this period became the most prominent case in the last two decades. The role of humanitarian organizations 
and their supply chains is critical in prevention, response, and recovery. This study evaluates the maturity level of the 
current supply chain condition in handling humanitarian operations and disaster management by the ACT Foundation 
as an Indonesian Humanitarian Organization. This study applies a maturity assessment model with five levels and 
case studies from the ACT Foundation in three different areas. Analyzing the 14 dimensions of maturity assessment 
and 81 processes of the ACT Foundation for South Tangerang and Tangerang District branches, only the dimensions 
of goals and performance, human resource management, and services to residents have a maturity level between 3 
Intermediate and 4 Advanced. The results of the maturity level are below 2 Elementary for the South Tangerang and 
Tangerang Regency branches, namely focusing on the disaster phase, strategic planning, transportation and capacity 
planning, search and rescue processes, and support operations. The results of the maturity level of the Head Office 
Jakarta assessment with a value below level 3 are information and data management and continuous improvement and 
collaboration. This study ensures that the humanitarian supply chain has reached the appropriate maturity level, 
namely level 4 Advanced to 5 Optimized. Improvements in the humanitarian supply chain focus on the maturity 
dimension with a maturity level of less than 4 Advanced, with a management approach and operational strategies.

1. Introduction  
Recently, the world has been hit by various catastrophic events, making 2020 the biggest year for disaster events that 
occurred nearly two decades earlier (CRED International Disaster Database  2021). The number of disasters in 2020 
was 389 events, more significant than the annual average from 2000 to 2019. Especially for handling disasters in 
Indonesia, the government agency with the authority and responsibility is the National Disaster Management Agency 
(BNPB). Based on data released by BNPB states that the total number of disasters in 2021 is 5,402, which is more 
significant than the number of catastrophes in 2020, which reached 4,650 events. From this perspective, currently, 
Humanitarian Supply Chain Management (HSCM) has received more attention from researchers and practitioners. in 
seeking ways to improve logistics processes and service delivery (Gralla et al. 2015). Humanitarian Supply Chain 
(HSC) is a crucial component in disaster management because almost 60 – 80 percent of the costs incurred in 
humanitarian activities are for logistics activities, an essential aspect of the supply chain (Van Wassenhove, 2006). 
Increasing the number of disasters is a challenge for the government and humanitarian agencies to improve the

The results of the maturity level are below 2 Elementary for the Tangerang Raya and Tangerang Regency branches 
(Figure 6), namely focusing on the disaster phase, strategic planning, transportation and capacity planning, search and 
rescue processes, and support operations. The results of the maturity level of the Jakarta Head Office assessment with 
a value below 3 Intermediate are information and data management and continuous improvement and collaboration. 
This study ensures that the humanitarian supply chain has reached the appropriate maturity level, namely level 4 
Advanced to 5 Optimized. The proposed strategy to improve the maturity process has been discussed with the relevant 
respondents as program implementing personnel of the organization. However, in applying the maturity model for the 
humanitarian supply chain in this study, there are suggestions for further research. The aspect that can develop is the 
exploration of case studies with other humanitarian organizations both in Indonesia and other countries. In addition, 
it is possible to create a maturity dimension and processes that are specific to other programs of humanitarian 
organizations outside of disaster management and humanitarian aid operations. Direct assessment in field observations 
to see the actual implementation of the humanitarian supply chain of the organization is an area that can also develop 
further in further research.

1. Introduction 
Over the past two years, the world in general has witnessed a shift in consumer priorities. Despite the difficulties in 
continuing global manufacturing production due to the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, not only did companies 
manufacturing essential products continue to work, but demand volumes increased. Now more than ever, the 
utilization of raw materials and installed production capacity has become more important and waste generation less 
tolerable. The Baja California medical device manufacturing cluster has been part of this reality, in which projects 
have been aimed at reducing downtime, increasing linear flow, reducing waste in general and validating each of the 
changes proposed during the improvement process. 
This case study was developed in a company that provides assembly services for medical products, the objective was 
to reduce and/or eliminate bottlenecks and unnecessary operations, in order to generate an increase in production

1067","5. Conclusions 
As part of the multidisciplinary team of the engineering area it is important to take responsibility for the actions that 
are being carried out and perform them in the most appropriate way, as a manufacturing engineer it is necessary to 
follow the DMAIC methodology so that the process and the product to be manufactured comply with the requirements 
established by ISO-13485. Once the results of the different improvements made in the production area have been 
analyzed, we can conclude by mentioning the importance of seeking continuous improvement in the processes. The 
development of this project demonstrates that with the use of DMAIC tools aided by experts in the process and with 
the help of tools such as SIPOC and Line Balancing, to mention a few, we can direct the efforts of a work team towards 
the fulfillment of continuous improvement. There are different methodologies and tools to solve problems and acquire 
knowledge, so we must always take into account all solution options, keeping in mind the technical and economic 
feasibility. This also forces us to make the necessary considerations about which techniques to apply depending on 
the complexity of the problem. 
 
During the evaluation process in the ACIST area, which had an insufficient production capacity to cover the new 
demand of the Customer, it was decided to make an improvement proposal supported by the DMAIC methodology in 
order to increase the production capacity of the ""ATP Hand Controller"" line. A line balance was performed to detect 
which were the workstations with bottlenecks and focus on them to reduce cycle times of operations, also applied 
tools such as the 5 whys and Pareto diagram to find the root cause and based on these results, implement improvements. 
Documentation and organization were key to the completion of this project, the organization to perform the tasks in a 
timely manner if any activity was delayed efforts or resources were added if it was in the critical path, for the part of 
documentation everything must be recorded for future audits. In all projects there will be pressure to release them in 
the established time or reduce the execution time of certain faces, as well as trying to reduce costs, however it is 
important to remember that it is not convenient to deliver a project on time and with lower cost if it does not work or 
if the final patient runs any risk, quality is everyone's responsibility and this responsibility is in the organization and 
in the staff that executes the validation. Next we will see the objectives of the before and after project: 
• 
Increase production capacity from 50 boxes to 80 boxes per hour, by which would be 60% more capacity. 
• 
Increased 60% of production capacity from 50 boxes to 80 boxes per hour. 
• 
Reduced production shifts from 4 to 3 per day. 
• 
Reduced production shifts from 4 to 3 per day. 
• 
Decrease $35,000 dlls labor cost per month. 
Final project savings was approximately $32,000 per month.

Abstract 
 
In the past decade, construction supply chain management (CSCM) has become a considerable concern, because the 
cost of materials and material-related activities in most construction projects accounts for 50% to 60% of the total 
project costs. Where material costs are mostly paid to suppliers, supplier selection is one of the most important issues 
in running a supply chain system. Construction materials procurement and management activities play a role in 
responding to the challenges of reducing inventories, speeding up deliveries, and lowering overall project costs. This 
study proposes supplier selection with a multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) approach, as well as 
transportation planning with a transhipment model that is suitable for the construction industry. The hybrid MCDM 
strategy is applied sequentially by combining Criteria Importance Through Inter-Criteria Correlation (CRITIC) and 
Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) to get more effective results and get some of the best 
suppliers from the available options, which will then be simulated routes cost-optimized transportation using the 
transhipment model. This research will produce optimal procurement costs and show the relationship between supplier 
selection and material transportation to overall procurement costs in the construction industry.

1. Introduction 
The construction industry accounts for about 13% of the global economy and serves as a key driver for other industries 
as a result of the construction of its infrastructure and facilities (Waddell 2008). However, the construction sector 
continues to face challenges related to productivity, safety, quality and environmental impact (Choudhry  2017). The 
construction industry has a lower level of productivity compared to other industries (Barbosa et al.  2017). This is 
forcing the construction industry to innovate and rethink the concept of project planning and execution (Moussaoui et 
al. 2021). Construction activities are highly dependent on logistics activities, around 60-80% of the total work involves 
materials and services (Sezer & Fredriksson  2021). Barbosa et al. (2017) highlights performance issues in construction 
and proposes seven performance-enhancing factors. Construction site logistics and supply chain management (SCM) 
are among the seven factors to improve construction project site performance (Sundquist et al. 2018; Vrijhoef & 
Koskela  2000). These factors develop over time to become more specific. The term construction supply chain 
management (CSCM) has developed in the last decade and has become a matter of considerable attention (Safa et al. 
2014). The condition that underlies this is the total cost of purchasing materials and the costs of activities directly 
related to materials in the majority of construction projects reaching 50-60% of the total project costs (Cengiz et al. 
2017; Safa et al. 2014). Activities that are directly related to materials such as handling in warehouses, loading and 
unloading at ports and shipping from point of origin to point of destination. Most of the material costs are paid to 
suppliers, with the result that supplier selection is one of the important issues in running the supply chain system (Pal 
et al. 2013). Most construction service companies prefer to make a contract with the supplier for the purchase of 
materials including delivery, so that the costs incurred by the construction service company for the purchase and 
delivery of materials are fully paid to the supplier (Thunberg  2016). Purchasing activities up to material delivery can 
be called procurement activities. Construction materials procurement and management activities play a role in

5.4. Validation 
After obtaining the weights of each criterion, a consistency analysis is carried out 
to ensure the weighting of the scale on a pair of choices does not deviate from other 
options so that the matrix has met the requirements to be able to proceed to the 
next stage of analysis. Consistency meets when CR≤0.1. Calculation of CR using 
equation (5). The results of the calculation of CI = 0.11 and RI = 1.32 for a matrix of 
size 7x7, so that CR = 0.09 is obtained which has met the consistency requirements. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the research that has been done, it can be concluded that the results of data processing show the ranking of 
each supplier against each criterion affecting the final ranking. The analysis stage of supplier selection using CRITIC-
EDAS with transportation optimization analysis of the transhipment model with an arrangement of 21 suppliers shows 
similar final results, where at the supplier selection analysis stage there are similarities in K3 criteria, relatively large 
production capacity and K6 criteria, relatively cheap product prices. The results of the optimization of the transhipment 
model of transportation with the composition of 21 suppliers also show that the two top-ranked suppliers are included 
in the three shipments with the highest volume. The criteria for K1, K2, K4, K5, and K7 show a less significant effect 
on the transportation optimization analysis of the transhipment model. 
 
The transportation optimization of the transhipment model compared to the direct transport model in this study shows 
that the transhipment model is more efficient in terms of transportation costs. This is influenced by the lower 
transportation costs per unit of material due to the larger load capacity of the fleet used from the transhipment point 
to the construction project site. However, in terms of time, the transhipment model takes longer to complete the 
transportation of materials to the construction project site.

Abstract  
 
The implementation of the interior project development delays so that the total duration of the development a setback, 
the occurrence of the delay was due to waste in project activities. Based on this, this study aims to analyze the types 
of waste and their causes and make an improvement that can result in timely scheduling for the next SOHO (Small 
Office Home Office) project. The approach used is the Project Management and Lean Construction. Project 
management approach by monitoring the s curve and identify the critical path using the critical path method (CPM), 
this approach is used to see differences in weekly progress and the critical path in interior work. The lean construction 
approach uses value stream mapping to identify waste in current state mapping, fishbone diagrams to describe the 
causes of waste, and future state mapping to describe improvements that will be made in order to produce timely 
project scheduling. The result of this research, there is waste in the critical work of this project, it is a waste of defects, 
inventory, and waiting. The cause of waste that occurs in the implementation of interior projects is waste waiting 
because the material is stored in a warehouse located far from the workshop, so it takes a long time. Waste defects by 
checking material samples and waste inventory by submission of materials with the same specifications. So from the 
proposed improvement, the duration of the interior project is 15 days faster from 85 days to 70 days.

1. Introduction  
Construction is the arrangement of the elements of a building, where the position of each part is in accordance with 
its function. In construction, there are also 4 (four) types of construction, namely residential construction, building 
construction, heavy engineering construction, and industrial construction. 
According to data from the BCI Indonesia Construction Market Outlook 2021 report entitled “Preparing for Tomorrow 
– Indonesia's 2021 Construction Market Recovery Outlook”, residential projects are estimated to increase by 48.71% 
in 2021. So, residential development will continue to experience rapid growth (Antaranews  2020). This is supported 
by increasing demand for property. According to PPKOM (2020), Property demand in the fourth quarter of 2020 grew 
by 0.03% (QoQ). The apartment category grew by 3.01% (QoQ) in the fourth quarter of 2020 after experiencing a 
decline of -13.26% (QoQ) in the previous quarter. This increase in demand was driven by an increase in the trend of 
staycation and work from home (WFH) (PPKOM, 2020). 
In the implementation of construction development, there are problems that can hinder the course of construction and 
result in delays in project completion time. In Indonesia, the number of delays in completing construction projects is 
55%, which is still relatively small compared to India’s 57%, Saudi Arabia’s 59% and Pakistan’s more than 90% 
(Roslan  2015).

From the future state mapping, it can be seen that there is a difference in the resulting duration. The implementation 
of interior projects is 17.65% faster than the current state, reducing the duration from 85 days to 70 days. 
6. Conclusion 
From the results of the study, it can be concluded that: 
1. Waste that occurs in interior projects is waste waiting, defects, and inventory. The cause of waste that occurs in 
the implementation of interior projects is waste waiting because the material is stored in a warehouse located far 
from the workshop, so it takes a long time, so operators have to wait to carry out the production process. The 
cause of the waste defect is due to measurement and cutting errors by unskilled operators, materials that do not 
meet specifications. The cause of inventory waste is because the material stock from the supplier is empty, 
material planning errors, and the absence of alternative suppliers. 
2. The proposed activity improvement in order to reduce the waste is waste waiting by delivery of materials from 
suppliers directly to the workshop, merging processes. Waste defects by checking material samples and waste 
inventory by submission of materials with the same specifications. 
So from the proposed improvement, the duration of the interior project is 15 days faster from 85 days to 70 days.

Abstract 
 
The educational scenario of current university higher education is challenging. It is in this context that public 
universities have been experiencing changes of great importance in the educational system, moving from attendance 
to the new form of virtuality. This reality shows that universities are adopting the intensive use of digital tools in 
teachers and students, in the case of teachers, this process goes from planning to the evaluation of student learning 
achievements, allowing active participation. in this whole process. In this context, the research problem arises: How 
are disruptive strategies related to the use of digital tools in public universities in the Amazon in times of COVID - 
19?, and as a general objective: Determine how relates the disruptive strategies in the use of digital tools in public 
universities in the Amazon in the time of COVID - 19. In this sense, the disruptive strategy based on the use of digital 
tools is of great relevance to develop learning. The implementation of disruptive strategies in university education as 
a paradigm from the teacher's actions is conceived with a critical view of innovative practices in the new context of 
virtuality, making use of digital tools and seeking new solutions to the pedagogical problems reflected. in teaching 
practices. The use of digital tools in the university educational field allows the development of the virtual meeting 
between teachers and students; Likewise, it facilitates a series of daily tasks because they can be simultaneously 
connected to various technological devices and access virtual platforms to present the sessions or topics to be discussed 
in a selected manner, schedule videoconferences, forums, tasks, surveys, digital whiteboards, assistance, online 
evaluations. line, share screen, schedule videos and other activities in the virtual environment interweaving

study variables; that is, that the disruptive strategies (X) correspond in proportion in each of the five categories with 
the use of digital tools (Y) in the public universities of the Amazon in times of COVID-19; which indicates that there 
is a frequency association between the two variables.

The results have made it possible to determine the relationship between disruptive strategies and the use of digital 
tools in public universities of the Amazon in the time of COVID - 19, taking as a sample the teachers of the National 
University of San Martín, given that the value of p = Sig. Asymptotic = 0.0001057< a = 0.05, H0 is rejected and Ha 
is accepted. Regarding the results of the application of the instrument between disruptive strategies and the use of 
interactive digital pedagogy in teachers, the value of p = Sig Asymptotic = 0.001921< a = 0.05; Therefore, H0 is 
rejected and H1 is accepted. Likewise, the results of the application of the instrument referring to disruptive strategies 
and the use of the digital platform in teachers are evidenced, having the value of p = Sig. Asymptotic = 0.01226 < a = 
0.05; consequently, H0 is rejected and H2 is accepted; Thus, disruptive strategies are significantly related to the use 
of interactive digital pedagogy and digital platform in teachers of public universities in the Amazon in times of 
COVID-19; finally, these are dependent and have a significant relationship.

Abstract 
 
Real time information and data’s growing significance are changing the way we gather and interact with information. 
A mob of hardware and software innovations are pushing connectivity beyond today’s known limits. This paper will 
give an overview of how Industry 4.0 typical processes from the edge to the cloud collects, aggregates and stores real-
time information using low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. A description of each layer and step 
guaranteeing the data flow will be analyzed to understand how each connected device create the Internet of things 
(IoT) environment. The presented platform used for this analysis will demonstrate each process and communication 
protocol involved like the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). 
 
Keywords 
Gateway, MQTT, SPI, IoT, Messages 
 
1. Introduction 
In a nutshell, the concept of Internet of Things refers to a network of interacting devices connected to the Internet 
(Atzori et al. 2017). The abstraction of devices as “objects” is possible due to the development of powerful embedded 
computers and microcontrollers with optimized energy consumption and small physical footprint. In a typical IoT 
architecture, the message exchange process is modeled by a connection layer which is often described as the input 
layer (Fatima et al.  2020). Messages arriving to the connection layer are then transformed into data and dispatched to 
other processing layers within the architecture (Lee et al.  2015  ;  Ganguli et al. 2017). 
 
It is common for businesses to track and analyze their operation processes. The introduction of IoT enables tracking, 
analysis and even forecasting in real time. This extends the Internet connectivity to a more detailed level than the one 
enjoyed by traditional computers and computer systems. According to (Karie et al.  2020), more than 38 billion objects 
will be connected to the Internet as soon as 2025. This new connectivity extension is not only confined to the IoT 
domain. In fact, this is already visible in areas such as information technologies, digital enterprises, data analytics and 
artificial intelligence. Furthermore, revenues generated by IoT platforms, edge computing and tier software worldwide 
are estimated to be 136 to 235 billion dollars in the next few years (Liu  2017). 
 
Process management and monitoring is common practice in modern organizations. Technological evolution entails 
organizational adaptation in order to be efficient and competitive. Thus, the evolution of Business Process 
Management systems can be correlated with several industrial revolution phases that have occurred since the 
beginning of the 20th century. With information sharing, through IoT, industries are able to adapt and become 
responsive to the collected data (Lee et al.  2015). In this way, manufacturers can offer individualized products while 
maintaining manufacturing infrastructure capable of mass production (Lasi et al.  2014). There are at least four steps 
involved in most IoT messaging. These steps are: i) Acquisition; ii) Aggregation; iii) Transmission; v) Saving; vi) 
analyzing. Using sensing devices and controllers to collect raw data is the first step. The data are then grouped to form

1112","As mentioned earlier, the task of the cloud platform, in this interconnected environment, is to gather and store raw 
data coming from the controllers. Changes in data values are easily trackable by the use of a dashboard. It is also 
possible to get a timeline of when they were saved. With this additional information, we get a key-value pair allowing 
us to time track each saved value. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The IoT platform created in this paper using COTS low-cost devices brought raw data generated by analog and digital 
sensors from the edge to the cloud seamlessly. Establishing a connected infrastructure of this kind is complex but by 
defining the intended role and technical limitations of individual component such as the gateway or the controllers 
helped with the implementation of the functionalities at their respective layer. The ability to accurately assess these 
hardware and software limitations is the key factor to have a highly detailed view of the complex ecosystem. 
Visualizing each layer where value is added to the raw data and becoming a meaningful data packet greatly helps 
estimating the final informative potential of the data packet. Furthermore, the communication links used to support 
the data flows and the cloud connectivity is what defines the collaborative capacities of the entire platform. We can 
therefore demonstrate that the implementation of a connected environment combining several IoT technologies is a 
contextual task that needs a serious in-depth pre-implementation analysis of the needs. With rapidly evolving 
connected technologies, an IoT platform shouldn’t simply be deployed and forget without searching at new 
technologies which could influence today’s processes and connectivity in the near future. Once collected data reach 
the cloud, it must transform its informative potential into contextual actions within or outside the connected ecosystem.

Abstract  
 
The development of the industry forces the performance of manufacturing companies to be managed according to 
high standards at all levels such as cost, quality, and speed. Strong performing companies will generate growth in 
various aspects of global competitiveness. which ultimately affects performance in development, investment, trust 
from shareholders, In Indonesia the manufacturing industry has a very important role in economic development and 
contributed to national income by 22% in 2016 (Bank Mandiri  2018) and is also the second-largest car manufacturing 
industry in Southeast Asia. The biggest challenge today is a company not only competing with competitors who are 
different but also with the same group in various countries and even making alliances to maintain competitiveness 
carried out by Hyundai - KIA, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, etc, To gain the trust of top management so that they are 
given new model or technology, on their production systems around the world including manufacturers in Indonesia, 
this is done so that companies are competitive, one of which is in terms of optimizing the number of workers. The 
purpose of this research is to improve performance in terms of the production line at the assembly line at an automotive 
factory in Indonesia by using several actual data collection methods Line Balancing using the Yamazumi chart and 
calculation by Moodie Young  The results of this research contribute to the literature in the automotive sector. but in 
various other sectors.

1. Introduction  
The development of the Automotive industry from time to time experiences developments that force the performance 
of manufacturing companies to be managed according to high standards at all levels – cost, quality, speed, flexibility, 
reliability, delivery (Florin  2019), to be able to generate higher profitability and profit than average competitors, lower 
cost structure, better productivity, high-quality products which are the heart of the company's performance (Porter  
1985) and become one of the basic things that are of concern to many interests, including owners, employees, 
suppliers, investors to generate profits. goods or services that compete competitively in the global market (Brigham 
and Houston  2004), to gain customers earlier than their competitors (Reza  et al.  2019). 
The automotive industry in Indonesia continues to grow. The emergence of a new model, the differentiation of vehicle 
prices, and other vehicle brand make the automotive industry more competitive. (Furaida et al. 2018),and industry 
very important role in economic development contributing to national income and an attractive place for foreign 
investors to invest capital to be used as a production base (Ministry of Industry and Trade 2020), and the number of 
vehicles in Indonesia increases significantly from year to year (Irhami and Farizal  2021)  based on data for 2021, the 
Indonesian car manufacturing industry regionally in Southeast Asia occupies the second position under Thailand 
which controls about 50% of car production in the region and ranks -20 in ASIA, as shown in Table 1.

6. Conclusion 
The Line Balancing Method with Moodie Young Calculations can reduce 3 stations from a total of two Workcenters, 
so it can be said that LE has increased to 78% and 86%, but this paper has several limitations, especially in terms of 
data, it would be better if in the future using process data not only in the assembly shop but in the previous processes 
such as stamping, welding, and painting, it is hoped that in the future research with a larger scope will be carried out 
so that measurements can be more accurate and complete

Abstract 
 
Infrastructure development is massively done, but the current implementation of construction safety audit is not yet 
effective to prevent accident. Generally, the audit is limited to construction phase. Audit is rarely done in design phase, 
and if done, the audit result has never been used as reference for future audits. This research aims to formulate A 
Conceptual Framework for Knowledge Management of Integrated Design and Construction Phase Audit Process on 
Infrastructure Project Based on Risk, Using WBS, BIM and Web to Enhance Construction Safety Performance. The 
method that uses in the research is qualitative and quantitative analysis to formulate the development. And the result 
targeted A Conceptual Framework for Knowledge Management of Integrated Design and Construction Phase Audit 
Process on Infrastructure Project Based on Risk, Using WBS, BIM and Web to Enhance Construction Safety 
Performance so construction safety audit can be optimized to improve construction safety as an effort to prevent 
construction accident and mitigate infrastructure calamity during accelerated development era in Indonesia.

1. Introduction 
The current era of government is indeed the most aggressive in the development of infrastructure projects. The boost 
in massive and evenly distributed infrastructure development throughout Indonesia has received positive responses, 
especially from national and foreign business and investment circles. Infrastructure is one of the main wheels driving 
the economic growth of a nation. From the budget allocation for APBN, public, private, foreign loans, and 
assignments, infrastructure is seen as the locomotive of national development. Without consistent and growing 
infrastructure development, it is difficult for the government to increase economic growth. From the 2021 APBN 
budget, the Minister of Finance has set IDR 417 trillion, an increase of 48% from 2020. (Ministry of Finance 2021). 
The benefits of infrastructure development are, indeed, long-term, and expensive. After the Reformation, 
infrastructure development in Indonesia almost stopped instantly not only due to emergence of the multi-dimensional 
crisis in 1998, but also the government's policy at that time did not prioritize infrastructure development but post-crisis 
economic recovery. Massive infrastructure development only started again in the era of President Joko Widodo in 
2014.

information. Experts, through their background and experience, are much better equipped to connect the dots and to 
correctly assess the situation. 
 
5.17 Impact of Knowledge Management on Construction Safety Performance 
Knowledge is defined as a justified belief that increases an entity's capability for effective action, while safety is 
defined as the control of recognized hazards to attain an acceptable level of risk. Thus, safety knowledge can be 
defined as a justified belief that increases an entity's capability to effectively control the recognized hazards to attain 
an acceptable level of risk. Several researchers have addressed the importance of safety knowledge to improve 
construction safety. The creation, transfer and application of safety knowledge provide continuous feedback of what 
was learned and implements the lessons learned, which enhances the ability to perceive, recognize and control hazards. 
However, construction industry is a knowledge-rich industry in terms of the knowledge it creates the exchange among 
participants, and the information absorbed from external sources. Without an overview of the required safety 
knowledge and the associated relationships in the risk management activity, their use can be confusing (Dong et al. 
2018). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results of this study indicate that enhancing the construction safety performance in Indonesian construction 
industry, it is necessary to optimize the construction safety audit process by the development of knowledge 
management. This conceptual framework will be developed for the further research to find out the relationship 
between the variables and know the way to develop knowledge management of integrated design and construction 
phase audit process. This optimizing audit process aims to enhanced construction safety performance by integrating 
the design and construction phase audit using the development of knowledge management.

Abstract 
 
In every type of industry, the company has its own risk that threatens its business continuity and activities. The banking 
industry, which even plays a vital role in the country's economy, is not an exception to that risk. In general, businesses 
have two types of threats: natural (e.g., volcanic eruption, flood, tsunami, etc.) and human threats (e.g., sabotage, fire, 
terrorism, cybercrime, power outage, etc.). Therefore, the banking industry needs to develop a good BCP (Business 
Continuity Plan) and DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) to support its continuity and mitigate the risk that may threaten 
the business. In Indonesia, risk management for banks is regulated by The Financial Services Authority (OJK) and the 
Indonesian Central Bank (BI). This study will include applicable law by the mentioned authority, best practices for 
risk management, business continuity management standards, practiced risk policies from banks, research reports, and 
secondary sources. By analyzing the resources and data, this study will include risk scenarios, business impact 
analysis, and business continuity strategy for the banking industry. The result of this study could be used as a basis 
for developing a business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan to manage risks and recover optimally from any 
disaster or be a basis for further study on business continuity, disaster recovery, and risk management.

1. Introduction  
The banking industry is a financial industry that is critical to a country's economy and is subject to various threats. 
Some natural hazards that can disrupt the banking industry's business activities are volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, 
tsunamis, floods, and other natural disasters. In addition to natural threats, threats that humans cause include sabotage, 
fire, terrorism, cybercrime, power outages, IT (Information Technology) system failures, and disruption of data service 
providers. As a result of these disturbances, the banking industry faces eight types of risks, namely credit risk, market 
risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, and compliance risk. Banks that operate 
around the clock will not forecast when these threats will arise. As a result, banks must comprehend each threat and 
respond appropriately. As the number of transactions in both electronic and traditional banking services grows, the 
banking industry must develop a Business Continuity Plan to have good procedures in place for dealing with such 
disruptions and ensure that business can continue even when the threats occur (Chandra 2017).

6. Conclusion 
The banking industry in Indonesia cannot be separated from natural and human threats because banks in Indonesia are 
in all cities in Indonesia. Due to these threats, the banking industry faces ten kinds of risks. Therefore, a good Business 
Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan are needed to maintain the business continuity of the banking industry in 
Indonesia in the event of an unexpected disaster. To develop a good Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery 
Plan, it is necessary to identify good risks by compiling a Risk Scenario Table. After identifying the risks that could 
have an impact on the banking industry, a risk assessment needs to be carried out to find out how much impact these 
risks have on banking business processes so that the process of preparing the Business Continuity Plan and Disaster 
Recovery Plan can be carried out on target. Then after the Risk Assessment is carried out, a Business Impact Analysis 
also needs to be carried out to find out what impacts can be caused if the risk occurs and how big the effect is. After 
all the analysis is done, the preparation of a Business Continuity Plan and a Disaster Recovery Plan can be prepared. 
 
In conclusion, the Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan that we designed is if a disaster occurs, all 
employees will be transferred to a backup workplace that is not affected by the disaster. If the branch office is 
disturbed, the secondary workplace is the nearest previously determined branch office. If the head office is in a 
disaster, the employees will be transferred to the Secondary Operation Center in another bank building determined. 
And if the data center experiences a disaster, banks must prepare several backup data centers as a backup for use. 
 
In addition, this paper only provides a basic overview of the design of the banking Business Continuity Plan and 
Disaster Recovery Plan with the basic regulations applicable in Indonesia with observation and risk analysis. Each 
bank's Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan may vary according to their respective strategies and 
needs.

Abstract 
 
Despite the importance of motivation and job satisfaction, scholars have yet to identify how different types of 
motivation relate to job satisfaction. Building on self-determination theory, this study explores the relationship 
between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, job performance, creative performance, and job satisfaction. This study 
proposes job performance and creative performance as potential mediators through which intrinsic and extrinsic 
rewards relate to job satisfaction. Data collected from 166 employees in India were used to test the hypothesis. To 
accomplish this objective, a questionnaire was distributed, and these relationships were tested through Structured 
Equation Modeling using SPSS software. This study revealed that intrinsic and extrinsic rewards positively influence 
job performance. In contrast, only intrinsic rewards positively influence creative performance, and extrinsic rewards 
do not have a significant influence on creative performance. The relationship between job performance and job 
satisfaction is statistically significant, and the relationship between creative performance and job satisfaction is 
statistically significant. This paper expands the external validity of previous research results of Western samples by 
finding the positive influence of intrinsic, extrinsic rewards indirect effects on job satisfaction.

1. Introduction 
The 20th annual U.S. “Employee Benefit Trends Study” by Metlife finds that job satisfaction among U.S. workers 
has reached a 20-year low (Mseka 2022). The satisfaction of employees determines how businesses perform. Christen, 
Iyer, and Soberman (2006) state that the following factors, i.e., job performance, job-related factors, role perceptions, 
and firm performance, determine job satisfaction. When employees are committed to their organization and satisfied 
with their jobs, it may reduce the cost of absenteeism, employee turnover, and low productivity (Cherif  2020; Mizanur 
et al.  2012). 
 
Employees with higher wages, job security, and better working conditions experience greater job satisfaction. Satisfied 
employees are less likely to leave an organization, resulting in low turnover. Hence, job satisfaction is a significant 
concept in the workplace because it affects employee turnover (Javed  2014). Job satisfaction is positively correlated 
with the loyalty of employees toward their company (Martensen and Gronholdt  2001). When employees are rewarded, 
it leads to motivation and job satisfaction, which, eventually, positively affects overall performance (Bayat  2013). 
Personal characteristics such as age, gender, income, education, and experience predicted the job satisfaction of IT 
managers (Okpara  2004).

1149","Hypothesis testing results 
The results show that intrinsic rewards have a positive effect on job performance (β=.504, p≤0.001) and there is a 
significant relationship between intrinsic rewards and creative performance (β=.497, p≤0.01). Hence, hypothesis 1 
and hypothesis 2 are supported. Additionally, extrinsic rewards have a positive effect on job performance (β=.270, 
p≤0.01) and extrinsic rewards are not significantly related to creative performance (β=.081). Thus, hypothesis 3 is 
supported and hypothesis 4 is not supported. Finally, there is a significant relationship between job performance and 
job satisfaction (β=.312, p≤0.01), and creative performance is significantly related to job satisfaction (β=.235, p≤0.05). 
Hence, hypothesis 5 is supported and hypothesis 6 is supported. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Our results suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards increase job performance. This idea is supported by the 
results of various studies (Cerasoli et al.  2014; Eisenberger & Aselage  2009), which showed a positive relationship 
between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and job performance. Most previous studies have examined the effect of 
intrinsic rewards (Manzoor et al.  2021) and extrinsic rewards (Bartol & Durham  2000) separately. This study 
examines the joint effect of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards on job satisfaction via job performance and creative 
performance. 
 
The findings of this study also show that intrinsic rewards positively influence creative performance whereas extrinsic 
rewards do not have any influence on creative performance. The reason extrinsic rewards do not affect creative 
performance may be that the effect of extrinsic rewards may be dependent on personal qualities such as learning 
orientation and perceived value of rewards, and organizational factors like innovative climate. When employees are 
offered extrinsic rewards for creative performance when the task itself is not intrinsically rewarding, it may not result 
in creative performance (Choi et al.  2015). 
 
Lastly, the results show that job performance and creative performance have a positive influence on job satisfaction. 
This paper contributes to the research on the effect of rewards on job satisfaction by examining the combined effect 
of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards on job satisfaction through the mediating effect of job performance and creative 
performance.

Abstract 
 
COVID19 has a negative impact on Indonesia's economic stability, so people must help each other and share, 
particularly in the food sector. Despite having a high level of hunger, Indonesia ranks 12th in the world in terms of 
food waste production. In order to overcome this phenomenon, a user-friendly food sharing application is required. 
Hence, Kansei Engineering is used in this study to design an application to capture the user's emotional needs, as well 
as a fuzzy approach to explain the user's feature needs. Furthermore, the prototype was tested for performance and 
usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to determine the most usable design. As results, an 
application with a ""cool concept"" is a recommended design with higher efficiency and satisfaction values.

1. Introduction 
One of the most serious consequences of the COVID19 pandemic is the impact on economic stability, such as not 
being able to purchase enough food, resulting in hunger, not being able to pay for essential expenses such as rent or 
utilities, reduced income, and so on (Alzueta et al. 2021). As a result, it is critical to assist and share in order to reduce 
its impact, particularly in the case of hunger and food waste. However, there have only been a few product 
developments aimed at reducing Indonesia's high rate of hunger and food waste. According to Yanti (2021), 1.03 
billion tons of food are wasted each year. This means that 17% of food produced is wasted. Furthermore, Indonesia 
ranks 12th in the world in terms of food waste (Tiseo  2021). According to data from the BAPPENAS (National 
Research Agency) published in the Jakarta Globe (2021), Indonesia wastes an estimated 115-184 kg of food per year. 
This is sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of 61-125 million people each year. On the other hand, Indonesia, the 
world's fourth-largest country with over 250 million people, continues to suffer from hunger. According to data from 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Food Research Institute (IFPRI) in (La  2020), 22 million 
Indonesians were undernourished. In fact, according to the Global Hunger Index Team (2020)  assessment, Indonesia 
is at a moderate hunger level, ranking 70th in 2020. These phenomena must be overcome in order to achieve 
sustainable development in accordance with the United Nations Development Program's (2015) goals of zero hunger 
(number 2) and responsible consumption and production (number 12).Creating a food-sharing app that incorporates 
the user's emotional interests is one solution to this problem. User emotions and feelings can influence user experience 
in ways such as loyalty (Huff  2015; Nagamachi & Lokman  2011), attracting attention, bringing users happiness and 
satisfaction, and being more focused on customer desires (Nagamachi  1995). The Kansei Engineering method can be 
used for this approach.

1158","Figure 3. Satisfaction test result 
All generations, including Generations X, Millennials, and Y, believe that the proposed design with admirable, fresh, 
and cool concepts has an adjective rating of ""Good,"" indicating that it is suitable for use. Then, with the exception of 
the admirable concept by generation Z, all proposed designs are at the level of acceptance of ""acceptable"". This is 
because generation Z believes that displaying ""categories"" on the main page, as offered in the cool concept, will make 
learning process easier by user. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the food sharing app is built on 12 kansei words: beautiful, calm, clear, fun, futuristic, impressive, light, 
neat, refreshing, simple, sophisticated, and unique. The application design also includes five main features based on a 
fuzzy approach, namely an integrated communication system, a reward system, an integrated payment system, a 
complete food description, and a varied pick-up system. Based on the results of the prototype testing, an application 
with a ""cool concept"" is recommended because it has a higher efficiency and a better user experience.

Abstract 
 
Technological developments in the world today greatly affect the development of technology-based business models, 
one of them is E-Commerce or Electronic Commerce. The digital-based trading business is projected to increase by 
51.6 percent from 2020. The development of transactions on this online trading platform also affects businesses in the 
fulfillment or service sector, which includes a series of processes for fulfilling product orders from customers. This 
process is closely related to the parcel/expedition shipping industry. In an expedition, the process of sending goods 
from the starting point to the end point is divided into three parts, namely First Mile, Middle Mile, and Last Mile. Last 
mile delivery is a process carried out by logistics parties to send and deliver packages to recipients. Optimal hub 
locations can lead to reduced transportation costs as they directly affect the flow of goods. The purpose of determining 
a suitable location for the hub is to establish an efficient flow of goods delivery connections so that goods can be 
distributed as quickly as possible to the final recipient of the goods. Therefore, the determination of the Last mile hub 
becomes very important because it deals directly with the recipient of the goods so that it affects satisfaction with the 
services of a freight forwarder. In this study, the author uses a case study in an expedition company in Indonesia for 
the Depok area coverage and uses the Facility Location Problem method to find out the most appropriate location and 
number of hubs to cover the entire area by considering the coverage area and cost of the selected hub building. The 
optimization results are able to provide a warehouse choice solution with cheaper warehouse rental costs and cheaper 
transportation costs in specifications for a larger number of warehouses. As an example of a 10 km coverage scenario, 
providing 4 warehouses with the furthest delivery point of 9.3 km has a total cost of IDR 6,500,363,150 or 12% lower 
cost than the existing condition. With a lower furthest point, the distance and time required for parcel delivery is also 
faster and has the potential to increase customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction 
The developments of technology in the world today greatly affect the development of technology-based business 
models, as well as in Indonesia. One of the businesses that is growing thanks to technology is E-Commerce or 
Electronic Commerce. E-commerce business in Indonesia is increasing. Digital-based trading business is projected to 
increase by 51.6 percent from 2020 which reached IDR 266 trillion to IDR 403 trillion in 2021. A report released in 
October 2020 by Google, Temasek and Bain & Company discussing e-economy 2020 reported that the time used by 
people to enter online trading platforms or marketplaces during the pandemic increased by 27%. Previously people 
spent 3.7 hours/day on online trading platforms, but after the pandemic that time increased to 4.7 hours/day. 
 
The development of transactions on this online trading platform also affects businesses in the fulfillment or service

From the table above, it can be seen that the optimization results are able to provide a warehouse choice solution with 
cheaper warehouse rental costs and cheaper transportation costs in specifications for a larger number of warehouses. As 
an example of a 10 km coverage scenario, providing 4 warehouses with the furthest delivery point of 9.3 km has a total 
cost of IDR 6,500,363,150 or 12% lower cost than the existing condition. With a lower furthest point, the distance and 
time required for parcel delivery is also faster and has the potential to increase customer satisfaction. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
Optimal hub location can lead to reduced transportation costs because it directly affects the flow of goods. The purpose 
of determining a suitable location for the hub is to establish an efficient flow of goods delivery connections so that 
goods can be distributed as quickly as possible to the final recipient of the goods. Literature studies were also conducted 
to examine the Last Mile Hub, Optimization Model, Facility Location Problem, and how to verify and validate the 
optimization model. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the optimization model is able to determine 
the location of the Last Mile Hub with the lowest warehouse and transportation rental costs compared to existing 
conditions. Compared to other studies, this study uses transportation costs as one of the variables to determine and 
consider the location of the selected hub. 
 
Based on the results of the study, the following are some suggestions that can be made in further research, including 
further research to provide a function to limit warehouse capacity, take into account and optimize the number of couriers, 
consider couriers to have their own routes and not assume one-way for optimizing advanced transportation costs and 
adding recommended courier routes for further optimization of transportation costs

Abstract 
 
The Philippines have been affected by the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus disease. As a result, 
people's movements are limited, and they need to stay at home for their safety. Even if this is the case, they need supplies to 
survive, such as food, medicine, disinfectant, etc. Food delivery services are the most used service in this pandemic, and 
quarantines functioned as a catalyst for all-day eating and home cooking. Since the epidemic, people have relied on food 
delivery, considering it one of the most critical services. It keeps individuals protected from coronavirus disease outside while 
also assisting new food merchants with their latest ventures. App-based delivery services such as Food Panda, Grab Food, and 
OrderMo is often used because they are easy to use. Due to the steady increase of the consumers, the workload of food delivery 
riders is also increasing. Food delivery riders tend to be one of the front liners in this pandemic, and they are also struggling in 
their work. They need to consider their safety and health while performing this job. This study aims to assess the effect of the 
physical health struggles of Food panda delivery riders on their mental workload, providing them with a solution to their current 
situation using NASA TLX with the questionnaires provided it can present evidence on how it will make the Food Panda riders 
experience a better work environment by the assessment shows with the use of heat map, ANOVA, and correlation testing.

1. Introduction 
Ever since the pandemic started, food delivery services have become more in demand than before and have become more critical 
for business owners and their customers. It is mainly because many people just relied upon the availability and service of 
delivery riders to provide their daily needs and foods instead of them physically going out. In the Philippines, driven by 
consumer panic, this kind of service somehow becomes essential in many people, especially in those places where lockdown is 
implemented or areas with numerous Covid-19 cases. Also, since the government-imposed closure and dining-in restrictions in 
many restaurants and food and dining establishments, people tend to order from food delivery apps. For customers, they choose 
food delivery services for convenience and safety. 
 
The researchers look at the situation in the surroundings to notice the problem that needs to be recognized. Food Delivery riders, 
specifically Food Panda, experience a massive demand today as the quarantine and lockdown continue in most of the areas in 
the Philippines According to Li et al. (2020), the food delivery companies are in charge of enlightening employee’s maintenance, 
such as looking for different situations that food delivery people experience to have benefits and be safe while doing the job. 
The providers of the Food Delivery industry are accountable for the adjustments that can make the delivery riders more efficient. 
Moreover, as much as the providers want to satisfy their food delivery customers, they should not neglect their delivery people. 
To minimize delivery people leaving their jobs, they need to check if delivery people are satisfied with their jobs and working 
conditions are good. Therefore, this study shows that owners or providers of the job should consider their people as well, not 
only their consumer of the service since they are the one who’s risking their life outside to fulfill the job better. Even though 
they are the ones who applied for this job, the company of delivery riders should have considered that it will ensure their safety 
and benefits while doing the job. As they experience different physical and mental health problems, it is just right for the 
providers to maintain their health by monitoring their performance. They should also come up with various options of keeping 
their workers that will allow many riders to apply more and lessen the work responsibility that riders deal with because of lack 
of riders in the specific area as the pandemic continues, which makes this industry more in demand.

encourage employee’s comfortability. 
3. The company should conduct a physical examination when hiring their employees to 
correct and suggest the right posture that is suitable for the job 
Figure 5. Recommendation to Address Food Delivery Riders Physical Struggles 
Other Recommendation: 
1. 
The increasing number of people ordering online foods recommends that the online food delivery industry is 
continuously growing. Therefore, it also will require an increase of hiring more food delivery riders to adapt in the 
massive demand of food delivery services. 
2. 
As the food delivery riders’ demand and protest against wage policy, the company should consider the 
researchers conclusion on the struggles of the riders to reconsider their salary and improve the company 
communication line in technical issue that causes suspension of innocent riders. 
3. 
Provide a systematic procedure to follow in conducting the job that is more efficient yet considers the safety 
for the delivery riders so that the rider will be able to manage his/her time without wasting others. 
a. 
The company should set a quota of delivery per day for each delivery rider employees depending on the 
average time capacity that is suit to the delivery time of the restaurant or fast food that will still create a balance work 
time for every rider regardless the distance. 
b. 
They should properly designate the required number of delivery riders depending on the demand of the 
specific place to avoid lack and overemployed workers. 
c. 
As the riders preferred 5-8 hours of work followed by 9-12 hours, the company should openly create a 
concrete scheduling with the given 8 hours of work and a quota of 15 orders, since the open-ended questions resulted 
15 as a satisfying accepted orders by the rider that will suit with the time and distance with 30-40 minutes per order. 
Hence, the company can make it 10 hours per day for the adjusted time by late service of restaurant and other concerns 
by the customer. 
d. 
The Food Panda company can also make a specific time frame for the riders own preferred time that could 
be for morning, afternoon, and evening to midnight shift with the 10 hours requirement and 15 to 20 accepted orders 
so that the rider can choose their preferred schedule along with the company’s requirement of orders per day and these 
are the time frame per day: 
Morning: 7:00 am – 5:00 pm; Afternoon: 1:00 pm – 11:00 pm;  
Evening: 7:00 pm – 5:00 pm; Midnight: 12:00 am – 10:00 am 
e. 
Additionally, as the researchers found 5-8 hours as more preferred by the riders, the company can also make 
schedule with this time table for those who treat food delivery service as their part time job with the quota of 10 
accepted orders. With these time frame allotting 5-8 hours per day only with the adjusted time at exactly 7 hours per 
day. 
Morning: 7:00 am – 2:00 pm; Afternoon: 1:00 pm – 8:00 pm 
Evening: 7:00 pm – 2:00 am; Midnight: 12:00 am – 7:00 am

1187","4. For FoodPanda developers, to assess the delivery rider’s status every after shift, they are required to answer a 
survey about their working experience. This would help them to express their challenges and help FoodPanda company 
to 
enlighten 
the 
management 
and 
improve 
system 
of 
their 
company. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Upon evaluating the data gathered, the researchers were able to conclude the study. The respondents answered that 
the pandemic boosted the demand of their job in terms of delivery. Due to the continuous increase of the demand, 
working as a FoodPanda delivery rider caused physical struggles and mental struggles. Most of the respondents tend 
to have back pain and muscle pain as result of working hard in the pandemic. Also, the respondents suffer mental 
stress, anxiety, depression, behavioral and emotional change, and bipolar disorder while working as a FoodPanda 
delivery rider. Despite having these struggles and not well good experiences in this new normal, FoodPanda delivery 
riders rated themselves to have excellent level of mental health and physical health. 
Consequently, after quantifying the weighted average in NASA TLX questionnaire, the researchers were able to justify 
and concluded that the physical struggles experienced by food delivery riders directly contributes to their mental 
workload as the value interpreted as “very high mental workload”. Also, after utilizing various analytical tools like 
ANOVA test and correlation test, the researchers concluded that their mental workload has no significant relationship 
among the category age group and working hours. This can be interpreted in a way that despite the age of food delivery 
riders and their working schedule, their mental workloads are still high.  
Overall, it can be concluded that the current condition both physically and mentally of food delivery riders in 
CALABARZON are not stable and continuously becoming worst because of the pandemic even though the demand 
increase. Along with this, the actions and movements that food delivery companies are implementing are not enough 
to address these issues. The benefits that delivery riders currently receiving amidst pandemic is obviously not enough 
that’s why an immediate action of food delivery services company is necessary not only appropriately take good care 
of 
their 
employees 
but 
also 
for 
their 
business 
to 
continuously 
grow 
and

Abstract 
 
In the competitive car market, demand forecasting plays an important role. Accurate forecasting will provide many 
benefits to a company's supply chain process. Forecasting with past data alone is not sufficient to forecast demand. In 
other words, it takes variables that also influence demand forecasting. Through the journal review process and the 
Delphi method, seven variables are produced that affect the demand for medium-prices Toyota cars in Indonesia. 
These variables are six variables that have been used before and one variable, namely COVID-19, disrupts car demand 
in Indonesia. This study uses Multiple Linear Regression with 2018 - 2020 data, and with this model, 2021 and 2022 
demand forecasts are generated. Forecasting with this model is compared with 2021 factual data, it is found that this 
forecasting model is of good quality.

Cars as the automotive industry make a significant contribution to the Indonesian economy. (Indonesian Information 
Portal  2021) said that in recent years the contribution of the automotive sector to the national gross domestic product 
(GDP) was quite significant, which was around six percent. Figure 1. shows the total sales of cars from dealers to 
consumers in Indonesia in the last ten years.

Abstract 
 
In this paper we study the correlation between a decision-making lab experiment on a simple supply chain setting and 
several personality traits of the decision makers which are measured using out-of-experiment surveys. Our experiment 
is based on a single manufacturer – single retailer supply chain where the retailer faces random consumer demand for 
a perishable product and the manufacturer determines the contract parameters. We consider three different contract 
settings; namely wholesale price, buyback and revenue sharing contracts. We investigate the effects of self-esteem, 
regret aversion, risk aversion, loss aversion, and fairness concerns on manufacturer’s pricing decisions and retaler’s 
order quantity decisions. Despite the small sample sizes of the experiment our findings indicate that there is evidence 
for correlation between these personality traits and the contracting decisions of the subjects.

Abstract  
 
Nowadays, the implementation of stadium construction in Indonesia, either its new buildings or renovations, some of 
stadiums use an integrated design-build contract because it is considered better in terms of cost and time. However, 
the implementation of the stadium project with an integrated design-build contract has been built by the government 
still face with many problems such as schedule delays, variations of work that are not in line with the planning, cost 
overrun, claims, and disputes between owner, contractor, as well as the auditor. These problems occur because there 
are still many risks related to cost and time that have not been identified since the planning phase. Therefore, the aim 
of this study is to develop a risk-based standardized work breakdown structure (WBS) of stadium main building with 
integrated design-build contract for cost and time planning. The identification of risks that affect the planning of cost 
and time on stadium main building will be identified through an archive analysis of various related references that 
will be used for the development of the WBS stadium. The risk-based standardized WBS consists of the work package, 
method, activity, labor, material, and equipment resources. The analysis of the highest risk response that affects cost 
and time planning is conducted in order to prevent, reduce, or even eliminate potential events that can affect costs and 
time in the completion of the stadium project.

Abstract 
 
The development and competition in the automotive industry have become one of the biggest contributors to various 
pollution and waste caused by the movement of the industrial supply chain in Indonesia. Companies in the automotive 
industry are required to implement green supply chain management. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the 
application of green supply chain management in companies in the automotive industry. The study was conducted at 
a manufacturing company located in Cikarang, Jawa Barat, which is engaged in the field of car assembly, which is a 
company with fairly large car production in the Indonesian automotive industry. The population in this study are green 
procurement, green manufacturing and green logistics (inbound). The flow of the research was carried out with the 
initial steps of primary and secondary data collection, then the KPI design which would later be validated by an expert. 
After that, the AHP is weighted and then the performance is calculated using the Green SCOR method. The results 
showed there were 22 KPIs which became the basis for calculating Green SCOR. The results of the Green SCOR for 
GSCM obtained amounted to 65,819 where according to the monitoring system table the work indicators are included 
in the ""Average"" category. Therefore, there are still lot of room for improvement. Improving the performance of green 
supply chain management by implementing proposed improvements will have a good impact on green supply chain 
management as a whole.

1. Introduction 
Awareness will be the importance of the role of Supply Chain Management in improving the company's performance 
continues to increase from year to year. Over time, each company increasingly focused on the performance of the 
components in the supply chain and also the collaboration between the actors contained in the supply chain. Movement 
of the supply chain has some adverse impacts on the surrounding environment. Pollution, garbage, waste, and other 
hazards to the environment often occur when the flow and supply chain processes take place. Srivastava (2007) defines 
green supply chain management as the integration of environmental thinking into supply chain management, including 
product design, material purchasing and supplier selection, manufacturing processes, delivery of end products to 
consumers, and also product management after their useful life. Green supply chain management slowly began to 
enter the realm of the automotive industry in Indonesia, several companies have implemented green supply chain 
management in the supply chain they live. The study was conducted on one company in the automotive industry which 
is engaged in assembling cars from Japan. The application of the green concept into the automotive industry is very 
important to reduce environmental impact, compete in market competition, and ensure compliance with regulations. 
Based on data from the ASEAN Automotive Federation, Indonesia is the second largest car manufacturer in Southeast 
Asia after Thailand with a total production of 1,286,848 units in 2019 before the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 that 
attacked all countries in the world (ASEAN AUTOMOTIVE FEDERATION   2021). Based on the description above, 
it can be concluded that the problem that occurs is the presence of various pollution and waste caused by the movement 
of industrial supply chains in Indonesia, where the automotive industry is one of the biggest contributors to the adverse 
impact on the environment. The concept of green supply chain management must be continuously evaluated in order 
to continue to develop, so it is necessary to measure the output generated from supply chain activities. These 
measurements are related to performance at each stage of the supply chain. The phrase ""you can't manage what you 
can't measure"" is associated with various sources and has become an important business maxim today (Grant & Shaw

1206","A recent study from Ajinkya (2021) proposed a Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) with an example of 
plastic bucket packaging that integrates the process of collecting and recovering plastic bucket packages 
with a finished product supply chain. Plastic bucket reverse logistics consists of phases such as 
recovering used buckets from the point of demand, sorting them for reusable parts, and disposing of non-
reusable parts. Lastly, the processing of recovered parts to recover raw materials (plastic granules) which 
can be reused to make materials for the manufacture of buckets. 
5. Provide regular training to employees regarding the implementation of Green Supply Chain in the 
company. 
A study conducted by Nejati et al. (2017), investigated the relationship between green human resource 
management and green supply chain management, considering the moderating effect of employee 
resistance to change. Based on a sample of 161 companies in the manufacturing industry in Iran, the data 
were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation (PLSSEM) model. The results show a 
significant and positive impact of GHRM (Green Human Resources Management) on GSCM, 
confirming the integration between HRM and green management; “Green Development and Training”, 
“Green Employee Empowerment”, and “Green Pay and Rewards” have the most positive influence on 
GSCM. 
6. Provide conditions for suppliers to implement energy saving and environmental protection. 
Improving Energy Efficiency is an operational challenge and a strategic opportunity for suppliers. The 
study of Wu et al. (2014) is an initial step in examining the role of buyers in influencing supplier 
decisions to implement Energy Efficiency initiatives as they seek to balance cost pressures with energy 
conservation demands that arise from governments and buyers. Currently, brand image related to the 
environment is one of the customer's considerations in choosing a product, so that the requirements for 
suppliers in implementing energy and environmental protection is one of the important things to do 
because it can have a broad effect on the environmental impact of the supply chain. 
7. Implementing energy saving in the factory internally by minimizing energy consumption. 
The increase in energy costs due to increasing demand and its limited availability has resulted in 
increased production and transportation costs which in turn can increase the costs of the entire supply 
chain. In response to this, Shrouf et al. (2014) suggested a production model to minimize the cost of 
energy consumption by optimizing the length of the production cycle. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The conclusions generated based on this research there are 22 KPIs related to the implementation of Green Supply 
Chain Management in the Indonesian automotive industry based on the results of literature studies and case studies of 
PT. XYZ, which is one of the largest car manufacturers in Indonesia, has also been validated by experts. The results 
of the Green SCOR for the Green Supply Chain obtained are 65.819 where according to the work indicator monitoring 
system table included in the ""Average"" category, there are 7 KPIs that are included in the poor category. Therefore, it 
is necessary to propose improvements to KPIs that are included in the poor and marginal categories. Proposed 
improvements or proposed strategies related to improving the implementation of green supply chain management 
which includes green procurement, green production and green logistics, namely holding training related to Green 
Supply Chain Management or Green Training for suppliers tailored to customer/customer needs, implementing new 
energy use renewable energy sources such as installing solar cells as an energy source to replace conventional energy 
in stages, conducting periodic audits of suppliers regarding the implementation of GSCM in general using third party 
auditors, forming collaborative projects with companies that can recycle plastic packaging materials, providing regular 
training to workers related to the implementation of Green Supply Chain in the company, providing conditions for 
suppliers to implement energy savings and environmental protection and finally implement energy savings in internal 
factory by minimizing energy consumption.

Abstract 
 
The critical failure factors (CFFs) affecting the premature closure of microbusinesses (MBs) remain an understudied 
field in the scientific community. This led to the prevalent issue of rapid and continuous failure rate among MBs which 
necessitates the need to produce more studies to aid this sector considering its implications for employment generation, 
idea innovation, and an overall increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) in a country. This paper focuses on the 
investigation of the importance ratings of the linkage and driving CFFs across the food and clothing industry in Cebu 
City, Philippines. Using a Mann-Whitney U-test, the key results showed there no exist a significant difference in the 
importance rating of the CFFs between the two MB types. In addition, the statistical analysis showed a higher mean-
rank of importance rating in the food industry compared to the clothing industry. This concludes that policymakers 
need not to further introduce a specific government program depending on the MB type. Furthermore, more emphasis 
should be geared towards the food MBs considering that it establishes a higher mean-rank rating in the CFFs and are 
therefore more prone to premature closures.

1. Introduction 
Microbusinesses (MBs) are the smallest sector in the field of businesses, yet these are the greatest contributors to a 
country’s gross domestic product (GDP) (Obi et al. 2018). Despite its contributions, this research domain remains 
rather an infant, thus, the prime problem of premature closure is still not addressed in the literature.  To begin with, 
the world has many different definitions of MBs depending on the country, state, or region due to variations in the 
legislation (Manzoor et al. 2021). For one, the Small Business Administration (SBA) defines MBs as enterprises that 
have 1-9 employees. This definition can also differ in any state or locality, for instance, the state of Vermont, the 
United States of America (USA) defines MBs as a business that has at most five employees that generate $25,00 in 
annual revenue, while some are owned by sole-proprietors that have no employees (Murray). In another state, MBs 
are composed of up to 10 or fewer employees (Devins  1999; Kangasharju  2000). On the other hand, in a developing 
country such as the Philippines, the term MBs are commonly known as Barangay MBs in the Republic Act No. 9178, 
known as the Barangay Micro Business Enterprises (BMBEs) Act of 2002,  can be defined as any business entity 
engaged in the operations of commodities, which includes but are not limited to agri-business, trade, and services, 
with a total declared assets, including loans, of at most Php 3,000,000.00 (i.e., exclusive of the land wherein the MB 
is situated) with its common example – the sari-sari store (A Guide to Starting a Micro Business in the Philippines, 
2002).  
 
Although the capital and gross revenues of MBs are small in comparison to medium and big enterprises, their existence 
displayed overall contributions in terms of improving a country’s quality of life and socio-economic development 
(Erdin & Ozkaya  2022). Their contribution is highlighted in a study in Ethiopia wherein, MBs contributed through 
employment creation, poverty alleviation, and living standards improvement (Endris  2022). Evidence from data 
presented showed that MBs are significant drivers of economic development in transition economies such as Nigeria 
and other transitional economies globally (Obi et al.  2018). The study encourages government entities to further 
encourage initiative programs directed at existing MBs as well as the creation of new MBs to help sustain the economic

1218","6. Conclusion 
This paper takes into account the premature closure of MBs given the vital role of this business entity in increasing a 
country’s GDP. The focus of this paper reels into the CFFs affecting the premature closure of MBs due to how this 
area remains understudied in the scientific community. To advance this significant research gap in the literature, a 
statistical analysis is performed among the importance ratings of the linkage and driving factors affecting the 
premature closures of MBs. The statistical analysis tool utilized is a Mann-Whitney U-Test in comparing the mean 
rank of the CFFs across various types of MBs. Moreover, the paper investigates the relevance of policymakers’ having 
a general, non-specific government program in aiding the operations of MB owners. 
 
The key results of this paper concluded there is no significant difference in the importance ratings of the CFFs affecting 
the premature closure of MBs regardless of the business type. This finding implies that owners’ perceptions of the 
CFFs across various types of MBs are of the same impact in terms of their success or failure. In the Philippines’ 
setting, the government’s current practices of implementing general programs to aid all MB types is a favorable 
response to combat the problem of premature closure. To further expound, the mean-ranking of the importance ratings 
showed key results wherein MB owners of food businesses rank significantly higher in importance ratings to factor-
to-factor comparison against MB owners of clothing businesses. The higher mean-rank rating in the food industry 
implies that this sector is more prone to the effects of the CFFs and should be allotted more aid and resources by the 
government to reach success and avoid premature closures. This is attributed to the food industry being the most 
competitive type of MB due to their products being considered a basic commodity and are fast-moving in nature. 
 
This paper exhibits the following limitations and probable research expansions for future studies. For one, the types 
of MBs can consider more than two types aside from the food and clothing industries (e.g., technology, service, agri-
business, among others). Having more than two types of MBs considered can be investigated by means of a k-factor 
statistical analysis. This investigation would provide insights into whether similar key results can be derived in 
retaining the null hypothesis that there exists no statistical difference in the importance ratings across multiple types 
of MBs. For another, the core of this paper may also be reproduced in a case study involving another environment, 
given that the definition of MBs differs from its state or country of origin, declared gross annual income, and total 
assets. This could potentially generate a significantly different result and would introduce more avenues for further 
research.

Abstract 
Food allergens are proteins that are present in the food in significant amounts, they survive food processing 
environments.  The risk caused by food allergens has increased in the last 20 years and it continues to 
expand. Food intolerances and food allergies are now well-known as a food safety concern, which must be 
succeeded. In the food industry, consideration of the risk caused by allergenic foods remains unpredictable. 
Managing this allergic risk would benefit from a better consistency of allergen management, practices and 
methods.   One of the basic human rights, is to have access to safe food and it is of paramount importance 
that food is accurately labeled in appropriately.   Food allergy have recently become a worldwide health 
concern.  Food allergy is a result of an abnormal immune response to certain types of food proteins that 
may lead to an adverse health reaction and can cause death. In the study, allergen Bradford test was 
conducted on rinsed water of Diosna Mixers after production. The goal was to determine the organization 
effectiveness and efficiency of their allergen food management system. The results for products that 
entailed whew powder and soya as one of the ingredients list, showed traces of protein concentrations. The 
concentrations were compared with acceptable allergen limits listed on regulations R. 146 and R. 293. It is 
important that manufacturing industries not only comply with food management regulations but to ensure 
a robust allergen management plan.

1. Introduction 
Food borne diseases causes severe symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pains. These symptoms 
are experienced by people who consumed contaminated foods and every year, millions of people get harmfully 
affected by the food they consume (Thomas, 2007; Newell, 2010 et al). The major causes of deaths, hospitalizations 
and illnesses are parasites, viruses, toxins and bacteria. There is a requirement for international and national food 
safety approaches to mitigate these hazards and to ensure sure that the suitability of food for human consumption 
traces back to the 1960s (British Retail Consortium, 2013). 
Food industries have created significant efforts in putting into operations proper allergen risk management practices. 
Since these practices are reducing unintentional exposure of allergic consumers to allergens, this has improved the 
spread of advisory labelling throughout the world. Advisory labelling on likely cross-contact with allergens is

analysis.

5.8 Validation  
According to the results found in the verification and validation methods, it shows that product 3 and 8 significantly 
differ from other production, this is due to the ingredients used in each production (see appendix). The result obtained 
from the statistical analysis shows that cluster analysis agrees with Pearson correlation, linear scattered plot analysis. 
Also, the relationship between studied products indicate that P8 is independent of other products.  
The results also conclude that the cleaning method for this facility is poor and needs to be amended based on allergen 
used in production. This research has also proven that there is a gap between South African regulations, manufactures 
and consumers. The regulations are amended and communicated; it is the manufactures role to ensure that this 
information is attained but small food manufactures are clueless on the existence of most food management systems.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Allergens are naturally present from food that we eat, in the past years allergens were not known and their health 
hazards remained unnoticed until consumer eating patterns were traced back. Most children deaths were due to 
allergic reactions and no one knew how to prevent such a horrific cause. It was later discovered that consumers need 
to be informed with what they are eating from restaurants to retail stores. Food labelling was the main cause of 
allergic reactions and food manufactures need to be informed on such cases. 
The research was conducted in a flavor industry that supplies raw materials to final manufacturers in the food chain. 
Allergen samples were taken within the facilities production area after eight successful production and cleaning 
procedures were complete. The allergen concentrations were measured using the verification and validation 
methods. Both methods depicted that the third and eighth products had significant presence of allergen proteins. 
This was due to the high quantities of whey and soya powder used in the ingredients and how the cleaning methods 
were not effective. 
This research also found that the mechanical energy of cleaning workforce significantly decreases near closing 
business hours. The cleaning protocols must be visited, and sampling time must also be changed. The statistical 
results show that the last production significantly differed from other products. This was the due to the ingredient 
whey and soya used in the manufacturing of this product.

Abstract 
 
The increase in carbon emissions by the transportation sector is correlated with the rise in the number of vehicles in 
Indonesia, especially vehicles with internal combustion engines which reaches at least 30% of the total national carbon 
emissions. Carbon emissions cause environmental damage, prompting the Indonesian government to implement a 
carbon emission policy on ICE vehicles, and the adoption of electric-based vehicle. However, the customers' adoption 
rate is still limited, partly due to the limited choice of electric vehicles products in Indonesia and unit prices, which 
are still relatively expensive. This paper intends to explore the design of electric vehicles by paying attention to 
customer needs to obtain product designs that are most in-demand and most likely to be realized by the related industry. 
For this purpose, the integration of conjoint analysis (based on full combination model) and environmentally conscious 
quality function deployment (QFD) methods is carried out, helpful in connecting customer aspects with technical 
aspects in the automotive industry. The research was conducted by exploring nine attributes and 30 levels of product 
design variations covering performance, technology, and service aspects of electric vehicle such as maximum power 
and torque; maximum range; vehicle model; battery capacity; battery charging speed; expected battery life; technology 
features and vehicle price. 32 design variation obtained which combining nine attributes and 30 product design level. 
Through environmentally conscious quality function deployment (ECQFD) method, the product design obtained is 
realized as a production strategy to obtain an electric vehicle design that best suits customers' preferences.

1. Introduction 
Climate change and carbon emissions have become the most worrying environmental problems in recent decades. 
Various policies and strategies were taken to address these problems, considering how severe the impacts have been. 
The consequence is changing the trend of foil-driven motorized vehicles to electric vehicles. Manufacturers, 
governments, and society consider that using electric vehicles can significantly reduce carbon emissions worldwide. 
As one of the largest automotive markets in Asia, Indonesia occupies an important position in reducing carbon 
emissions where the number of motorized vehicles is correlated with the amount of carbon produced. In Indonesia, 
carbon emissions are dominated by the transportation sector, which accounts for 30% (or more than 120,000 GG) of 
national annual carbon emissions and is estimated to grow by 7.17% annually (Institute for Essential Services Reform, 
2020). This prediction is even more worrying considering the rapid growth in the number of motorized vehicles in 
Indonesia, primarily passenger vehicles with internal combustion engines. Based on the report, in 2020, there were at 
least 15,797,746 units of ICE passenger vehicles (GAIKINDO  2021). 
 
The adoption of electric vehicles in the world is nothing new. However, the rate of BEV adoption in Indonesia tends 
to be low compared to other countries, such as the United States of America, which, in 2021, will adopt 434,879 
electric vehicles from 1,236,429 new vehicles that year (Jin 2022). At least 400,000 electric vehicles will be used in 
the United Kingdom by 2021 (Powell, 2022). In comparison, in the same year, the public only adopted 488 electric 
vehicles (GAIKINDO, 2021). It must be acknowledged that various factors influence people's interest in electric 
vehicles, Indonesia, in particular, the price difference between conventional vehicles and electric vehicles is still high. 
Moreover, Indonesians still think that using electric vehicles does not have a practical economic value. This thought 
is quite reasonable if you look at the fact that the cost of maintaining electric vehicles, especially batteries, is at least

several product options that meet the criteria determined based on ECQFD Phase I and Phase II. The improvement 
target can be chosen from the priority of the selection of parts obtained from table 6 above. In this case, the 
improvement target chosen can be improvising the battery safety system, gearbox, battery packs; AC motors; vehicle 
chassis; safety system so on, until the last one is the AC motor controller. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
In tables 5 & 6, several things must be considered in designing an electric vehicle that reflects consumer desires based 
on table 3. The intended design target can be seen in the voice of customer section in table 5. Technical response in 
table 5 can be adjusted to each situation -respective manufacturers refer to local government regulations. The types of 
improvisations that can be made refer to the technical response in table 5. For example, if the improvisation chosen is 
a vehicle chassis, it is then related to the overall weight of the chassis, materials that can be recycled, then the volume 
and amount of energy required for chassis production. If battery improvisation is chosen, then what can be done refers 
to the overall weight of the battery, toxicity, volume, number of parts, physical lifetime, rate of recycled materials, 
and others. These references can finally be used as a benchmark to determine the type of material used as a battery 
pack. The preparation of the parts in table 6 is carried out with the help of practitioners of the electric vehicles industry 
in Indonesia, which can then be developed and adapted to certain types of parts. In this process, more contributions 
from electric vehicles industry practitioners are needed to realize more accurate results. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the research conducted, several conclusions were obtained, namely: 
1. Application of conjoint analysis can be used as input in the voice of consumer section in the ECQFD, and 
the relative importance of the results of the conjoint analysis can be used as input for the planning matrix 
stage; 
2. Conjoint analysis can be an instrument that bridges the interests of consumers and industry, especially in 
the design of electric vehicles; 
3. Electric vehicles that best represents consumer desires has the following specifications: MPV model; 
maximum range of 450 km; maximum battery capacity 40-50 kWh; charging time DC/AC 40-50 minutes/5 
hours; max power 300 hp; max torque 250 Nm; expected battery life 20 years/320,000 km; equipped with 
advance driving assistance system with an estimated price of 500 million rupiahs; 
4. Integration of conjoint analysis with ECQFD provides an electric vehicles design execution guide which 
has two advantages, namely reflecting consumer desires and at the same time realizing electric vehicles as 
environmentally conscious products.

Abstract 
 
This study applies lean management approaches in grinding wheel production, such as value-stream mapping, quick 
changeover, and line balancing to decrease lead time, work-in-process, changeover time, and increase quality and 
productivity. Customer orders of grinding wheel products have the characteristics of low volume and wide variety 
while the production process is labor-intensive as well. Among all processes of grinding wheel production, the mixed 
process and burned process are the most time-consuming steps, any unexpected breakdown will significantly decrease 
available capacity and lead to bottleneck in production, which causes additional cost. By illustrating the As-Is model 
of value-stream mapping after collecting production system information and analyzing the current state of 
manufacturing production, we set the goal for improvement. After implementing capacity balance improvements and 
importing the quick changeover method, the To-Be model was developed to evaluate the improvement by reducing 
non-value-adding waste, including waiting, transportation and inventory. This research combines theory and practical 
applications, hoping to effectively improve grinding wheel production to increase production effectiveness and 
efficiency, therefore enhancing the competitiveness of the traditional manufacturing industry.

Abstract 
 
Currently, Bangladeshi surgeons approach surgeries by observing 2D reports or very often 3D photographic views of 
the affected body parts to assume a 3D construction of that body part, which is surely a difficult process and also may 
lack in assumption sometimes. Most often, students in operation theatre (OT) being large in number fails to understand 
the surgical procedures due to the lack of proper visualization. Even due to not having a sufficient level of experience, 
they don’t get the chance to perform any practice surgery, so they have to learn only by visualization, which is 
definitely a long-time process. Moreover, medical students sometimes face financial problems in buying costly human 
bones. To get rid of these shortcomings, this study aims to introduce the manufacturing of patient-specific 3D printed 
models. Proper application of this technology will work as an aid to be able to provide low budget 3D printed human 
bones required for educational purposes, increase the learning proficiency of medical students by giving them chances 
to perform practice surgeries and also lessen patient’s intraoperative bleeding time, anaesthetic exposure and heat loss 
through proper pre-surgical planning by surgeons as the outcome of practice surgery, which will lead to achieving a 
higher satisfaction level of the patients that promises to change the current medical scenario of Bangladesh 
tremendously.

1. Introduction 
The very concept of additive manufacturing can be owed to the success of 3D printing. It has utility in both the 
engineering and the medical sector. 3D printing is utilized for patient-specific simulations to enhance interactive 
results and this concept is being evolved as a mainstream tool. The objective is to reduce patient bleeding time, 
anesthetic exposure, heat loss, etc. Medical fields have seen a rapid use of this technology in instances like plastic 
surgery, orthopedics, and dentistry. For its expertise in producing real-life look-alike of objects, it can provide the 
clinicians with a tangible structure to examine patient-specific anatomy and pre-plan surgical procedures without 
having direct inspection of the patient. Patient-specific individualized simulation can be feasible for the treatment of 
complex diseases. It can enable the surgical team to plan and practice beforehand, predict the complications that may 
arise during the surgeries and take necessary precautions. 3D printed models also have the added benefit of being 
more anatomically precise than cadavers or animals, thus helping accurate learning. This system is increasing the 
possibility of successful outcomes, cost-effectiveness and time management, enhanced opportunities to gain 
experiences through learning proficiency, and above all providing security to human lives. Bangladesh is yet to adapt 
to the technology of patient-specific 3D printing. We are still clinging to the traditional, conventional methods of 
operation theatre which result in a great loss of time, cost efficiency and effort. The target of this study is to design a

The customer may get service and leave the system in less than 7 days. It can be said that the time required to provide 
the service is quite optimum. (See Appendix 1). 
 
6.3 Longevity 
PLA may endure up to 15 years. So, definitely in terms of longevity along with the cost, it is obviously a better choice. 
 
7. Future Scope 
Future works include practical implementation of the proposed patient-specific three-dimensional human bone 
production, which if accepted wholeheartedly then one day it will radically change the health care system of 
Bangladesh and revolutionize modern surgery to an unimaginable level. 
 
8. Conclusion 
To provide a solution to the current problems, this paper presents calculations of cost and time regarding 3D printed 
bones. Also, the manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs were incorporated to get the final cost tables from the 
perspective of Bangladesh. This proposes to integrate 3D printing of different bones and a dummy web page to provide 
the facility among doctors and medical students in practical. This system is evaluated using a simulation model created 
in ARENA simulation software to get the capacity result.  Again, the business side of this 3D printing systems 
compared by calculating unit product cost incurred in production. Finally, after evaluation of the implementation of 
this technology, the results indicate that incorporating this system in the real-life scenario may bring a huge 
development to the medical sector as well as to the country. The proposed web page model not just presents another 
plan of action to provide 3D printed bones, but additionally gives a promising approach to deal with the existing 
problems in Bangladesh and opening a new source to the manufacturing society in the near future.

Abstract 
The world of marketing is very dependent on consumer satisfaction which will affect consumer loyalty, where 
consumers always play an important role on the spearhead of the business continuity of marketers or companies. 
Marketers or companies need to pay attention to consumer loyalty as an important factor for the success of selling 
both goods or services offered to consumers. Consumers who are satisfied with the quality of the product, both goods 
and or services, will be loyal and refer to other potential customers, so as to create synergy in a product marketing 
chain. This study focuses on comparing consumer loyalty from two well-known marketplaces in Indonesia, namely 
Shopee and Tokopedia. Generally, consumer loyalty from the marketplace business depends on the promotion system 
offered by the marketplace. The more intense the promotions offered by the marketplace, the more it will provide a 
catalyst for consumers to stay loyal and loyal to shopping on the marketplace page.

Abstract 
 
Positive psychology emphasizes positive well-being leading to a flourishing life with meaning. Teachers’ well-being 
plays a central role in teachers’ performance and achievement of students. Teachers’ well-being，recognized as 
teaching work related well-being，refers to teacher’s positive evaluations of and healthy functioning in their work 
environment and teachers self efficacy refers to a judgment of teachers ’capabilities to bring about desired outcomes 
of student engagement and learning. Objective in this study is to test empirically the influence of teacher well-being 
(TWB) and Teachers’ Sense of efficacy (TSE) as predictors among college teachers in Ningxia of China. Instruments 
involved are Teacher Well-being Scale (Collie, 2015) and Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale (Tschannen-Moran, M., 
2001). Findings show that the coefficient between TWB and TSE is 0.276; Meanwhile, a regression analysis between 
TWB and TSE is also employed to confirm the influence of TSE toward TWB. The research results indicated that 
there is a significance in the linear regression analysis (P<0.001), presenting a positive correlation between teachers’ 
well-being and teachers self efficacy in this region. In this survey, sample of 400 teachers from the western part of 
China---Ningxia Region yielded the above result. Positive personal traits such as self efficacy can contribute to 
teacher-well-being. Promoting teacher well-being not only enhances teaching quality but also has a significant follow-
on effect in cultivating students’ perception of well-being, even in scaffolding their future development such as 
emotional expression, motivation, and academic achievement, as well as promoting teacher’ sense of efficacy.

1. Introduction  
Clearly, college teacher well-being(TWB)plays a central role in higher education. Teachers have higher influence on 
achievement of students than any other variable, including social status, race, and parenting (Hammond and Haselkom 
2009).Besides academic achievements, teacher occupational well-being can also devote to some concrete positive 
consequences to students psychological such as  the impact on students’ perception of well-being. Surely promoting 
positive emotions and well-being for teachers not only affects teaching quality & effect and but also has a significant 
follow-on effect in cultivating  college students’ well-being even in scaffolding their development. Researches show 
employees who are satisfied with their jobs tend to show higher performance levels at work (Shenghua Huang et al.  
2019). Accordingly, teachers can exhibit greater teaching abilities with higher job satisfaction. When college teachers 
experience higher level of well-being positive emotion, it would be more likely that a more positive balance emerge 
in their lives with diminished various job-related stressors. Consequently, not only will college teachers themselves 
benefit a lot from high level of well-being, but also their students will too.

To conclude, teacher-well-being can contribute to positive personal traits such as self efficacy. Promoting teacher 
well-being not only enhances teaching quality but also has a significant follow-on effect in cultivating  college teacher’ 
self efficacy, even in scaffolding their future development The researchers hope this paper will end with an outlook 
for future research  in this domain.Hopefully, this research can add to the very limited literature on the college teacher 
well-being &self efficacy literature, even provide reference for later researchers or their counterparts in other areas.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the impact of empowering employee performance on the Covid-19 pandemic and 
knowing the methods of empowering employee performance against the Covid-19 pandemic. In the methodology 
there are 8 steps to achieve the results according to the research objectives, these steps include: formulate the problem, 
develop and validate the review protocol, search the literature, screen for inclusion assess quality, extract data, analyze 
and synthesize data and report findings. The research results show that Covid-19 has had a very bad impact on the 
economy, including in the employee performance sector. In the short term, many countries implement strict quarantine 
policies, economic activity becomes very limited. The long-term consequences of this pandemic lead to many layoffs, 
so that mass unemployment and business failures will occur, this triggers the emergence of psychological disorders 
that can disrupt the mental health of individual employees so that it also affects employee performance. The fact is 
that it shows a linear pattern between economic instability and the increasing level of psychological disorders felt by 
individuals. Many companies implement work from home, which is a change in work activities experienced by all 
companies during the Covid-19 pandemic, this change is proven through the work system of employee performance 
which is strongly influenced by work facilities and infrastructure factors, employee monitoring in operating online 
applications and the accuracy of the collection of work results in accordance with the plan. If the company optimizes 
employee performance results, then the company's system is likely to experience no operational disruptions and 
company revenues.

1. Introduction 
The phenomenon of globalization is having a major impact on food systems around the world. Food 
systems are changing, resulting in greater availability and diversity of food, although access to this food is 
universal by no means. Many of these changes are closely associated with urbanization, increasing incomes, 
market liberalization and foreign direct investment. Competition for a market share of food purchases tends to 
intensify with entry into the system of powerful new players such as large multinational fast food and supermarket 
chains (Schultz 2004). The fast food industry is on in an upward trend. The demand for fast food product is now 
growing as it is convenience which suits the lifestyle of customers (Nezakati, Kuan, and Asgari 2011). Fast food 
typically refers to food that is quickly prepared, purchased in self-service from restaurants with precooked 
ingredients, and served in a packaged form to the customer to take-away such as burgers, French fries, and pizza 
(Lin and Frazao 1997). Fast food first popularized in the 1970s in the United States, which has today the largest 
fast food industry in the world (AlFaris et al. 2015). The fast-food industry is now more global than ever and 
international fast-food consumption continues to increase in popularity. As is the case with any product, customers 
form perceptions of fast-food outlets. These perceptions may be formed by word-of-mouth communication, 
exposure to promotion from fast-food restaurants, past personal experience, and other sources (Kara, Kaynak, and 
Kucukemiroglu 1997). Culture and international marketing of food services are strategically intertwined. While 
international fast food consumption continues to increase in popularity (Kara, Kaynak, and Kucukemiroglu 1997). 
It has also been noted that “the act of food consumption is one which is closely related to cultural and ethnic 
identification” (Keillor and Fields 1996). There are a lot of fast-food outlets in the world (David H.C 2020). 
Subway is the leader in terms of the number of outlets with 42,998 locations, followed by McDonald’s by 37,200 
locations and Starbucks by 30,000 locations respectively (“The World’s Largest Fast Food Restaurant Chains - 
WorldAtlas.Com” n.d.). 
 
From Table 1, it can be concluded that there are more than 250,000 fast food outlets that have been 
trending in the world, and even in Indonesia. In Indonesia, there are several fast food outlets that are quite popular 
among the public like, McDonald, KFC, Burger King, A&W, Pizza Hut and many others. However, most fast 
food enthusiasts are middle class and teenagers (Ratnasari 2017). Specifically, in Indonesia, there are 28,4 million 
visitors in Sederhana Restaurant, 24 million visitors in KFC, and 7,7 million visitors in McDonald’s (Wahyono 
2019). Over 12 million people living in the jakarta metropolitan area (Jabodetabek), or 59% of the area's 
population, visit a fast food restaurant in an average of six months (David H.C 2020). Quote from (“Bisnis 
Restoran Cepat Saji Berpeluang Tumbuh 15% Tahun Ini - Ekonomi Bisnis.Com” n.d.) that the fast-food industry 
growing steadily and better over time, the industry has estimated growth from 10% to 15% every year. Many 
people switch from foods that depend on the season, mostly sourced from plants (vegetable) and rich in fiber to 
foods that are high in carbohydrates, sugars, fats, and salt. They expect practicality in providing food and easy to 
get from anywhere. (Hartono 2019). Even in Indonesia though, they continue to consume these foods. In fact, as

Abstract 
 
Project management is a very important factor for success or failure, about 12% of projects in the industry were 
destined to fail according to studies by the Project Management Institute. Therefore, it is relevant to know the 
scientific/technological evolution about the use of good practices, models and trends in project management that lead 
to a successful implementation result to identify relevant findings that allow improving specific work approaches. 
This article presents a systematic literature review that analyzes 98 articles in English language within the period from 
2011 to 2021 from three main databases of high relevance (Scopus, Taylor & Francis and SpringerLink), where a 
taxonomy involves the type of article, the origin, the validation methods, business unit, the level of implementation 
of the proposals and the degree of new approaches for reference frameworks is analyzed. 
 
The results and findings of this article will allow to detect areas of opportunity that contribute to indicators of scientific 
production at the academic level and allows for future approaches to be made in the manufacturing industry of the 
bajio area in Mexico, adapting frameworks models according to their requirements.

1. Introduction 
 
The project life cycle are the phases or stages that a project goes through from its beginning to its end. A project phase 
is defined as the set of project activities, logically related, culminating in the completion of one or more deliverables, 
these can be sequential, iterative, or overlapping (Project Management Institute, 2017). 
According to () projects are divided into different phases to make administration and control more efficient. Together, 
these phases are called the project life cycle. According to (Turkulainen, et al., 2014) the first research on project 
management is between 1930 and 1950 where the terms of projects and programs were used as oneself. Likewise, the 
author emphasizes focusing on the basic terms of program and project management, as well as the differences between 
them, describing the definition of program as a set of projects, aimed at concentrating all the activities required to 
achieve a set of important benefits.

1299","6. Conclusion  
The development of this review of systematic literature related to the management and administration of projects in 
the scientific and technological field, allows us to have an overview of their evolution over 10 years, where it is 
possible to identify areas of opportunity on fields of study of greater relevance, as well as the behavior and use of 
certain research techniques; mainly the results obtained guide the construction of new proposals for both research 
and technical application, as the indices of application of reference frameworks for solving particular problems are 
glimpsed. 
 
As part of the results of this analysis, we can highlight the great diversity of areas of implementation on the 
management and administration of processes, the search period shows us that the most recent contributions have been 
focused on relevant issues with the environment, followed by information technologies. It is even detected that in 
Mexico there is no significant progress in the management and administration of projects, as well as the proposal of 
published frameworks that can be used under the characteristics and needs of the projects of the Mexican industry, 
thus leaving a great area of opportunity for research and the creation of articles that allow to offer a more tropicalized 
approach. In this same context, it can be noted that a large part of the contributions tends to use case studies as a means 
of validation for the proposed approaches, taking as a reference that (United States) contributes to a greater extent 
with relevant publications.

Abstract 
 
The internet provides benefits that are encountered by the wider community as a development in the business world from 
now to the future and continues to color digital economic activities. Selling products on the internet will certainly change 
the way marketing purchases are made. With the rapid development of science and technology, it is used by business 
service providers to develop their business. In order to compete with other service providers, business people continue 
to improve quality to attract consumer buying interest. Currently, there are many studies examining the effect of quality 
on interest in buying food on the Shopee and Gojek applications. So it is necessary to review journal papers that discuss 
interest in buying food on the Shopee and Gojek applications. The method used in this research is the Systematic 
Literature Review (SLR) of journal papers published from 2016-2019. There is a research Question (RQ) set in this 
study. The final results obtained from this research are the names of the features of the online food buying application, 
namely Shopee Food and Go Food, the factors that influence consumer food buying interest in the Shopee Food 
application and the Go-Food application are seen from the advantages and promotions and vouchers that the application 
provides, and there is a difference between people's buying interest in the Shopee Food application and the Go-Food 
application seen from the needs and purchasing ability of consumers. The results obtained in this study are expected to 
provide information so that the two applications studied continue to maintain excellence and improve service quality so 
as to increase consumer buying interest.

Based on Research Question 3 about interest buy public on application Shopee Food and the Go-Food application can 
be seen in the RQ3 table regarding the advantage table application. Known that interest buy public on both application 
which researched naturally different, judging by the advantages of each application they offer to users consumer. In 
addition to the advantages, each application has disadvantages that make it interesting consumer different from second 
application this. Such that mentioned previously, on superiority in application Shopee Food and Go-Food Thing this 
make interest buy different. See ability people are different in terms of food consumption, this makes each community 
choose the advantages they want according to the needs and purchasing ability of the people. Like case Shopee Food 
which have superiority in cost which low naturally Thing this Becomes interest more on consumer which is at on 
condition financial low going to medium. Whereas, on application Go Food which offer superiority in the form of 
feature which make it easy users as well as in ordering access to delivery usually this is of more interest on consumer 
which is at on condition financial medium going to tall or from public which expect ease of purchase. 
 
Conclusion 
Application Shopee Food and Go Food both of them each have superiority. Like Shopee Food which has advantages 
such as having lots of free vouchers shipping, has many store vouchers, and easy payment process. Whereas, on 
application Go Food have superiority like convenience in access, convenience in the process between and accuracy 
(location) in delivery.  
 
Interest buy consumer in do booking by on line influenced by some factors. Found that the factors that influence buyer 
interest are usually because you get a free shipping voucher or a discount voucher. known, in the Shopee food 
application, more vouchers are provided than in application Go food, in application Go-Jek more often give vouchers 
or piece price for other features like Go ride. 
 
Consumer buying interest in ordering food online using the application Shopee Food and Go Food are known based on 
the capabilities and needs of consumers. It is known that consumers who expect low value in purchases usually tend 
use application Shopee Food. Whereas, on public which expect convenience in process purchase Go Food usually tend 
use Go Food application. 
 
Suggestions 
Shopee Food and Go Food applications need to maintain excellence so that consumers maintain their buying interest. 
In addition to maintaining, the Shopee Food app and Go Food must also be able to renew excellence by observing what 
is Becomes need consumer moment this. With each other observe what which Becomes superiority and weakness from 
competitors could make application the more good in Becomes choice for society. 
 
Shopee Food and Go Food applications need to observe the factors that influence interest buy consumer like case 
superiority from features which owned each application that makes consumers interested in the application. Shopee 
Food is known already very good at providing the best range in price to consumers, however in terms of ease of access, 
the Shopee Food application is not easy to use by various users among. Meanwhile, Go Food has been very good at 
providing easy access from purchase to delivery to buyers, but Go Food is not friendly in providing quality prices by 
providing higher prices from the store. From these two things, it is hoped that each of these two applications will need 
observe competitors and consumer needs for progress application that alone. 
 
Shopee Food and Go Food applications are usually used by people with certain conditions different financial and

Abstract 
 
Blockchain technology is a disruptive technology that is currently being adapted for many enterprise use cases and as 
the applications of blockchain technology continues to widen, the pharmaceutical industry remains an optimistic 
industry with various challenges to provide solutions for. In this literature review, the researchers gathered and 
examined relevant studies to the opportunities of blockchain in the pharmaceutical industry and challenges of 
blockchain performance. The study identified that one of the largest opportunity areas for blockchain in the 
pharmaceutical industry is within its supply chain. Issues within the pharmaceutical supply chain involve illegal 
distribution practices, counterfeit drugs and inefficient drug recall management. With specific challenges and issues 
identified in blockchain performance, this study proposed the development of a specific blockchain implementation 
focused on Distribution and Recall transactions within the pharmaceutical supply chain. The proposed system is eyed 
for a performance evaluation as evaluating the performance of a specific blockchain implementation still yields 
importance.

1. Introduction  
Blockchain is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that is first used in known cryptocurrency platforms 
such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Because of the technology’s integration of security, trust, and transparency, the 
technology is now seen as a notable solution in various industry use cases. Owing to this, early blockchain platforms 
are being customized to apply the technology in enterprise use, and as these platforms are being tailored to suit the 
industry requirements, Hyperledger Fabric was developed from the group up with enterprise context as its main goal. 
As blockchain becomes popular, it is important to assess and evaluate its performance with regard to various use-cases 
and scenarios that could possibly affect its overall functionality. Performance evaluation in blockchain applications 
concerns the measurement of essential metrics, such as success rate, average latency, throughput, and resource 
consumption. Regardless of the advantage of blockchain technology, it still yields technical issues that need to be 
addressed by conducting a performance evaluation in order for it to become a more improved and realistic replacement 
to the traditional centralized applications in the market.

6. Conclusion  
Based on the information gathered and provided in this study, many challenges concern the performance of blockchain 
applications, requiring further evaluation of the technology’s performance for a specific industry use-case. As the 
technology is continually being customized for enterprise use, performance should be one of the major criteria in 
enabling the technology.

Abstract 
 
Universities have an important role in implementing Entrepreneurship Education in their programs to develop the 
potential of their students as entrepreneurs. In developing these entrepreneurs, there is an entrepreneurial ecosystem 
that is built to ensure the development of the entrepreneurial and business side of students. The purpose of this research 
is to find out the impact of the ecosystem on students and what things are needed by students to become entrepreneurs 
and develop their businesses on campus. This study uses a qualitative approach. Data was collected through a survey 
using open-ended questions from creativepreneurship students from Binus Bandung. A total of 465 students (new 
entrepreneurs) responded. They are divided into 2 major sections, namely students who underwent an entrepreneurial 
journey before the covid pandemic, and the second was students who underwent online lectures due to the pandemic. 
The results showed that there were differences in students who attended college before and during the pandemic. The 
impact felt by students is related to business knowledge and the experience of doing business. There are several things 
that would like to be added so that the benefits of the ecosystem can be improved. Also, there are factors that influence 
student business growth during university studies. This research helps universities to obtain evaluation data and 
overview for making strategies that are more effective and efficient in helping students develop their businesses. The 
uniqueness of this research is to see the entrepreneurial ecosystem within the campus with students who have been 
entrepreneurs since the beginning of college, then look at the aspect of campus provision, and see the needs of students 
in the midst of the current covid pandemic.

Introduction  
Entrepreneurship is one of the economic influences in many countries (Matlay  2008). Entrepreneurship development 
demands a process to create a new generation of entrepreneurs who can provide solutions for the country or the world. 
The need for entrepreneurship education continues to grow and increase (Carey and Naudin  2006). 
 
Education has been considered as a good method for developing entrepreneurship and innovation (Lin and Xu  2017). 
It is a challenge for universities to make continuous improvements in facilitating students to grow their entrepreneurial 
skills (Binks et al.  2006). Higher education plays an important role because it can be an actor that helps developing 
countries economically and socially (Farhangmehr et al.  2016). Entrepreneurship education and programs developed 
by the faculty are focused on helping students and companies to thrive (Mwasalwiba  2010) which should be 
distributed throughout the university to provide opportunities for all students (Jones et al.  2012).

From the results of the cross tabulation research in table 3. The data shows that there are several factors that influence 
the growth and development of student business during college. The biggest factor can be seen in the marketing 
process, the intention and motivation of the students, and the network. From students who went through before and 
after the pandemic felt that the marketing process was an important element in developing their business. Then, the 
intentions and motivation of students also become a big enough influence. And the role of networking also makes it 
easier for them to access information, data, opportunities and helps in increasing motivation to do business. Another 
influencing factor for students before the pandemic was mentoring with experts and a supportive environment in terms  
influential is time management and the team, because they have to do business and lecture online. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Students who underwent lectures before the pandemic and during the pandemic felt different impacts between each 
generation. In terms of perceived impact, it can be seen aspects that have an impact on business and student learning. 
Students also have a desire to improve several aspects of the current entrepreneurial ecosystem in order to develop 
their business even better. The limitations that exist in these aspects are due to a pandemic that limits space for 
movement. In addition, this study also shows the factors that influence the growth and development of student 
business. This can help universities to strengthen these factors. This research is useful for universities to prepare an 
entrepreneurial ecosystem that can increase the business capacity of students. This research data can be used as 
evaluation material and input for developing appropriate strategies to help students develop their businesses. This 
research is limited to one university that is undergoing an entrepreneurial ecosystem to produce entrepreneurial 
graduates. The next research proposal is to develop a strategy to improve every aspect of the entrepreneurial 
ecosystem.

Abstract 
Pregnancy health monitoring systems enable women to have access to remote quality care during pregnancy. The 
integration of wearable devices has had a positive impact on maternal health care monitoring technologies. Maternal 
health requires a comprehensive structure that permits pregnant women to be closely monitored in a continuous 
manner. As a result, the necessity to assess its usability grows. In order to identify what features and processes 
implemented in existing applications aid in overcoming the usability challenges of pregnancy-related apps, related 
studies involving pregnant health care monitoring systems, pregnancy-related apps, and their usability evaluation were 
found and examined in this literature review. From the literature reviewed, there are several usability issues that are 
frequently found in pregnancy health monitoring systems such as the lack of ability to provide better health outcomes 
and lack of improvement in health monitoring. The analysis showed that these issues stem from the lack of 
effectiveness and ultimately result in negative impacts on user experience. This was likewise the most prominent 
usability challenge found in the literature reviewed. Other usability challenges found include the lack of interest in the 
applications, having too much incomprehensible information, and apps being non-user-friendly. In addition, the study 
identified that IoT-based process flows are helpful in recording data and maintaining user engagement. With this, the 
study proposed the development of a pregnant health monitoring system based on IoT-based processes. A usability 
evaluation was planned for the proposed system to test and assess its usability.

1. Introduction 
Electronic health (eHealth), according to the World Health Organization, is the utilization of information and 
communication technologies (ICT) cost-effectively and securely in health-related fields (World Health Organization 
2022). Forms of interventions were found to have been increased within the grounds of the emergence of eHealth 
systems (Sherifali et al. 2017). Furthermore, eHealth technologies are found to be beneficial for women's reproductive 
health care. Meanwhile, Internet-of-things (IoT) is defined as, the control of hardware and software combined with 
the utilization of the Internet. It is likewise used for exchange as well as the association of data through sensors and 
actuators (Priyanka et al. 2019). Li et al. (2020) investigated the impact of IoT on maternal healthcare monitoring 
technologies. The study proved that IoT had a huge impact on pregnancy care as women favored wearable devices 
such as smartwatches and bracelets during pregnancy. Many studies regarding the development of pregnancy health 
monitoring systems or maternal monitoring systems have incorporated IoT wearables in the applications. Sarhaddi et

different components are laid out in the diagram. Since the proposed application will be a pregnancy monitoring 
system, journaling, with the doctor’s advice through teleconsultation, will serve as one of its features as it is known to 
be a tool that allows pregnant women to better identify triggers for poor health, keep track of good and bad days, and 
put their experiences into context (Godfrey-Isaacs 2019). In implementing IoT wearables, their APIs will be integrated 
into the application for vital sign tracking. This collected data from the wearables are included in journaling where the 
patients log their vital signs in along with their comprehensive entry of experiences. In line with that, index-repeating 
features contribute in tracking the patient’s progress through the journal entries a patient logs in. Index repeating is a 
mechanism that uses the difference between two indexes to enable future broadcasts. TelHER, comprising all the 
entities aforementioned, will be undergoing usability evaluation where it will be tested for five usability principles: 
effectiveness, efficiency, memorability, learnability, and satisfaction.

6. Conclusion 
Upon further analysis, there were several usability challenges found in the gathered pregnancy-related applications 
that required further improvement and testing, and most of them expressed the system's lack of effectiveness. Features 
and processes of existing pregnancy health monitoring systems were also identified which served as bases for the 
proposed system of the study, utilizing Nielsen's usability principles to evaluate the system usability to address 
previous challenges encountered by past studies.

Abstract 
There was an increase in e-commerce business by 26% amid the weakening of the Indonesian economy due to Covid-
19. This is supported by the existence of digital payment methods. There were 260 million online transactions during 
the second quarter of 2020 with an average of more than 2.8 million transactions per day. E-commerce is believed to be 
the booster of the Indonesian economy. The company was forced to WFH (work from home) in order to keep the 
company's operations running. This concept is believed to help employees to stay productive. With flexibility in place 
and time, as well as work methods, employees can be more developed and productive. The research method used is 
Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which is a planned review to answer the solution of specific research problems 
using a systematic and explicit methodology to identify, select, and critically evaluate the results of the studies included 
in the literature review. Productivity is defined as the ratio of the results that may be obtained with the overall power or 
production elements used to achieve company goals. The main goal of the company is to generate profits while being 
the best in fulfilling consumer desires. Among these goals, the organization is always productive in producing quality, 
quality, and sustainable products.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to analyze the roles of agricultural industries in the Japanese national economy. This study 
employs Input-Output (IO) analysis as an analysis tool. More specifically, this study utilizes the parts of IO analysis, 
namely simple output multiplier, simple household income multiplier, index of the power of dispersion, and index of 
the sensitivity of dispersion as analysis apparatuses. The analysis period of this study is 1985-2005. In this study, the 
analyzed sectors are crop cultivation and agricultural services. The results show that, by using both multipliers, the 
analyzed agricultural industries did not include in the top five Japanese industrial sectors from 1985 through 2005. By 
using both indices, one can claim that agricultural services sector lied in quadrant III on the analysis period. 
Meanwhile, crop cultivation industry lied in quadrant II from 1985 through 1995 while it moved to quadrant III 
afterwards. Based on these quadrant positions, one can argue that the analyzed industries had weak impacts on the 
whole Japanese industries on the analysis period.

1. Introduction 
The industrial sectors are important aspects in a national economy. Their contributions can be observed not only on 
the micro aspect, but also on the macro aspect of a country. Also, their important roles can be seen both in developed 
and developing countries. One of the industrial sectors that worth to be discussed in this matter is the agricultural 
industry. 
 
There are many previous studies discuss the agricultural aspect. For example, Akinwehinmi et al. (2021) analyze the 
impact of consumers’ Food Control Risk Perception (FCRP) on preference for food safety attributes with a special 
focus on three certification choices, namely (1) government-controlled, (2) Participatory Guarantee System (PGS)-
driven, and (3) foreign certification. One of the points that is noticed in their study is consumers’ awareness of organic 
agriculture. As a case for their study, they utilize choice experimental data from Nigeria. Engemann et al. (2022) 
analyze the role of exporters' Institutional Quality (IQ) and its similarity with importers' IQ in the constancy of trade

Abstract 
 
During this pandemic, in the process of mentoring students, a different approach is needed. Entrepreneurship students 
need to improve their entrepreneurial skills in terms of creativity. As creativepreneurs, students have aspirations for 
things that support their creativity. The purpose of this research is to find students' perspectives on creativity, as well 
as what things support the effectiveness of their creativity. Data was collected through an open-ended question survey 
which was then processed using qualitative data analysis software. Coding is done to get the main themes in this 
research. The data is filled in by 88 creativepreneurship students. The results of this study indicate that there are themes 
that were born from the student's point of view of creativity, such as new ideas, problem solving, differentiation, and 
uniqueness. In the following findings, it can be seen that the influence of current technology makes it easier for 
creativepreneur students to spark their creative ideas, and discussion and brainstorming are powerful ways to generate 
creative ideas. This research is useful for universities that focus on developing entrepreneurship students to assist them 
according to their habits and needs, so that entrepreneurial skills in terms of creative thinking can be maximized. The 
uniqueness of this research lies in the findings of the creative ecosystem needs in this pandemic era to support the 
improvement of student entrepreneurial skills.

Abstract 
 
This article will describe how the Value-Focused Management Model (VFM) is perceived in different literature 
references, evaluate what was the implementation status of the technique in healthcare organizations before the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and understand the impact it had on the road map of the healthcare transformation. Moreover, 
to better understand the perceived importance of the model by different entities, multiple real-case scenarios and 
surveys will be reviewed. The main theoretical foundation for the article will be the book “Focused Operations 
Management for Healthcare Organizations” by Boaz Ronen, Joseph S. Pliskin, and Shimeon Pass. 
Keywords 
Value-Focused Management, Healthcare, Value Creation, Patient Outcomes, Value-based Reimbursement. 
 
1. Introduction 
Healthcare is, arguably, the all-important segment that enabled the human society to evolve and grow at outstanding 
rates in the past few years, whilst also being a major revenue stream in countries where government-subsidized health 
is not provided. Nevertheless, as the COVID-19 pandemic proved, the amazing competence of the healthcare 
workforce along with its will, spirit of sacrifice, and resilience are, unfortunately, not sufficient to avoid severe 
complications when not paired with an equally exceptional management technique. 
As it is widely known, many different approaches can be used when managing a healthcare system, yet this article 
will, as the title references, evaluate value-focused management and its application in healthcare organizations.  
In a plain explanation, VFM provides a foundation for companies to achieve a sustainable and low-cost care 
environment, whilst giving customers the opportunity to flee from the antiquated fee-for-service approach, that only 
benefits the big players and places the patients at all kinds of financial risk. 
Anyhow, a more thorough evaluation should be conducted to seek the viability of the value-focused management 
technique, assess potential benefits, and analyze real-world implementation drawbacks. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of this scientific article is to review multiple literature sources and supplementary documentation to 
provide a state-of-the-art overview of the research that has been conducted on the value-focused management in 
healthcare, whilst also referencing the strategic value drivers in such methodology, from different perspectives and 
reports. The VFM technique shall also be subject to a reality check, where its implementation prominence is reviewed 
both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, focus is placed on showcasing the possible improvements that 
VFM can bring to the future of healthcare, along with the tools that should be used and the governmental mindset that 
should be ingrained. 
 
2. Literature Review 
An array of different management approaches can be used to improve upon internal performance (Koller et al. 1994), 
such as continuous improvement techniques, total quality management, and kaizen events, yet these often fail in 
clarifying concrete performance measures and can deviate from the ultimate goal of value creation. Hence the

1361","6. Build an enabling information technology platform – the last component of the described value agenda is 
supposed to act as a support for the other five. It means creating an IT system that shares information between 
departments and between organizations in order to gather all the information of a certain patient rather than have the 
information split by each service provided. To properly work, there is a need to create a common language between 
them and to include all types of relevant data, so that it can be shared and used between all of the departments and 
involved entities, streamlining communication, and driving performance improvement. This can be achieved by 
standardizing templates along with the IPU teams and having a system architecture that allows easy data extraction. 
Such systems also ease objective number five, creating partnerships between involved entities, as it allows easy 
communication of results and performance measures.  
Having looked at all the value agenda points is possible to understand that they are all related and essential for a 
successful industry transformation. It is also important to highlight that the transformation is more likely to be 
successful if there are government pressures. If a single healthcare organization, even if a big one, tries to transform 
the whole internal structure to a VBM approach, it would not be aligned with the current industry measures. So, if 
pressure comes from above, in this case, governmental organizations, the change will be for all, providers and payers, 
and the performance measures would be comparable. Besides, it was proved that by creating relevant performance 
measures and sharing them between organizations (points 2 and 6) the general performance will improve, being this 
a direct and known consequence of a competitive market. In the end, one can say that a competitive market is what is 
required to properly add value from a patient’s perspective. 
 
5. Conclusion 
After reviewing the current models of healthcare, the trends, and some of the thoughts shared by industry leaders, is 
fair to say that there is still a long way to go to collect all the benefits that come from a value-based care system. 
Although this path was designed and started to be pursued a long time ago, different circumstances, such as the 
COVID-19 pandemic, had impacted this transformation and delayed its implementation.  
Now, in the recovery from the pandemic, the U.S. health system has a great opportunity to actively change its 
approach. The industry CEOs have shown concerns about different issues and admitted that personnel shortages and 
financial challenges are on top of the list of issues to be addressed.  
Luckily, both these issues can be, at least partially, solved by reorganizing the organizational structure and adopting 
cross-functional teams, and by implementing an outcome-based costing model. The research presented showed 
successful cases for both of these suggestions and strengthened the hypothesis that this is the way to go. However, the 
most critical point is that the pressure toward such an industry transformation must be applied by governmental and 
regulatory agencies, as the old models still in place don’t leave much space for providers and payers to change and 
still comply with their legal obligations.

Abstract 
 
The contribution of the transportation and warehousing sector in Indonesia in 2020 decreased to rank eight at 3.81% 
compared to 2019 data at rank seven at 4.41%, according to data from the Central Bureau of Statistics Indonesia 
(BPS). The decline in the transportation and warehousing business sector to the GDP contribution has resulted in oil 
and gas companies implementing a strategic advantage with cost leadership to achieve a strategic fit for efficient 
supply chain lubricants. The existence of service time limits in the warehouse for shipping and receiving lubricant 
products is essential in determining an efficient route. The addition of depot points as a solution to meet the demand 
for lubricants to the service level. The proposed depot point is obtained through K-Means Clustering and optimal route 
with limited truck capacity and service time in the warehouse using the CVRPTW (Capacitated Vehicle Routing 
Problem with Time Windows) method. The data is used to realize shipments of lubricant products in 2019-2021 in 
state-owned oil and gas companies in Indonesia. The realization data for 2019 describes the demand for pre-covid 19 
lubricants. The realization data for 2020 is the demand for lubricants during covid 19, and the realization data for 2021 
describes the demand for lubricants post-covid-19. The results obtained two proposed hub points at coordinates -
6.59395726,107.47077792 and -7.388939,111.76971405. Furthermore, the increase in truck utility is 72%, and the 
total cost after adding a depot is 10% lower than the existing condition.

Abstract 
To ensure the flow of products with different classes in supply chains such as closed-loop supply chains, etc., 
managing quality uncertainty estimation is a cost-effective, profitable, and environment-friendly contribution by 
establishing standard recovery treatments of cores. The paper compares the quality values obtained from Bayesian 
analysis with deterministic levels to analyze the core retrieval strategies. The uncertainty effects due to several 
quality factors are demonstrated in both the inspection and disassembly stages. Such as misclassification that 
occurred because of overlapping of quality ranges in consideration with fuzzy evaluation during value and 
material recovery. Moreover, the adopted dual methodology invalidates the legitimacy of providing probability 
distribution to unknown variables in previously developed models. Both probabilistic and prescriptive models are 
moderated by the qualitative assessment of cores facilitated by realistic scenarios. With the help of the proposed 
mixed approaches, the current research contributes to the knowledge of core retrieval management by 
incorporating the quality variability in the model at the product level. The result demonstrates that quality 
estimates ensure precise eligibility and misclassification detection of returns of cores at the initial stages well-
before exhaustive remanufacturing operations.

1. Introduction 
With a sense of responsibility to decrease the environmental impact, take-back legislation continuously pressures 
manufacturers, recyclers, and remanufacturers to take back the used products collectively and individually with 
little compensation relief like incentives, discounts, etc., to consumers. Such green initiatives instigate consumers 
to buy green products and the providers to manufacture green products. Quality variability and return uncertainty 
are significant challenges in supply chain management. Primarily returns are of four types: end-of-life returns, 
end-of-use returns, commercial returns, and reusable components (Fleischmann et al.  2000). The returns are 
uncertain and available in high volumes, various types, series, and versions (Guide 2000). Remanufacturers can 
reduce return volume, timing, and quality uncertainties by actively controlling the acquisition effort and methods 
(Wei et al. 2015).  
 
A core is the basis of the restoration of any used product. The core consists of multiple modules component(s) of 
the product that retains and encapsulates the value of the product (Parkinson & Thompson 2003), that are 
materially recycled, reused, refurbished, or disposed of (Jayaraman  2006). 
The objective of the study is to provide a solution to the problem of sorting and grading cores into different classes 
by establishing the quality range. In the study, the decision is made on sorting the cores using the quality index to 
reusable, remanufacturable, and recyclable classes. That is followed by the establishment of quality ranges for 
each class by determining the quality levels which grade the sorted cores. The following research questions are 
answered with the help of this study: (1) What are the limits of quality levels of cores eligible for different re-
manufacturability statuses such as remanufacturable, recyclable, and reusable? (2) How quality estimation affects 
the core retrieval decisions? (3) What is the likelihood of misclassification that ensures a better quality of cores?

4.3 Misclassification Scenarios 
During the inspection of any engine core, fuzziness in the classification process (i.e., sorting and grading) is 
responsible for such ranges. The possibility of error in the classification process of returns is misclassification. With 
effective credibility intervals, the quality of cores is estimated at the most crucial inspection and disassembly stages 
of remanufacturing. The posterior density plots are shown for all the quality classes w.r.t. probability on the x-axis. 
For both, the stages length of the quality classes are not equal to each other and do not match with equal probability 
intervals. Suppose a quality of a returned core falls to the recyclable category even then a quality proportion of it 
consists little amount of qualities of reusable and remanufacturable. This might increase remanufacturing costs, 
processing costs and other related recovery costs than usual due to misclassification if done. The proportion of each 
class having some quality of different classes might hamper the associated cost structure (Table 4).

The misclassification is found and analyzed in overlapping ranges in the quality levels. The uncertainties found in 
experts’ insights when asked to classify the core in both the inspection and disassembly stage during core acquisition 
phases. Such error incorporates unfeasible and unacceptable quality levels which misjudge the particular class of 
core into other classes. The following scenarios can be mentioned for unfeasible quality levels. First, it is quite 
infeasible to recover parts after a severe disassembly process with utmost functionality levels and no disassembling 
time. The value corresponding in this situation is 0.05; refer to the leftmost value in figure 4. Another similar 
scenario could be when the core takes maximum disassembling time with no parts recovery, without any destruction 
but fulfilling the highest satisfaction levels (rightmost value 0.95). In the former scenario, the core is misclassified 
as reusable, and later the core is misclassified as recyclable. A core is misclassified as remanufacturable when severe 
disassembling is done without proper invigilation and assumes the core is satisfactory with the perception of being 
recyclable. 
 
The misclassification of cores can be devised by identifying and locating any recoverable's minimum and maximum 
quality levels. Misclassification occurred, and hence, both the highest and lowest quality cores are devoid of proper 
recovery treatments. But the probability of misclassification must be included when grading the returns during the 
inspection. If the engine core is graded in the recyclable range, then 0.06-005=0.01 margin is included. Similarly, if 
the core is graded in the reusable range, then 0.88-0.81=0.07 margin is included. Such inclusions incorporate the 
misclassification errors in the grading mechanism and extend the range of quality levels by calculated margins. 
 
6. Conclusion and Managerial Implications 
The study fills the gaps in establishing quality levels of returns by investigating two approaches, viz. probabilistic 
and prescriptive. The proposed grading and sorting tool provides the determination of quality range at the product 
level rather than assuming any popular distribution scheme. Some managerial implications are as follows: Firstly, 
the quality levels are better in the disassembly stage due to the attainment of filtered cores after inspection. The 
unfeasible scenarios should be identified and rectified by the managers in the decision making (1) When the core is 
fully functional and possess recoverable after severe disassembly in no time. (2) When the core is fully functional 
with no parts recovery when given maximum time for disassembly without any severe destruction.

1383","Secondly, misclassification can be prevented in the classification scenario. The core is misclassified as 
remanufacturable when severe disassembling is done without proper invigilation and assumes the core is satisfactory 
with the perception of being recyclable. The corrective actions are prescribed at the operational levels by prioritising 
quality factors, which are mostly responsible for the core retrieval such that maximum value recovery is attained. 
The scope of the current research can be extended to capture the value in other stages of remanufacturing. Since the 
universal scale is adopted using whitenisation functions to establish the quality ranges, the study can be applied to 
different variety of products, from heavy electrical machinery to white goods.

Abstract 
Smart mobility is one of the essential aspects of smart cities, and the proper management of intelligent mobility can 
create an optimized and sustainable smart city. For these reasons, the field of intelligent transport remains a sector that 
attracts research attention, and hence there is a need for a scoping review on this topic. This paper presents a scoping 
review of intelligent mobility management systems (IMMSs) with the aim of clarifying and summarizing the status 
of relevant articles dealing with this topic. 
In this paper, we describe and apply the process of a scoping review as proposed by Peterson to the topic of IMMSs, 
based on a research method previously applied in the field of medicine. A total of 266 relevant articles were selected, 
and a classification framework was applied to extract the information needed to carry out an in-depth analysis of 
IMMSs. This analysis gave us a clear vision of the subject and produced a new state of the art. The novel contributions 
of our work are as follows: 
1. We introduce a general framework for classifying information from studies in this area; 
2. We present a summary of current research on the subject; 
3. We discuss our results and their implications for future research. 
This scoping review provided us with a general overview of the topic of IMMSs and helped us identify gaps and trends 
in this field. One of the conclusions that can be drawn from this scoping review is that this is an active research area 
that is attracting attention from researchers, with many open issues still to be addressed.

1386","4.1 Methods and techniques 
According to our results, AI was the most widely used technology (102/217), followed by GPS (17/217) and IoT 
(16/217). The use of AI, GPS, and IoT in IMMSs can be explained by the desire to improve the transport sector and 
to make it intelligent (via AI) and to achieve autonomy and high communication (provided by IoT and GPS), and 
hence to achieve the transformation of traditional cities into smart cities. 
 
4.2 Annual trends in publications 
For this paper, we studied articles published between 2017 and 2021. The two years of 2019 and 2020 produced large 
numbers of publications (82/266 and 105/266) compared to the others, while in 2021, 46/266 publications were 
produced. The number of publications appearing between 2019 and 2020 was due to the emergence of COVID-19, 
which prompted researchers to publish more articles on IMMSs to improve and facilitate transportation. Regarding 
the number of contributions for the year 2021, we note that we began this study in 2021. 
 
4.3 Trends in authors’ countries  
In order to determine which countries made more contributions to the field of IMMSs, we based our information on 
the institutions to which the authors belonged. As Figure 5 shows, China and USA made more contributions (175/266 
papers for China and 39/266 for the USA). These rankings may be due to the economic power of these countries and 
the rate of investment in R&D. The USA is the world’s highest investor in R&D, followed by China (Khan et al. 2020; 
Sargent and John 2021). 
 
4.4. Application domain 
Figure 4 shows that the field of road transportation had more contributions (207/266 papers) than rail transportation 
and other domains. This can be explained by the difficulties and transportation problems that disrupted the world 
during the COVID-19 pandemic; these encouraged researchers to focus more closely on road transport, since it was 
the only form that remained operational, albeit with certain precautions to avoid the spread of the epidemic. 
 
4.5. Publication channels  
Reaching a trade-off between “existing research coverage on a topic” and “a manageable range of studies to examine” 
represents the key to the success of any systematic study (Haibi et al. 2022). To achieve this objective, we limited our 
search to open access documents; this decision was made due to the very high number of studies found during the first 
screening, and also the accessibility to data offered by this type of research document. In addition, there has been a 
shift from hard copies to electronic copies, which has greatly increased the accessibility of published studies, and 
especially open access publications (Drissi et al. 2020). The results for this research question indicate that the dominant 
publication channel was journal papers. A set of ethics and rules frame the process of publication in a rigorous 
scientific journal, resulting in the production of high-quality research content (Drissi et al. 2020). This may justify the 
high numbers of this type of document. 
 
4.6. Types of studies 
We obtained the following results: solution proposal (249/266 papers), followed by evaluation research (7/266), 
experience papers (3/266), and synthesis papers (2/266). The explanation for the number of solution proposal 
publications being greater than the other types of publication may be that the field of IMMSs is not yet a mature 
domain. Our scoping review shows that most authors have proposed methods and solutions that have not yet been 
empirically validated, suggesting that future work should focus on validating these methods. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper has presented a scoping review of IMMSs, and has provided a general overview of the topic with its trends 
and gaps. The number of evaluated papers was 266, all of which were published between 2017 and 2021 in recognized 
databases (IEEE Xplore and Scopus). We obtained the following results, which may clarify the outlook of researchers 
wanting to work on IMMSs. The methods most commonly applied to this topic were AI, IoT, and GPS. The use of 
these techniques may be explained by the very high numbers of connected devices and the aim of creating an intelligent 
world. The year 2020 saw a large number of scientific contributions to the subject of IMMSs. In the period between 
2017 and 2021, China and USA were the countries with the highest interest in this topic. This result is likely to be due 
to the R&D investment rates of these countries. Although there are several application areas associated with IMMSs, 
road transportation was predominant during the period studied, and the main contribution was mobility management.

Abstract 
 
Recent years have shown some pioneering and advanced academic study areas required for the diversified business 
environment. These modern academic programs are prepared and offered to meet the market demands and needs. 
Product management is one of the innovative fields which is getting importance and growing rapidly in the recent 
years. The study focused that which academic program will help and guide the SMEs and business enterprises for the 
better prospect for their business? Unfortunately, a lack of qualified and certified product managers or product 
developers has also been observed in the recent past. Nevertheless, Product managers have become vital to business 
success because of their choices, decisions, and actions inherent to the attainment or failure of business growth. 
However, undergraduate programs are not equipped with proper certificate courses for product management, product 
design, or product development. This complicates the students in opting and joining any academic major to become a 
professional product manager. Thus, the basic issue is about which academic discipline is better suited for the 
development of successful product managers. Hence, the basic purpose of the study is to investigate the academic 
study disciplines that best serve the product manager career. In addition, the study explores whether an academic 
program such as Bachelor's, Master or Ph.D. degree is essential and helpful for product managers. A thorough 
literature review, analysis of workforce databases, and questions asked by key product executives are used for the 
current study. The study's approach is descriptive and exploratory to assess and evaluate the collected data. It uses a 
cross-sectional survey method for data analysis purposes. The findings indicate that a bachelor’s degree in business, 
marketing, computer science or engineering, and information technology are the most popular specializations for 
product managers. The study also discussed the market needs and demands to distinguish between different job 
professions to better understand the academic requirements for product managers. Additionally, it was found that 
competent product managers after gaining substantial expertise in their field quite often pursue a master's in business 
management, business administration (MBA), or leadership.

1. Introduction 
Academic programs are a fundamental source of providing the most updated knowledge at the higher education level. 
Product manager a pioneering academic degree can be useful for Small & Medium Businesses Enterprises (SMEs) 
and big business enterprises. It is worthy to mention here that Project Managers are somehow contributing to the 
business and sometimes get tangled with each other. Furthermore, the marketing department and product managers 
work together to create an effective marketing strategy in a competitive business environment because it is very 
important for the customer to know about the product details (Porter 1987 ; Man  Lau  et al. 2002). Similarly, 
organizations must demonstrate that they are truly flexible to respond to environmental fluctuations, as well as 
potentially create future changes, in order to succeed (Hedberg  Nystrom et al. 1976;  Rainey  2010). Achievement 
and destiny will be determined by product innovation (Sadeh and Dvir 2020). Specialists think that a human asset is 
a critical component of capital resources in the formation of the competitive edge because a person’s unique 
characteristics enable them to be one of the most flexible and adaptive factors (Singh  Agrawal et al. 2021). Product 
management proponents believe that the product manager role was created in response to the vital enterprise need to 
create actual revenue centers within their organizations (Luck 1969). It is critical to debate how much a product

The figure above states that monitoring project development, writing product requirements, creating sales 
presentations, creating materials for external audiences, and writing details specifications are highly suited job 
descriptions for the product manager. Whereas rest of the options are closely relevant to all three job portfolios and 
must be considered as per the business needs and demands. 
6 Conclusions 
Over the years the area of a product manager has developed the need for highly structured, technically skilled 
employees who also possess critical-thinking skills and can use creative strategies to solve business problems. This 
study shows that what education a product manager should have and what avenues of academic studies are best suited 
for product managers. The study also provides answers to common questions regarding job opportunities and relevant 
professions. The study focuses on the education needs and experience required by Saudi business advertisers and 
employers. In the recruitment of product managers, the concept of envisioning business, strategic, and entrepreneurial 
mindsets have played an integral role. According to the survey, strategic thinking is the most important notion for the 
product management profession. The majority of firms are looking for technical product management expertise when 
hiring a product manager. Data analysis tools, Microsoft Excel ability, and product strategy formulation are among 
these highly preferred skills. Information technology, which is highlighted in the advertisements, is another important 
factor for the product manager. Well-trained, educated, experienced product managers are vital in the innovative 
product development process, productivity, profitability, and competitiveness of a business organization. A product 
manager must have advanced product development capabilities for a company to remain relevant in its marketplace 
and grow rapidly while improving over a certain period of time. Market need is also observed by addressing some of 
the common job roles in the business organizations as it was compared with two other job portfolios. It showed from 
good to a high number of involvement of product managers in the business organizations concerning different job 
requirements. 
According to the study results, product managers are often expected to have a bachelor's degree. That degree may be 
in Business Administration, Accounting, Computer Science, Management Sciences, Information Technology, or any 
other related field. The study showed that a product manager must have at least one professional certification in 
product management and a Bachelor's degree. No specific degree program is required to rise to the position of product 
manager. Education is not only important in this process but the number of years of experience is also very significant

of obtaining a Master’s degree in Business Management and Leadership or a Master’s in Business Administration 
(MBA) will be beneficial for the further progression. The role of the product manager can lead to many diverse and 
challenging positions that give rise to continued training and education so that the product manager can remain on the 
leading edge of the industry. Lastly, the study has contributed to the body of knowledge of this pioneer research 
domain of product managers in modern businesses.

Abstract 
 
Self-heating in materials with high energy dissipation such as polymers and polymer composites under vibrational 
cyclic loading can lead to catastrophic failure known as “heat explosion”. Predicting safe temperature increases is 
essential for critical structural applications. The properties of many polymer materials are strongly temperature 
dependent, thus emphasizing the importance of heat generation from mechanical vibrations. The analysis is based on 
the model predicting stress induced heat increase for viscoelastic materials under cyclic loading conditions. A set of 
stress-strain and creep experiments on PMMA at ambient and elevated temperatures was performed together with the 
mechanical engineering department. The data was used to determine the model parameters for viscoelastic mechanical 
stresses. Additional data from experimental testing of PMMA under vibrational loading has been analyzed and used 
to verify the developed model.

Abstract 
 
In this pandemic era, the ability to see business opportunities is one of the entrepreneurial skills that novice 
entrepreneurs need to master. The Business Incubator at the university is one of the units that need to incubate student 
businesses. As a form of support to improve entrepreneurial skills in seeing business opportunities, the purpose of this 
research is to try to see the pattern of entrepreneurship students in the effectiveness of seeing and getting business 
opportunities. This study uses a qualitative approach. With the help of qualitative data analysis software, open-ended 
question data from 88 students was processed using content analysis to get big themes that became patterns in finding 
business opportunities for MSMEs. The results of this study indicate that there are two major themes in determining 
or obtaining a business opportunity, namely the purpose or method. There are those who make it their goal to explore 
business potential, there are also those who use methods to find business opportunities. This research is useful for 
mentors at universities to help business students find businesses opportunities faster, provide stimulation, and increase 
effectiveness in mentoring. This research produces data analysis that will help people engaged in entrepreneurship 
education to have a pattern in finding business opportunities.

Abstract 
 
Mentoring activities in the Business Incubator at the University are very important in supporting the business 
acceleration of students. MSMEs built by students need to continue to develop in their business development through 
innovation. This study aims to see the pattern of innovation carried out by students’ MSMEs through the choice of 
whether they tend to be incremental or radical innovation. Data were collected from 88 entrepreneurship students, 
through open-ended survey questions which were then coded and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. 
The results of the study show that there is a balance between the choice of incremental or radical innovation. In 
incremental innovation, respondents see the need to carry out continuous improvement, benchmark and strengthen 
references to add value to innovation in their business. While in the radical improvement pattern, respondents focused 
on making new products on the market, something different from competitors, and rebranding. This research is useful 
for mentors at the Business Incubator to provide support in the innovation process carried out by entrepreneurial 
students as part of entrepreneurship education.

Abstract 
 
The development of the Computerized Test Margaritas arises from the need of the research team in the area of 
psychology to have an automated tool that supports the diagnosis of selective attention in children between the ages 
of 6 and 12 years. This document presents the different steps that lead to the achievement of a software product that 
supports the aforementioned need, designed for mobile devices, specifically for 7-inch tablets. The construction of 
this product began with the lifting of requirements, definition of the software architecture, database design, interface 
design prototype, software development and finally, application of pilot tests until obtaining the desired final product. 
After passing the pilot test stage, a sample is considered at the level of several cities of Ecuador in which the test is 
applied to measure its reliability obtaining a value of 0.90 according to the Kuder Richardson method and whose result 
guarantees the validity of the test.

1413","Figure 7. Results of test application. 
 
The reliability and validity verification phase was conducted following the construction and validation of the tests 
process according to APA of 2012 (APA). The following activities were performed: 
 
• 
The assessment by expert judgment and a pilot test demonstrated understanding of the instructions and the 
execution of the test. The pilot test included a sample of 15 children of both genders. 
• 
Evidence-based on the response process: the analysis of the pilot test results shows no differences between the 
results of female and male participants but between ages, which was expected due to the stage of the development 
process. 
• 
External sources of evidence consist of analyzing various groups related to the aspect to be evaluated. The experts 
performed a test and retest on a sample of 40 children. 
• 
Factorial and item analysis: the Kuder Richardson method was applied due to the binomial nature of the variables 
(correct answers, incorrect answers), yielding a value of 0.90, with a sample of 1011 children. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Information technologies, specifically mobile devices, make it easier for professional psychologists and pedagogues 
to apply the test due to the ease of interaction of children with this type of device and the ease of mobilizing resources 
to different geographical areas. 
 
The evaluation of selective attention in children through the computerized Margaritas Test improves time and use of 
resources.

Abstract 
 
As people's demands grow, so does the need for bank loans. Every day, banks get many loan applications from 
customers and other individuals but not every applicant is accepted. Typically, banks execute a loan application after 
verifying and evaluating the applicant's eligibility, which is a time-consuming and challenging process. When 
examining loan applications and making credit approval decisions, most banks use their credit score and risk 
assessment systems. Despite this, some applicants fail to pay their bills each year, causing financial institutions to lose 
a substantial amount of money. In this study, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed to extract patterns 
from a common loan-approved dataset and predict deserving loan applicants. Customers' previous data will be used to 
undertake the study, including their age, income type, loan annuity, last credit bureau report, Type of organization they 
work for, and length of employment. ML methods such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Adaboost, Lightgbm, Decision 
tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor were used to discover the maximum relevant features, i.e., the elements that have the 
most impact on the prediction output. These mentioned algorithms are compared and assessed against one another 
using standard metrics. Among these, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 92%. It was also 
determined as the best model and performed significantly well better than other machine learning methods in terms of 
F1-Score, which is 96%.

1. Introduction  
People prefer to apply for loans on the internet because data is growing daily due to digitization in the financial sector. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining popularity as a common tool for data analysis. Individuals from diverse 
businesses are using AI calculations to solve problems based on their sector knowledge. Banks are having a difficult 
time getting loans approved. Every day, bank staff are faced with a large number of applications to manage, and the 
odds of making a mistake are significant. Almost every bank's fundamental operation is the distribution of loans. The 
profit earned from the loans distributed by the bank’s accounts. So, one mistake can make a massive loss to a bank 
(Gupta et al  2020).  
 
The primary goal in the banking sector is to place their funds in safe hands. Many banks and financial institutions now 
grant loans after a lengthy process of verification and validation, but there is no guarantee that the chosen applicant is

6.Conclusion and Future Scope  
Today's fast-growing IT sector requires the development of new technology and the updating of existing technology 
that allows us to eliminate human interference and boost job productivity. This model is used for the banking system 
or anyone who wants to apply for a loan. Based on the examination of the data, it is apparent that it reduces all frauds 
committed during the loan approval process. Time is valuable to everyone, and by doing so, not only the bank, but 
also the applicant's waiting time will be reduced. Cleaning and processing of data, imputation of missing values, 
experimental analysis of data set, model construction, and testing on test data are all steps in the prediction process. 
The best-case accuracy attained on the original data set is 0.9189 on Data set. After analyzing the data, the following 
conclusions were drawn: those applicants with the lowest credit scores will be denied a loan since they have a higher 
risk of defaulting on the loan. Most of the time, applicants with a high income and requests for a smaller loan are more 
likely to be approved, which makes sense because they are more likely to repay their debts. Other factors, such as 
gender and marital status, do not appear to be considered by the corporation. This prediction module can be enhanced 
and integrated in the future. The system is prepared on the previous training data but in the future, it is possible to 
make changes to software, which can accept new testing data and should also take part in training data and predict 
accordingly.

Abstract 
 
With the rise in e-commerce and growing consumer demand, supply chains are striving to achieve cost-efficient 
delivery operations. One of the most challenging distribution problems is the last-mile delivery which generally refers 
to the very last leg of the delivery operation when a parcel is moved from a depot to the end customer. Despite the 
significant increase in the number of products ordered online and delivered directly to customers, the reliance on truck-
based delivery has remained unchanged for decades. The integration of drones in the last-mile delivery can overcome 
many operational challenges and provide competitive advantages. Traditional optimization algorithms for truck-drone 
suffer from high computational time and can solve only small-sized problems. This study focuses on finding an 
effective approach for solving the last-mile delivery problem. We propose a hybrid machine learning model to tackle 
the problem of delivering products to a set of delivery locations using a modern truck equipped with multiple drones. 
A constrained clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster delivery locations based on user-specified constraints in the 
first stage. The center of each constrained cluster serves as a launching site where the truck can park, and drones can 
be dispatched to make all final deliveries. A deep reinforcement learning model is proposed in the second stage to find 
an optimal route among all clusters. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. Solutions 
obtained are compared with other traditional algorithms. Results show that our approach can produce quality solutions 
in real-time.

Abstract  
 
The goal of this research is to identify and analyze the key factors influencing food loss in the fresh produce supply 
chain in developing countries, particularly Indonesia. This research derived fourteen influencing factors, each 
representing a specific context, from the literature and as well as data gathered through semi-structured interviews 
with a select group of experts. In addition, to analyze the identified factors, the Interpretative Structural Modeling 
Technique (ISM) and Matriced Impacts Analysis of Croise's Appliqués and Un Classement Multiplication (MICMAC) 
were used as integrated methods. The government's financing support for the food and agriculture sectors has not been 
maximized along with limited access to capital is the most significant factor, with a high tendency to affect the food 
loss in the fresh produce supply chain. The study's findings are expected to help business actors and policymakers 
identify and comprehend key factors. Insights from the findings will aid in the formulation of policies and strategic 
decisions concerning the reduction of food loss in the fresh produce supply chain, thereby assisting in the achievement 
of the goals of sustainable development regarding food loss.

1. Introduction 
Food loss refers to a decrease in the quantity of food in the food supply chain before the consumption stage. 
Food loss mainly occurs in the upstream supply chain, such as in the production, post-harvest and processing stages. 
The main drivers of food loss are infrastructure limitations, climatic and environmental factors, and assessments for 
quality or safety standards (Dora, 2019). 
Food loss and waste of fresh produce increases along with the increase in production. During the production 
and distribution process, fresh produce releases greenhouse gases into the air and continues to the disposal of food 
waste in landfills (Porter et al., 2018). In addition, food loss and waste has a direct negative impact on the income of 
producers and consumers (Thyberg and Tonjes, 2016). In addition to environmental and economic impacts, food loss 
and waste has a negative impact on food security (Mangla et al., 2018). 
As much as 44% of waste in Indonesia in 2018 was food waste. Indonesia is estimated to reach 300 kg per 
capita per year and is claimed to be the second largest producer of food loss and waste in the world (The Economist 
Intelligence Unit and Barilla Foundation, 2017). The environmental impact caused by food loss and waste in 2000 – 
2019 is that the total greenhouse gases are estimated at 1,702.9 Mt CO2-ek. The three main contributors to greenhouse 
gas emissions are food crop commodities, fisheries, and horticulture with each contributing an average of around 
39.67%, 22.32% and 20.21% (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2018). The incidence of food loss and waste in 
Indonesia is 23–48 million tons/year during 2000 – 2019. This has an impact on the occurrence of economic losses of

Abstract 
 
We present the results of a newsvendor experiment and out-of-experiment personality trait surveys. Our study is based 
on a simple scenario where the decision maker determines the stock quantity for a perishable product with stochastic 
consumer demand. We explore the predictive power of self-esteem and regret tendency on ordering behavior in 
newsvendor setting. We find that subjects with higher self-esteem scores place larger orders and earn more profit 
under low purchasing cost setting, whereas the difference is not salient under high purchasing cost setting. Moreover, 
decision-makers with higher regret tendency place orders with smaller variability and closer to the demand mean 
under high purchasing cost setting.

1. Introduction 
Owing to its intuitive problem structure; elegant and simple optimal solution; and applicability to a wide range of 
operations decision, the newsvendor model is one of the most common theoretical inventory control models. In this 
model a decision maker faced with stochastic consumer demand determines the order quantity of a perishable product 
that will maximize the expected profit over one selling season. Any products that are unsold at the end of the selling 
period lose their value and any unmet demand translates to lost sales. Hence the trade-off here is to order too much 
and risk leftovers or to order too little and lose potential profit. The optimal solution is obtained using the critical 
fractile, which is the ratio of unit cost of under-ordering to the sum of unit cost of under-ordering and over-ordering.  
 
Recently the theory of the classical newsvendor model has been challenged by various case studies and experimental 
investigations exhibiting that ordering decisions made by humans do not follow the theoretical expectations. On the 
contrary, there seems a systematic deviation in actual decisions from the theoretical optimal. This phenomenon has 
been investigated by Behavioral Operations researchers. Behavioral Operations is the field that studies human 
behavior under complex operations problems. Although lab experiments are not new to the field of operations 
management thanks to the famous beer distribution game, behavioral operations field gained a dramatic momentum 
with the experimental paper of Schweitzer and Cachon (2000) on newsvendor ordering behavior. This milestone 
article shows that even with formal training on the newsvendor model, human decision makers remarkably and 
consistently diverge from the optimal order decision. Specifically, the order decisions lay in between the optimal and 
the demand average. This pattern is named as “the pull-to-center effect” by Schweitzer and Cachon (2000). When 
purchasing cost is low, order decisions are lower than the optimal. Conversely, when purchasing cost is high decision 
makers order more than the optimal. Obviously, these deviations result in a significant suboptimality. 
 
As the newsvendor model is used in many more complicated supply chain coordination theory in the literature, these 
findings have severe implications on the practical efficiency of the inventory management and supply chain 
coordination theory. That is to say, if in practice the simplest model doesn’t perform as expected, then the whole 
supply chain coordination theory is in serious trouble. For this reason, since 2000 many researchers investigated the 
newsvendor behavior with the aim of uncovering the factors and conditions affecting the order decisions and what 
interference can be performed in order to move the decisions back to the optimal.

1445","incurring the loss due to unsold products is expected to be stronger under high purchasing cost setting. Therefore 
under high purchasing cost setting, subjects may be more prone to regret their ordering decisions or make ordering 
decisions that will minimize future regret.  
 
Overall, we can conclude that Hypothesis 2 is partially supported by the data. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Recent studies in behavioral operations and various case studies have revealed that despite formal training human 
subjects do not make the optimal order decision in practical newsvendor scenarios. This deviation results in significant 
suboptimality and profit loss for the companies. Hence, it is of crucial importance to identify the factors affecting 
ordering decisions and, if possible, to predict their effect and correct it. 
 
In this paper we explore the correlation between certain personality traits and newsvendor ordering decisions. We 
show that both self-esteem and regret tendency affect subject decisions significantly. The effect is asymmetrical with 
respect to the purchasing cost and hence our research hypotheses are partially supported by the data. However, it is 
worth noting that in our analysis 40 ordering decisions of each subject are averaged to obtain a single data point, which 
truncates the effects of personal factors. Additionally, subjects’ decisions are affected by the random consumer 
demand that is revealed after every ordering decision. Moreover, there are other factors which are not yet identified 
but still affect the ordering behavior. Hence the R2 values of the regression analyses are very low. As these other 
factors are identified and included into the analyses, it may be easier to detect the effect of personality traits. 
 
All in all, we believe we filled an existing gap in the behavioral operations literature by investigating the effects of 
self-esteem and regret tendency using out-of-experiment surveys.

Abstract 
 
This article to establish the link between economic and social factors and the provision of the formal justice service 
based on the official record of judicial process, entries and exits delivered by the Colombia Judicial Branch. To do it: 
first, provision justice service performance estimators was calculated focused on the efficiency and effectiveness in 
the operation of the system using DEA, Data Envelopment Analysis, techniques to obtain estimate data set that allow 
comparing the performance of the judicial system in Colombia as a measure of access to justice. Afterwards, the socio-
economic data was obtained as a way to dispose measurements about factors that could or could not impact the 
provision justice service performance estimators, those was done for 32 subnational divisions, departments, since 2010 
to 2015 annual reports. Subsequently, the correlation matrices between the efficiency aspects and the socioeconomic 
factors were identified as the way to estimate the relationship between factor variables of the social environment and 
provision justice service performance estimators, each subnational division has particular behavior each year, and will 
be used as scenario evolution in order to propose strategies to get away the service performance estimators to the 
efficient frontier.

1. Introduction 
The analysis of the provision of justice services has a long tradition (Monzingo   1977) in different international 
contexts including Latin America, and it is pertinent to evaluate the efficiency of the provision of justice services 
(Cohen, 2004). The evaluation may vary according to the available methods (Riley et al. 2015, Pérezy 2018, Christin 
et al. 2015, Ridgeway, 2018) among the techniques used to compare the relative efficiency of the performance of the 
justice service we find the Data Envelopment Analysis (Ferrandino  2013;  Ridgeway  2014;  Ferro et al. 2018).The 
provision of the justice service depends on access to judicial offices and their geographical location, as well as their 
efficiency (Teixeira et al.   2019) on the overflow and adaptation of the justice system to new circumstances such as 
transitional justice systems for special situations, little common or transitory such as the internal conflict in Colombia 
(Chenou et al.  2019). The literary review shows the importance of judges in Poland (Bełdowski et al.  2020) for the 
use of the stochastic borders method, the allocation of cases, resources and processes according to conditions and that 
today they can potentially be delegated to the machines (Simmons.  2018). 
 
From the Institutionalist perspective it is presumed that it is the institutions that build society and from the Structuralist 
perspective, it is the institutions and the dynamics that are the result of the social structure. Therefore, the identification 
of the sources of efficiency and inefficiency depend on the perspective assumed about the study of a justice system, 
thus the identification of the efficiency of justice in the construction of an economic system is relevant from the 
perspective institutionalist (Lorizioy  2014)  or it could be approached from the empirical approach, without a previous 
epistemological reference in the exploration of the sources of efficiency and inefficiency for judicial systems as is 
done for Italy (Finocchiaro  2014) This ideological effect on the selection, processing approach and treatment of 
judicial processes affects the performance and delivery of judgments within the courts  (Yates  et al. 2013), For its

6. Conclusion 
It was possible to estimate the performance measures of the provision of the jus-tice service focused on the efficiency 
and effectiveness in the operation of the sys-tem. Efficiency was analyzed using Little's Law, which allows studying 
the performance in operations of various systems through the flow of inventories, finding that the average times of 
judicial processes in general have decreased in the time horizon studied. The application of Litlle's Law and its variants 
allow establishing that the highest percentage value is evidenced in dead or queued cargo, which means that the service 
demanded by citizens is not being provided, only 4% are cases attended.

non-parametric technique was used Involvement Analysis of Data –DEA for its acronym in English– finding that they 
are located on the border. efficient in the departments of Antioquia, Bogotá, Quindío, Guainía, Vaupés and Vichada 
in some of the years this according to Farrel's efficiency, how-ever, accepting the Pareto-Koopmans concept, no DMU 
is really efficient in the peri-od of time studied . Therefore, based on the efficiency and effectiveness measures found, 
it can be ensured that Colombia is a country with a low level of access to jus-tice. 
 
Different techniques are recognized that allow determining relationships between variables such as Thaler's formula, 
Granger causality or correlation, but given the availability of data, Pearson's correlation is used, through which 874 
possible correlations are found. 
 
The Pearson correlation is established from two data sets: the DEA data and efficiency measures –19– and the 
socioeconomic variables –23–. Then the correlations with a significance level of 95% are identified and a diagram 
was prepared that summarizes the results of the correlations that identify the relationship between each pair of 
variables. The scenarios are therefore of a statistical nature by homogeneously identifying the most direct relationships 
from the correlations. 
 
From there, two major scenarios are established: first, the need for citizens to come to request the justice service, given 
a crime, since the various studies indicate that a high percentage do not attend due to ignorance or consider that they 
will not be at-tended to. Second, an improvement in social and economic conditions will allow citizens to enjoy their 
fundamental rights, thus reducing the burden within the system.

Abstract  
 
Logistics services are frequently provided with the use of means of transport on public roads where this road is shared 
with a wide variety of transport vehicles and road actors with pedestrians. Failures in vehicular and pedestrian 
management lead to accidents with tragic balances at times, such circumstances can be considered as sources of risk 
in logistics and transport activity. This work characterizes the Homicide caused by this accident for Colombia since 
2010 to 2020 based on available public information identifies the evolution and cyclicality of the accident rate for 
both motor vehicles and motorcycles. Her we can find the periodic components using Categorical Linear Regression.

1. Introduction  
The provision of logistics services is within the social environment in Colombia. The logistics services use motor 
vehicles and motorcycles to transport this cargo. The loss or impairment of functionalities of motor vehicles and 
motorcycles affects the provision of the logistics service. The National Police of Colombia has public databases with 
the registry of personal injuries, homicides due to traffic accidents; Information available for the period 2010 to 2020. 
This text describes the cyclicality of personal injuries, due to motor vehicles and motorcycles. For this it uses the 
public information available; then an ANOVA model is implemented using as a factor the year, the week of the year, 
the day of the week. In this way, methods are available to describe the evolution of the accident rate associated with 
personal injuries by motor vehicles and motorcycles and to anticipate possible changes in the road accident rate and 
the performance of the logistics systems used by these vehicles, as well as in each of selected country departments.  
 
1.1 Objectives  
Identify the weight of the temporal components in the behavior of personal injuries in Colombia from public 
information and describe the details for some territorial units, both for cars and motorcycles.

6. Conclusion  
This work uses the public information and a regression model is implemented using as a factor the year, the week of 
the year, the day of the week. In this way, the evolution of the accident rate associated with personal injuries by motor 
vehicles and motorcycles are find. 
The linear regression model with categorical variables is used for each year and each month within each language, so 
the statistics are presented in both Table 10 and Table 11. From there it is identified that the models capture between 
19% and 45% of the variability total information this in the adjusted coefficient of determination.  
It is identifying that 46.51% and 51.2% of the total information for personal injuries with a motorcycle and vehicle 
for Colombia can be based on the date; in the same way, we can observe that the explanation of the date depends of 
the region.  On the other hand, always higher values of the Bayesian Information Criterion, SBC, are obtained with 
respect to the Aikake Information Criterion, which indicates a good fit of the proposed models. As they are categorical 
unsaturated models, a quasi-orthogonal design matrix is obtained, with which there are no multicollinearity effects, 
given the selection of the data, implying an adaptation of the estimators by ordinary least squares, which is the model 
used.

Abstract  
 
This text describes the evolution of the crime of homicide at the sub-national level, departmental level, for Colombia 
from years 2010 to 2020 based on open data from Statistics System of the Colombian National Police, SIEDCO, 
characterizing the behavior and cyclicality within each of the sub-national territories over time considering the 
differentiated temporal evolution in each of the territorial units. For this, linear regressions are used with categorical 
variables for time for each year. There it is found the simultaneity or similarity between the behavior of the 32 
territories and time. Subsequently, the statistically significant correlation coefficients between the territories are 
obtained. The differences and similarities between the territories are found, with this coefficient the direction or type 
of evolution is identified and through this the similarity in the evolution trend is identified. Since the coefficients 
discriminate the effect and correlation between these coefficients identifies the projection between each pair of 
territorial data series and its evolution over time.

1. Introduction  
The crimes could or could not be the same across time and space. Here we find this communalities and differences 
between: year, weeks, and days, for each of 32 subnational divisions to criminal murder in Colombia since 2010 to 
2020. For it first use departmental murder crime diary time series; aftermath over general lineal model regression we 
find statistical coefficients, after this we use correlation and regression between annual, monthly, and diary coefficients 
 
1.1 Objectives  
Identify the evolution in crime of homicide for each territory with respect to time or date and with respect to the 
evolution of the other territorial units or departments based on the aggregation of homicide records as a source of open 
data.

6. Conclusion 
Murders can be characterized by temporal variables as year, week of the year and day of the week. All constructed 
models are significant, and those can be used to improve resources planning of police force. Much of murders at 
subterritorial unit level are strong correlated and that result can be used also for enhancing the understanding of the 
homicide phenomena.

Abstract 
 
One of the best methods to deliver your costumers’ demand is to use manufacturing or machining cells to produce in 
large scale with a high product mix. To maximize production and serve the demand, the challenge is to balance labors 
and manufacturing capability. As the system can be very complex, one approach is to simulate the whole system and 
observe how it behaves, monitoring cell’s cycle time, the workflow and the WIP inventory. Then it is possible to find 
out if the current cycle time attends our current customers’ demand. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate, by 
using the digital twin software Flexsim, a gear machining cell from a global technology company, located in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, that supplies transmissions systems for light and heavy vehicles.

Abstract  
 
Worm gears are used in industries where fast stopping and breaking applications such as lifts, hoists, and elevators. 
Worm gears are also used in machine tools. Worm gear sets are typically used in the gearbox. Worm gear motors offer 
quietness when compared to other types of equipment. They require small gearboxes, and they are increasingly used 
in space-saving applications. Inspection of worm gears is significant before they are deployed into service. This would 
ensure that they will not fail when put into service. Many of the existing gear inspection techniques are post-process 
in nature, and hence they are not fit for 100% inspection of gears. The current research work attempts to design and 
develop a novel approach for the non-contact assessment of worm gears using a vision system. Validation of the 
results obtained by the current method is done by comparing them with the results of the standard technique. As far 
as the author’s knowledge goes, no research article reported on the worm gear inspection using a vision system. In 
this context, the present research assumes special significance. The accuracy obtained by the current process is 98%. 
The method has shown very high repeatability. The way finds application in the online inspection of worm gears. The 
research investigation revealed that the technique could detect damaged teeth and other defects such as Wear, scoring, 
pitting, and fracture, with a classification accuracy of 93.33%, 94.66%, 94%, 94.66%, and 100%, respectively.

1. Introduction 
 
Worm and Worm wheel is being used in multiple applications such as lifts, hoists, elevators, machine tools, etc. In 
machine tools, they are used in drives for rotary indexing tables. This application requires high positioning accuracy, 
and elimination of backlash is critical. They are also used in turbine governor drives. Worm gears are now being made 
by additive manufacturing. Worm gears are generally used for transmitting motion when the shafts are nonparallel. 
Worm gears can be used up to 24000 rpm. The main advantage of worm gears is that they operate quietly when put 
into service. And they have a very high gear reduction ratio and occupy less space. Hence significant speed reductions 
are possible using worm and worm wheel in a single stage.  A worm wheel is usually made using brass, and the worm 
is made using steel. Worms are generally made harder than worm wheels.  This will prevent wear on the worm. The 
main problem with worm gears is that it is tough to lubricate. This is because the movement between worm and worm 
wheel is entirely sliding. Also, the lubricants used with the worm wheel require very high viscosity. This makes 
filtering fats a big challenge. Also, viscosity is the main factor that prevents the worm from touching the worm wheel 
in a worm gear set. ISO 460 and ISO 680 are the most commonly used lubricants in the worm gear set. In many 
applications related to worm gear sets, mineral-based compounded gear oils. The lubricants prevent the sliding wear 
of the worm gear set. Thus, by using lubricants, direct metal-to-metal contact may be prevented. Some applications 
use additives such as natural or synthetic fatty acids to increase lubrication efficiency. Mineral oil-based extreme 
pressure oil is also being used in some applications Polyalphaolefin provides excellent lubrication with a worm gear 
set. Polyalkylene glycols are also being used as a lubricant in worm gear sets. The worm wheel wears out more quickly 
than the worm in a worm gear set.  This is because the worm wheel is made out of softer material. Using a sulfur-
phosphorous EP gear oil at high temperatures might activate EP additives. When EP additive starts will cause an oxide 
layer will form on the steel worm, which will protect the gear tooth from shock loads. On the other hand, the EP

5.Conclusion and directions for further research 
The present research focuses on inspecting the worm and worm wheel using a vision system. The method presented 
here is non-contact type. The process is quick. The results obtained by the current approach were validated by 
comparing the results obtained from the conventional gear measuring instruments. The experimental investigation 
showed that the accuracy of the proposed method is 98%. The experiments were performed with the same specimen, 
and it was noticed that the repeatability of the current process is 99%. The research investigation revealed that the 
method could detect damaged teeth and other defects such as Wear, scoring, pitting, and fracture, with a classification 
accuracy of 93.33%, 94.66%, 94%, 94.66%, and 100%, respectively.

Abstract 
 
 Spur gears are employed for transferring both motion and power from driver shaft to driven shaft. The performance 
of Spur gears largely depends upon its design and construction. Thus there is a need for inspecting spur gear before 
deployment. During the inspection, a spur gear will be checked for pitch circle, diametral pitch, center distance, outside 
diameter, etc. Many techniques have been proposed by researchers for the measurement of gear elements. Many of 
these techniques are contact-based and are fit for sampling inspection. These techniques are not amenable to 
automation. Sampling inspection techniques are not fool-proof. With the advent of 3D printing and Industry 4.0, there 
is a thrust is toward 100% inspection. This has necessitated the need for designing and developing new inspection 
techniques for measuring spur gear elements in real-time. In the present research, an attempt has been made to design 
and develop a new non-contact and online, technique for inspecting spur gears in real-time. The measurements made 
by using the proposed method are validated by standard methods and are in good agreement.

1.Introduction 
In mechanical systems such as automobiles, machine tools, etc., different types of gears are used for transferring both 
motion and power. Spur gears are employed for transferring both motion and power from driver shaft to driven shaft. 
Gears of different sizes are being used in machine tools, Aerospace, Gear pumps, Automobiles, etc. The performance 
of spur gears largely depends upon their design and construction. Thus, there is a need for inspecting spur gear before 
deployment. During the inspection, a spur gear will be checked for pitch circle, diametral pitch, center distance, 
module, circular pitch, etc. (Ansi/Agma 2015). They are defined as follows. 
 
module =
reference diameter (d)
number of teeth (z)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
diametral pitch =
number of teeth (z)
reference diameter (d) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
cicular pitch =
circumference
number of teeth (z) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) 
Different types of testing are carried out in industries, before releasing the gear for deployment. So that, the gear 
functions as per the expectations set by the designer. Accuracy of the spur gear elements determines the functional 
performance and service life. 
   
2.Literature Review 
Traditionally, gear measurements can be broadly classified into analytical and functional. In the analytical method, 
gear elements are checked for compliance with the design specification (Ni et al. 2021). These techniques are mostly 
manual and make use of several instruments and they are time-consuming. Functional testing involves rolling the gear 
to be inspected in tight mesh with that of the master gear. If certain gear parameters of test gear are not as per design 
specifications, when the two gears are rolled, there will be variation in the center distance (Goch et al.  2003). This 
variation in the center distance is a composite effect of variation in tooth profile, pitch, tooth thickness, and runout 
error. The advantage of functional gear testing is that it is very quick (Goch et al. 2006, Martin et al. 2021). The 
limitation of this technique is that it requires further analysis.

The accuracy of the proposed method is 94%. The method was tested for repeatability and has shown a repeatability 
error of ± 5.14%. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The present research work demonstrates a novel technique for the inspection of Spur gears. The method makes use of 
a Vision system for acquiring images of the Gears. These images are then processed for image quality enhancement. 
Then the images are used for computing the following Gear parameters. 
 
a. 
Gear tooth thickness 
b. 
Gear pitch 
c. 
Gear profile 
The method also does gear profile as well as texture analysis through GLCM.  The method is also capable of 
classifying gears into Good/Bad/Rework categories. 
Thus, the proposed method is a non-contact means of comprehensively inspecting a Spur gear, in a single set-up. The 
method finds application in the online inspection of Gears. The classification accuracy was 94%. The method was 
tested for repeatability and has shown a repeatability error of ± 5.14%.

Abstract  
 
A phishing email is a crime where a scammer sends an email to get sensitive data.  Everyday phishing email attacks 
impact billions of people worldwide.  Understanding the factors that lead to phishing email clicks is essential to combat 
this threat.  Another area that targets email clicks is email marketing, a commercial message sent to people by email. 
This work considers that scammers can be using marketing techniques in phishing emails. However, little or no 
research was developed to investigate if the factors that impact email marketing clicks can also impact phishing email 
clicks.  In this research, we developed the Persuasive Usability Framework (PUF), designed with the best practices of 
marketing and phishing.  Now, we want to determine which factors included in PUF have a significant effect on 
phishing email CR.  To address the research problem, we will survey 400 participants in a role-play job function in 
which they review emails and process sensitive information.  We expect this research to contribute to understanding 
the factors that significantly affect phishing email CR, which is relevant for training people to identify phishing emails 
better.

ABSTRACT 
This presentation is aimed at reviewing the current approaches, practices and methods in cost engineering. Given the 
complexity of any product design endeavor it is paramount to have accurate cost data to fully understand the costs 
involved for the creation of a cost estimate prior to the start of the design phase. The three principal areas reviewed 
cost engineering methods, cost engineering practitioners and cost or product cost management systems. 
The literature is rich with studies and reviews on cost engineering methods such as activity-based costing, standard 
costing, value costing as well as many others, so this presentation will discuss the current state of each these 
methods. What is more difficult to find in literature is the role of cost engineering practitioners in design project 
methodologies that may be associated with DFSS or other DfX practices. 
The third approach to be review is the newest player in cost engineering – product or cost management systems 
(PCM or CMS). These systems can provide immediate access to costs relating to the sourcing of parts and materials, 
labor rates for different skills and locations, manufacturing costs for different processes as well as other costs needed 
for decision making. 
This paper is the result of an extensive literature review of peer reviewed journal articles that have been published in 
journals related to how cost data is developed, maintained, and then used in projects that create new products and the 
re-design of existing products.

Abstract  
 
The case of Rachel Vennya's alleged escape from quarantine after returning from America which was allegedly 
assisted by TNI (Indonesian Army) personnel reported in October caused pros and cons among the people of 
Indonesia. The problem studied in this study is how CNN Indonesia framed the news on the case of Rachel Vennya's 
escape. This research uses qualitative methods. In this study, data was taken by downloading news related to Rachel 
Vennya's escape which was published on the CNN Indonesia portal.  This study also used Robert Entman's framing 
analysis to obtain the results of news framing that became the object of research. The results showed that CNN 
Indonesia is focused on developing cases from upstream to downstream. The reportage carried out by CNN Indonesia 
is neutral and there is no partisanship to the victim or related agencies.

1. Introduction  
The case of Rachel Vennya's alleged escape, which was allegedly assisted by indonesian national army (TNI) 
personnel reported in October, raised pros and cons among the Indonesian people. This case started from the upload 
of one of the netizens who said that he served at the Wisma Atlet Pademangan. The news then spread on one of the 
Twitter accounts, namely @AREAJULID which contained a screenshot of a confession from one of the Wisma Atlet 
officers. It was stated that the officer input Rachel Vennya's data and asked to be in the same room with her boyfriend. 
The Commander of the Jayakarta Military Region (Kodam Jaya) confirmed that Rachel Vennya escaped from 
quarantine after returning from New York, United States. According to reports, Rachel Vennya escaped assisted by 
two TNI members who violated the Covid-19 quarantine provisions and from the results of the investigation it is true 
that the two people were the ones who helped Rachel. It is also known that the two individuals are members of the 
TNI who serve at Soekarno Hatta Airport and serve at the Wisma Atlet RSDC (Herwin  2021). 
 
The media also reported that Rachel was only in quarantine for three days. This was revealed after a netizen with a 
Twitter account @cleverdid who said that Rachel only underwent a three-day quarantine which should have been 8 
days. From this tweet, this incident became crowded among the Indonesian people. The fact revealed that celebgram 
Rachel Vennya admitted that she did not undergo quarantine at all at Wisma Atlet Hospital (Chairul Fikri  2021). This 
fact was corroborated by Rachel's appearance on Boy William's YouTube channel, Rachel said ""I'm not quarantining 
at all at the Wisma Atlet"".

1504","confirmed that the two members of the Air Force 
would be acted firmly if found guilty in rachel's case. 
""If found guilty, it will be acted firmly in accordance 
with the provisions of the applicable law,"" Indan said in 
his statement, Thursday (4/11). 
Diagnose Causes 
There is a difference in perspective on this news which 
further explains the views of two parties, namely from 
Rachek's lawyer and the follow-up tni with the initials 
FS who aided get Rachel out. 
Make Moral Judgement 
The problem in this news shows the other side of the 
magnitude of the role of the media and how the 
influence of framing in reporting the development of a 
case, here it is shown that there is already a cover 
where the perpetrator who helped has been caught and 
Rachel has received punishment, including social 
punishment. 
Treatment Recomendation 
The problem was closed with a criminal sentence of 4 
months in prison and a fine of 50 rupiah and FS was 
deactivated by Pangdam Jaya Mayjend. Mulyo Aji after 
the thanksgiving event of Brigav 1 Limpung Alugoro 
Headquarters in North Serpong, South Tangerang. 
 
In the headline 6 ""Suspect Status, Rachel Vennya Will Be Examined by the Police Today"" there are several views 
on this news that further explain the views of both parties, namely from Rachel's own lawyer and how to follow up 
for the TNI with the initials FS who aided get Rachel out. In addition, it is also clear that the punishment received by 
FS is disabled and Rachel is in the form of direct criminal punishment and social punishment where she experiences 
cancel culture.  From the 6th news, the case of Rachel Vennya's escape from quarantine has developed until she is 
determined as a suspect. Thus, the framing perspective of the news highlights the punishment received by Rachel 
Vennya as well as the punishment to the TNI person with the initials FS. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research from the analysis of the news of rachel Vennya's escape from quarantine after returning 
from America shows that CNN Indonesia is focused on developing cases from upstream to downstream. From the six 
news, the tendency of CNN Indonesia's reporting is to focus on the development of cases ranging from alleged of the 
person to the determination of suspects. This can be seen from the relevant agencies in the follow-up regarding the 
truth and investigating the FS who allegedly helped Rachel Vennya. This news spread very quickly among the people 
of Indonesia because Rachel Vennya is a selebgram who became an interesting topic to be used as a headline news. 
So, the emergence of cancel culture where is a factor that makes the case quickly spread widely. The findings of the 
investigation confirmed that CNN Indonesia had been framing the case of Rachel Vennya's escape from quarantine

Abstract  
 
Wear is a dynamic and complex process that involves not only surface and material properties but operating 
conditions as well. Wearing of surfaces may lead to extra cost of maintenance or manufacturing process. This paper 
presents the design and fabrication of a dual condition PIN-ON-DISC wear testing machine. The machine is used to 
compute both the dry and lubricated surface contact of engineering material. The surface wear of Aluminum 6061 
pin was examined together with the performance test based on different loads, speeds and time. The paper also 
analyzed the wear resistance, pin wear rate, and specific wear rate of the pin of Aluminum 6061. During the 
experiment, the pin was subjected to different performance test at constant sliding speeds of 0.158m/s at the forces 
of 5N. The testing the pin was removed after 300 seconds and the final volume of the pin was computed. The results 
indicates a wearing rate per second under applied force of 5N at 0.158m/s sliding speed of 4mm diameter Aluminum 
6061 pin during lubricated condition as 20.5𝜇𝜇𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚3/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚. Using the pin-on-disc designed by this study, the lubricated 
surface reduces wear to 54%. At sliding speed of 0.158m/s and sliding distance of 568.8m, the specific wear rate of 
4mm diameter pin with lubricated surface has least wearing rate. The specific wear rate test of the Aluminum 6061 
pin was 0.2428 × 10−3mm3/Nm. The contribution of this research will greatly profits indigenous Material design 
and Tribology technology.

1. Introduction  
 
The PIN-ON-DISC wear test is a method of characterizing the frictional force and its coefficient and the rate of wear 
between the contacting surfaces of materials (Abdul et al., 2015). During the test, the weight loss is continuously 
measured and stored and the wear rate is calculated. 
 
According to Abdul et al. (2015), pin wear tester is essential to the development of innovative and enhanced cost-
effective applications in engineering design. For example, design of frictional and wearing forces of the materials in 
contact. The purpose of pin wear tester research is to minimize or eradicate losses available from wear and friction 
of engineering material surface (Saleh et al. 2021). 
 
Tribology is a study of friction, wear and lubrication between two interacting surfaces in relative motion and of 
relative subjects and practices (John, 2008). It includes the study and application of the principles of friction, 
lubrication and wear. Tribology is a branch of mechanical engineering (Saleh, et al., 2021). The tribological 
interactions of a solid surface's exposed face with interfacing materials and environment may result in loss of 
material from the surface. The process leading to loss of material is known as ""wear"" (Amit Swamy et al. 2022). 
Major types of wear include abrasion, friction (adhesion and cohesion), erosion, and corrosion. Wear can be

6. Conclusion  
 
The paper designed and fabricated a dual operational pin-on-disc wear testing machine. This machine can be used in 
the workshop for the analysis of surface wear on engineering material. The machine can be used on the dry, wet or 
lubricated surface contact of disc and pin. It has ability of 40mm and 50mm disc wear track, respectively. It was 
used for speed variation during experiment on the Aluminum 6061 for the wear parameters investigation.   
The performance analysis was conducted for the surface wear behavior of the Aluminum 6061 pin. During the 
experiment, the pin was subjected to applied force of 5N at the interval of 300s and sliding speed of 0.518m/s. The 
findings indicates that increase in force increase the rate of wear at a fixed speed. With increase, the rate of wear is 
reduced. Also, the increase in surface area of contact and using a lubricated surface lead to wear reduction rate.

Abstract 
 
Logistics hub location problem is a trending topic both academically and among competing countries. Many authors 
were interested in selecting this kind of problems and especially in the last 20 years. However, most of the published 
works were focused on improving and developing solution techniques rather than implementing those techniques into 
real-life cases. Thus, only limited number of literatures had considered real-life aspects in locating logistics hubs 
within specific regions. 15 papers were found to be relevant with 3 main families of implemented tools and techniques 
in several different regions. Tools like spatial modeling and optimization modeling were usually linked with macro 
level allocation phases, while ordering and ranking criteria are usually applied on micro level phases to select set of 
alternatives or arrange/sort them according to some determined factors. This paper aims to analyze and benchmark 
different practical cases, and illustrate the use of different allocation models.

1. Introduction 
Being a global logistics hub is a strategic goal for most of the developed countries since it has a major positive 
influence on the country’s economy. Attracting foreign direct investments and creating job opportunities are examples 
of the benefits that would be generated as consequence of realizing such a strategic goal. 
 
Locating regional logistics hubs and effectively utilize them may ultimately serve the strategic goal of transforming 
the whole country to a global logistics hub. This paper analyzes the academic trend of this topic and reviews the most 
relevant academic practical cases including their implemented tools and techniques. A systematic based searching 
methodology will be considered to gather the most relevant practical cases before reviewing each practical case and 
benchmark the common usable academic tools and techniques which were applied on real life case studies. 
 
Next section illustrates the full methodological approach which was used to collect and benchmark different academic 
relevant articles in a systematic procedure. Following section details the implementation strategy which includes 
analyzing the academic trends and presenting the results. Conclusion and authors’ point of views will be discussed in 
section.

1535","Weighting, ordering and selecting techniques are usually used to arrange set of alternatives based on subject matter 
experts’ judgment or pre-defined criteria. S. Shahparvari et al. implement multiple decision-making methods such as 
Delphi weighting criteria, VIKOR ranking criteria and PROMETHEE ranking criteria (Shahparvari et al.  2020). 
 
R. Maharjan and S. Hanaoka implement a fuzzy factor rating system (FFRS) considering a group of decision makers 
to determine the weights of the two early considered objectives (Maharjan & Hanaoka  2018). X. Zhang et al. rely 
heavily on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques by using a grey area relational analysis-technique for 
order preference by similarity to ideal solution GARA-TOPSIS in combination with analytic hierarchy process (AHP), 
entropy method and game theory (Zhang et al.  2021). 
 
L. Zhao et al. integrate the existing metro network with the last mile delivery services through a segmentation model 
followed by decision making methods such as AHP and TOPSIS. 
 
Even though, the keyword “location” was considered earlier in the search, few articles were found to be irrelevant to 
the logistics hubs location problems. R.A. Kirkland relies on surveys methodology to study and examine the 
relationship between transforming into global logistics hub and the improvement of the agritourism sub-sector 
(Kirkland  2017). I. El-Nakib uses similar questionaries’-based methodology to select the most suitable location for a 
regional distribution center (RDC) considering multiple factors (El-Nakib  2010). “South African perspective on 
freight logistics hubs” is another article where G. de Villiers presents a real life implemented case study in a form of 
briefing rather than academically discussing and detailing the methodology (de Villiers  2013). propose a statistical 
based approach that compares the logistics costs of routings and highlights ports in Eastern Africa as potential hubs 
(Haralambides et al.  2011). C. Zhen and L. Yingjin wrote a very complex article where the considered tools are hard 
to define and the flow of context is hard to follow (Zhen & Yingjin  2013). use simulation model to improve the 
logistics processes of parts manufacturing company. C.S. Liu et al. studied the As-Is situation and suggest a To-Be 
model that enhance the logistics cost and the lead time (Liu et al.  2008). 
 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, logistics hubs became more and more attractive in the last 20 years. Many researchers considered this 
topic and tried to design or develop methodologies for hubs location allocation. However, only few practical cases 
were implemented and tested in realistic scenarios. Asian countries have the highest frequency of implemented cases 
which indicates the current logistics development among those countries. Most of the relevant practical cases consider 
one, two or all of the following solving models and those include spatial modeling, optimization modeling and 
decision-making methodologies. Spatial model might be really effective as first phase whenever the feasible space is 
widely spread, while optimization models can be used as a single method which might solve the whole problem and 
lead to optimum or near optimum solution. Lastly, decision making methodologies could be used in many scenarios 
and whenever there is a lack of data, set of alternatives need to be ranked or very complex problem which is hard to 
be mathematically formulated.

Abstract 
This study is intended to investigate the relationship between bank liquidity, asset quality and capital adequacy in 
determining financial performance in the banking industry in Indonesia with a minimum core capital of IDR 5 trillion 
in 2015 to 2019. This paper identifies the extent to which bank liquidity can have an impact on the financial 
performance in banking industry. And analyzing the extent to which asset quality has an impact on the bank's financial 
performance. Also how is the role of capital in mediating the relationship between liquidity and asset quality of 
banking industry with the financial performance of the lowest core capital of IDR 5 trillion during 2015 to 2019. 
Evidence shows that asset quality has impact on financial performance, liquidity has a significant effect on banking 
financial performance. Asset quality and liquidity has high effect on the capital adequacy respectively, financial 
performance determinant also depends on the capital regulatory of banks, then the indirect analysis results show that 
the capital adequacy managed to mediate the relationship between asset quality and financial performance 
however, the capital reserve has weak intervening in the relationship between liquidity and financial performance 
through.

1. Introduction 
Banking sector has been giving major contributions to the development of economic in many countries, including 
emerging economy like Indonesia. To enable them to leverage more, banking industry has been focusing to attain and 
maintain their financial performance. Bankers and many analysts have always been focused on creating expansion; 
yet not all growth delivers long-term value or profitability for banks. According to some, industry estimates roughly 
up to 40% of a bank's customers may be unprofitable to the organization. This highlights the complexity of efficiently 
measuring and managing their financial performance, since bankers must have a comprehensive understanding of 
which clients, channels, branches, and products provide the most value. In Indonesia, according to Bank Indonesia 
Circular 2019 period, ROA data from 2015 to 2016 showed a decrease from 2.08% to 1.90%, then in 2017 it No. 
6/23/DPNP dated 31 May 2004 financial performance in banking can be measure through profitability using the ROA 
ratio. As in the return on asset (ROA) of banking companies in BUKU 1 – BUKU 4 for the 2015 - increased with an  
average value of 2.23%. In 2018 there was an increase again with a figure of 2.35% and in 2019 it decreased again 
with a figure 2x lower than the previous years with an average value of 1.85%.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents an analysis of the literature concerning whether environmental performance can improve financial 
performance of Manufacturing Companies in the Miscellaneous Industry Participating in Performance Rating Rating 
Program in Environmental Management PROPER. Then look at the extent to which the role of corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) can strengthen the relationship between environmental performance and financial performance 
of companies in the manufacturing sector and various industries. The sample we use in this study are manufacturing 
companies in the Miscellaneous Industry listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and participating in PROPER 
for the 2016-2019 period with 16 observations. In conducting data analysis, we applied WarpPLS version 7.0 software 
which will evaluate the outer model and inner model. The company's financial performance variables are measured 
using the return on equity (ROE) and net profit margin (NPM) ratios, while the environmental performance variable 
is measured using the PROPER rating and CSR is measured by the CSR index. The provisional assumption of this 
study shows that (1) environmental performance cannot improve the financial performance of companies in the 
manufacturing sector and various industries, (2) CSR disclosure is not able to strengthen the relationship between 
environmental performance and the financial performance of companies in the manufacturing sector and various 
industries.

1.Introduction  
Financial performance has become the main thing in conducting an appraisal of a company. From a financial 
perspective, financial performance based on profit is an indicator of measuring success. With these indicators the 
company can review and evaluate the results obtained, so that the company knows the prospects of the company in 
the coming period and as an effort to maintain the sustainability of the company. Thus, financial performance is also 
a determinant of the company's life. Developing business strategies to do ""well"" by doing ""good"" and transforming 
corporations into responsible organizations that care about the environment, as well as the social component, is 
increasingly becoming a must rather than an option to lead in future markets. Companies must not just seek financial 
gain, but also consider the ecological and social context. To put it another way, the corporation should be focused on 
the triple bottom line notion, which incorporates financial (profit), social (people), and environmental considerations 
(planet) (UY and Hendrawati  2020). Corporate sustainability is transforming a company's financial bottom line into 
a triple bottom line that includes environmental and social factors (Albertini  2013). The ability of a corporation to 
design a solid business strategy is becoming increasingly dependant on how well it places itself in terms of long-term 
development that balances financial, environmental, and human development (Shank and Shockey  2016). Through 
the adoption of corporate social responsibility, a firm not only acts for the benefit of shareholders, but also for the 
interests of stakeholders in business processes (CSR). CSR activity is based on the legitimacy theory, which states 
that the company will continue to work to ensure that it has operated in accordance with the rules and norms prevailing 
in the society or environment in which it is located, and that its operational activities will be accepted as ""legitimate""

1558",,"stakeholder theory and the legitimacy theory have been rejected. Within the agency framework, we believe our 
evidence is ambiguous because investors appear to overlook superior governance and CSR practices in the 
manufacturing and miscellaneous sectors. 
 
According to the guidance on ESG‐ related risks published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (COSO‐WBCSD, 2018), in the 
business world, the awareness of ESG‐related risks that were once considered as uncommon issues is becoming 
stronger than ever. 
 
Our study has some limitations. first, the sample has only 16 manufacturing in miscellaneous industry, which may be 
considered a small sample. Second, we just apply one dimension in environment, that it will be better if social and 
governance dimensions included in the future study. The limitation in econometric model can be expanded by 
considering industry factor, macroeconomic and other internal factor such as the size of the company, the valuation 
of stock, and company value. More research is needed to identify and classify appropriate corporate financial 
measurements, as well as how they relate to sustainability policies. Finally, more research is needed to investigate the 
influence of total sustainability in order to determine the combined impact of all three characteristics. This is necessary 
not only to increase our understanding of the link between corporate sustainability and financial performance, but also 
to lessen the disparity between theory and results.

Abstract 
 
Printed circuit boards are used in electronic devices such as digital cameras, computers, etc. With time, many 
components are being added to the printed circuit board, and hence the density of members and the manufacturing 
tolerance is also increasing. This has resulted in the increased demand for inspection techniques as well. One such 
requirement is 100% inspection. The inspection technique should be quick and complete the inspection process as fast 
as possible. The main objective of inspecting the printed circuit board is to assess defects, cracks, missing components, 
etc. An attempt has been made in the present research work to set printed circuit boards using a vision system. The 
method not only does the classification of PCB into known defect classes but also locates the position of the defect 
and measures the associated dimensions. The method is quick and finds application in the 100% inspection of printed 
circuit boards.

1. Introduction 
With the demand for refrigerators, computers, digital cameras, washing machines, and other products increasing, it 
necessitates the production of quality printed circuit boards.  Inspection of printed circuit boards is becoming very 
challenging. The number of components present on the printed circuit board increases and the tolerance of the various 
parts grows. In addition, PCB manufacturers have to deliver quality printed circuit boards in a short lead time. This 
aspect also places the need for the design and development of quick, non-contact, accurate, and robust inspection 
techniques suitable for online and 100% inspection of printed circuit boards. The significance of printed circuit board 
inspection is that the board will function satisfactorily when put into service. Many researchers have been working in 
PCB inspection (Oguz et al. 1991, Moganti et al. 1996, Sasai et al. 2000, Mashohor 2004, Greenberg et al. 2006). PCB 
inspection technique in which the actual image is compared with the standard image for identifying defects is known 
as the referential method. In the non-referential process, the actual image is assessed by referring to the design 
specifications. Some inspection techniques use both referential and non-referential methods (Mashohor 2004). A 
printed circuit board may consist of various defects such as fractures, cuts, scratches, cracks, pinholes, spurs/ or 
protrusions, variations between printed lines, etc. Many of these defects can be broadly classified into fatal and non-
fatal classes. Many researchers have proposed methods for PCB inspection not with complete success (Capson 1988, 
Nakagawa 1982). If a printed circuit board is deployed without assessment may lead to board failure and a short 
circuit. This shows the importance of PCB inspection. In this research work, an attempt is made to design and develop 
a vision-based inspection procedure for printed circuit boards. 
 
2. Methods 
The method proposed in the current research work uses a vision system to acquire printed circuit boards. The technique 
uses a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera having a resolution of 1600x1236 pixels. The camera is connected to a 
server fitted with a dual monitor system. The specimen (printed circuit board) is mounted on the mount table and 
illuminated by diffused lighting during the experiment. The image of the specimen is stored on the server’s hard disk. 
The above procedure is repeated, taking one specimen at a time. Thus, all the images of various specimens are captured 
and stored for further analysis. During image capture, there can be multiple types of noise affecting the quality of the 
image. Hence, the captured images are subjected to pre-processing.

‘Distance Variation.’ In contrast, ‘2’ images were classified as belonging to the ‘Pinholes’ class, and ‘5’ images 
belonged to the class ‘Protrusions.’ Thus, the classification accuracy was 95.33%. 
 
3. Conclusion 
The method proposed in the current research uses a Vision system for identifying defects in the PCB images. The 
technique identifies various defects in the printed circuit board, such as fractures, cuts, scratches, cracks, pinholes, 
spurs/ or protrusions, and variations between printed lines. The method is quick and finds application in the online 
inspection of the printed circuit boards. The technique can also identify defects with the given tolerance, and the 
method’s accuracy is very high in identifying deficiencies in subpixel accuracy. The technique is also robust in terms 
of providing consistent results. The meth identifies the various types of defects and locates the defect's position, and 
measures the associated dimensions.

Abstract 
Diesel is the main fuel for use in industrial, transport, and in diesel power plants; unfortunately, it is polluting and 
non-renewable. The overall objective of this study is to assess the sustainability of converting diesel power plants 
to dual fuel power plants which use both diesel or heavy fuel oil and gas. The study showed that the use of natural 
gas simultaneously reduces the cost of generation per kilowatt hour (kWh) and emissions, particularly SOX. The 
conversion process involves modification of the fuel injection system to cope with new fuel injection and ignition 
requirements, new control for fuel injection and reduced air to fuel ratio and lowering of the engines’ compression 
ratios through increase of the engine cylinder clearance volume. These fuel savings will influence renegotiation 
of the power purchase agreement resulting into lower tariffs, higher load factor and power plant utilization which 
translates to more revenue and reduced unit cost of power with lower environmental impact as well as better return 
on investment from the largest grid connected diesel power plant in East and Central Africa. This study showed 
that dual fuel diesel power plants running on both natural gas and diesel exhibit better performance indicators in 
terms of engine specific fuel consumption, engine brake thermal efficiency, diesel engine indicated thermal 
efficiency, the power plant electricity generating unit cost of power, the total engine emissions and hence leading 
to less environmental impact. 
Key Words: Diesel engines; diesel power plants; gas engines; gas power plants; power plant design. 
1. Introduction 
Diesel engines operate at a relatively higher efficiency and with a higher power density than petrol making them 
the best choice as prime movers in transport especially heavy-duty vehicles and in diesel power generation.  The 
engines are also increasingly finding application in light-duty cars are dominated by petrol or gasoline engines. 
The main challenge of using  diesel engines in  power generation is the emissions mainly in the form of carbon 
dioxide, NOx due to oxidation of nitrogen in the air at high combustion temperatures., particulate matter (PM) 
and sulphur dioxide from oxidation of sulphur component of the fuel (IEA, 2021; Kabeyi & Oludolapo, 2020a, 
2020f).The changing climatic conditions, strict environmental regulations, high cost of diesel power generation  
and general sustainability concerns have created need for cleaner and cheaper fuels for diesel power plants (Arefin 
et al., 2020). In diesel Power generation stations, diesel engines are used as prime movers for  generators  (Kabeyi 
& Olanrewaju, 2020b). Diesel engines remain competitive for power generation because of their high full load 
and partial load brake thermal efficiency compared to many other prime movers. They are also quick to start and 
stop and have got capacity to burn different types of fuels (Niemi, 1997).  The engine market is large with over 
20 manufacturers of  piston diesel engines for power generation generally between 10 hp  to 140 hp (Andriulli et 
al., 1999). For a long time, many developing countries like Kenya rely on hydropower for its bulk electricity 
generation for its grid electricity (Kabeyi, 2020b; Kabeyi & Oludolapo, 2021a). This comes with low reliability 
due to seasonal variability of rainfall hence power plant availability. The need to meet the deficit occasioned by 
low rains or drought conditions create demand for  expensive and polluting thermal power plants (Andae, 2017). 
It is because of this challenge that Kenya decided to build the largest diesel engine power plant in East and Central 
Africa, named Kipevu III in Mombasa, Kenya. The main challenges of diesel power plants are high and fluctuating 
fuel cost and high cost of plant operation and maintenance per unit power output. Therefore, as the  global 
community looks  for a cheaper, cleaner and sustainable energy production, natural gas has emerged as an 
alternative fuel in power production (Munde & Dalu, 2012). The use of natural gas as a fuel in power generation

Abstract  
 
Nowadays, the internet and social media cannot be separated from people's lives. Especially during the Pandemic 
Covid-19 that force our society to move their social life into digital. Internet and the social media have become the 
main source of information and main platform of communication. The pandemic has also impacted many businesses, 
including the event industry, such as wedding organizer (WO), which relied a lot on face-to-face or direct interaction 
to run its business. Since the pandemic began, these businesses have had to catch up with shifting its marketing 
communication strategy through the social media. This study chose five notable Wedding Organizers in Malang as 
the informants to look more into the strategy. The quantitative approach with a descriptive paradigm was implemented 
to be able to find out how those wedding organizers took its marketing communication strategy using social media to 
approach and attract its consumers. All five organizers have been using Instagram as the main platforms to connect 
with their audience and WhatsApp to communicate with their team. Optimizing the social media features to share 
visual documentations of events, choosing the perfect moments to evoke emotions and have the right aesthetic, as well 
as knowing the right message through captions and hashtag are among the strategies applied to stay afloat in the 
current time. Further research could analyze the challenges in implementing marketing communication strategy post-
pandemic, and also develop integrated marketing communication model related to social media optimization.

1.Introduction 
During this pandemic, businesses and industries were affected and had to fight to maintain their sustainability. The 
workforce is also affected because millions of workers have lost their job. Meanwhile, employees have to adapt to a 
new working system work from home (WFH) and rely more on technology. Based on the data from the Central 
Statistics Agency (2020), the most affected sectors of business besides hospitality as well as transportation and 
warehousing is the entertainment or service sector. 
 
As a business in the service sector, wedding organizer organizations are among the most affected by the Covid-19 
pandemic. Various restrictions due to the pandemic made, WO experienced a reduction to the cancellation of the 
wedding party. The ban on crowding, health protocol policies that require the application of social distancing, physical 
distancing, restrictions on activity hours and so on certainly have a significant impact on the type of wedding organizer 
service business. 
 
CEO & Founder of Event and Wedding Organizer, Ethel Riadi said the hardest conditions occurred during the early 
days of the pandemic. The decline was said to be drastic enough to squirm again when restrictions were loosened. 
From March to PSBB transition in July that August, newlyweds can issue another date, said Ethel in instagram 
Katadata live themed Wedding Party in Pandemic Period, (Lombok post 2020). During this time, Ethel said, the

1595","Indonesia Digital Landscape 2021 by WeAreSocial & Hootsuite (Kemp  2021) shows that in January 2021, Instagram 
users in Indonesia accounted for almost 42%  (Figure 9) of internet users overall. It cannot be denied that Instagram 
platform is a social media that provides higher interaction results. This is also supported by Rival IQ data (2021) 
related to high engagement levels on Instagram even with low post rates. In addition, new Instagram features like 
IGTV and Reels are also important for engagement between businesses and customers. This is also supported by the 
response from informants who use Instagram as the main social media for their business. 
 
According to the results by Virtanen et al. (2017), the use of social media will give good results if the business is 
actively engaging with customers. Instagram is also a medium with great potential for businesspeople. Especially in 
times of pandemics that cause crises in various industries, including businesses in the event management area, it is 
important to optimize strategies and content on social media. 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Most used Communication Medium 
 
During pandemic, digital communication becomes increasingly vital to ensure performance of business and also to 
optimize the teamwork within organization (Figure 10). For the five respondents, WhatsApp became the main medium 
for communicating within their teams. Other media also used are Facebook, Zoom, Google Meet. Regarding to the 
restrictions applied during this pandemic, the frequency of direct meetings becomes greatly reduced. This causes 
businesses, including WO to take advantage of online meeting platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet. The use of 
such platforms depends on the needs of each organizer, especially to maintain communication and coordination within 
the team. For example, Zoom and Google Meet are used for team and client coordination meetings, WhatsApp is used 
for personal or group communication. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
5.1 Conclusions 
Pandemic has become a challenge for The Wedding Organizers to maintain its business. Among the impacts is how it 
communicates to its stakeholders and runs its business. Thus, there are several strategies that have been done to deal 
with this situation as it follows: 
 
1. 
Maximizing social media function especially publishing photos and videos and all the documented events. 
2. 
Selecting moment of events that have been documented for publishing to represent feeling and emotions 
through videos and photos, as well as exhibiting the aesthetics or visual quality of the photos and videos 
3. 
Choosing the right message through the appropriate captions and relevant hashtag, not only to improve the 
reach of customers, but can also be used to signify its brand characteristic as a WO. 
4. 
Maintaining posting frequency in accordance with the number of events and the expected number of target 
audience to be reached, aside from for consistency purpose. 
 
5.2 Recommendations 
1. 
Further research could analyze the challenges of implementing marketing communication strategy in social 
media for the wedding organizer post pandemic

Abstract 
 
Systems for refining and handling foundries have rapidly evolved in recent years. There is a constant requirement that 
the foundry industrial maintain its competitive stature in such a competitive environment. Absence of proper 
productivity measures diminishes the ability to ensure production performance. Uncontrollable and unstable processes 
impact profitability and sustainability of the organisation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current 
production capability with a view of enhancement. A combination of descriptive and non-parametric statistic was used 
to analyse data gathered. The proposed industrial engineering methodologies of improvement proved successful for 
the foundry industry. A quantitative cross-sectional survey research design was used for the study. This study utilised 
a self-developed questionnaire to identify the factors that are contributing to the low productivity of the Gauteng 
foundry industry. The population for this study consisted of foundry employees in the Gauteng Province of South 
Africa. The study selected a purposive sampling technique to provide insight into the specific study. The quantitative 
data obtained from the study was analysed using several statistical tools in the Statistical Package for the Social 
Science (SPSS) version 24.0 tool. The study was restricted to the Foundry industry, Gauteng Province. The integration 
of Lean methods, Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle method, and 5S methodology is proposed to achieve continuous 
improvement in the production environment of the foundry industry. This framework provides guidance on the use of 
productivity improvement techniques by clearly indicating steps and targets that support the achievement of cost 
reduction and continuous process improvement.

1. Introduction 
The foundry manufacturing processes include metal castings that are equipped for making moulds, melting and 
handling molten metal, performing the casting process, and cleaning the finished casting. Metal castings include a 
large and diverse family of processes that can be categorised in many ways. For example, molten metal is cast into 
shapes using moulds and various patterns. Metal casting refers to the process through which the molten metal is 
allowed to flow by gravity or under pressure into a mould, where it solidifies in the shape of the mould cavity. The 
metal casting is removed from the mould after which it is machined and heat-treated. According to Cagno, Ramirez-

1605",,"The proposed framework addressed five key factors that the foundry management and leadership should implement. 
These are listed as follows: 
4. 
 
5.5 Training of workers in productivity improvement skills 
The labor force is the backbone of the success of any productivity improvement framework, and skills development 
is central to improving productivity. Based on the outcome of the study, 41% of the respondents have only matric or 
lower than matric qualification, with only 22% having some form of apprenticeship training. The proposed framework 
addresses this challenge by enforcing productivity improvement training to improve the skills and productivity of the 
foundry employees. This can be done by implementing an effective skills development system that focuses on 
technical training, technology advancement training, and industry-related skills training. This can help the Gauteng 
foundry sector to sustain productivity growth and translate that into more and better jobs. The proposed framework 
also enforces and encourages the coordination of skills development with the adoption of new technologies; this is 
done to improve the foundry sector’s global competitiveness.  
 
The proposed framework will ensure that the investment in human capital can increase the number of skilled workers. 
On the other hand, increasing new technology will require appropriately trained workers and managers in order to 
sustain local job growth and productivity. Productivity improvement can only be achieved when all affected parties 
take ownership and become leaders of the adopted strategy. This is a team effort that involves all employees in the 
foundry. The proposed framework encourages workers to be part of the focus of productivity improvement in the 
foundry. It enforces taking ownership and leadership of the product strategy and the actual implementation. Just less 
than 20% of the employees disagreed with the suggestion that foundry workers must be encouraged to lead 
productivity improvement initiatives.

5. Conclusion 
The proposed troubleshooting tool based on fuzzy expert system can diagnose the possible fault of deodoriser failure 
and provide recommendations for necessary action. The possible fault is extracted by interviewing experienced plant 
workers/operators in a palm oil deodoriser unit and analysed based on themes afterwards. The fuzzy logic applied in 
troubleshooting tool can deal data vagueness and mapping the possible fault to its necessary action(s). The sequence 
of necessary actions with linguistic phrases help plant workers in troubleshooting as well as in field training purposes.  
For the future work, the tool considers the different vegetable oil and integrated pre-treatment process in other 
refineries to generalise deodoriser troubleshooting techniques. In other words, the generalised deodoriser-
troubleshooting methodology will be applicable in other types of vegetable oil refineries.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this research is to know the master production schedule, Bill of Materials (BOM), and lot sizing 
techniques for Balado seasoning products at PT. XYZ The research method used is a quantitative method with the 
type of descriptive research, where research is done by collecting, preparing, and analyzing data to get a clear picture 
of the problem under study. Data collection is done through interviews and secondary data based on data provided by 
the company. Data analysis method uses the MRP (Material Requirement Planning) method, and in the MRP system, 
there are three techniques in determining the lot size or commonly called the Lot Sizing technique namely Lot for Lot, 
EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) and POQ (Order Quantity Period). Based on the calculation of Lot sizing it can be 
concluded that the lot-sizing technique for Component G, Component H and Component K that produces the optimal 
lot size is the Period Order Quantity (POQ) technique. While for other components that produce the optimal lot size 
is the Lot For Lot technique.

1. Introduction 
The increasingly fierce competition in the Manufacturing Industry requires companies to be more competitive so that 
they can win the existing market. Demand that is sometimes very uncertain is one of the causes of competition in the 
Manufacturing Industry to become increasingly fierce. This condition encourages companies to compete in meeting 
customer needs and providing services to customers. Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency (Badan Pusat 
Statistik Indonesia 2018), the growth of large and medium manufacturing industries can be seen in Figure 1.

4. Conclusion 
Based on the calculation at the forecasting stage, the forecasting results obtained 4,000 kg Balado Seasoning with 
the range of production time is 1000 kg every week. Then, from the calculation results at the explosion stage, the raw 
material needed to produce 4,000 kg of Balado seasoning is required 200 kg of raw materials A, 20,000 kg raw material

K and 8,000 kg raw material L. 
 
The total cost of Balado Seasoning raw material inventory for components G, H, and K is IDR 490,000 while for other 
components is IDR 500,000. Based on the calculation of the MRP method, techniques suitable for controlling raw 
materials G, H, and K are the Period Order Quantity (POQ) techniques. This technique is suitable because it has a 
smaller total inventory cost than Lot For Lot (LFL) and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). Then, for controlling other 
raw materials, the Lot For Lot (LFL) technique can be used because it has a total inventory cost that is smaller than 
the Period Order Quantity (POQ) and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ).

Abstract 
 
Various advanced technology products that can facilitate human life cause disruption, which has led to an increase in 
environmental pollution due to the rise in electronic waste. The management process and public knowledge about 
electronic waste management is still significant issue in electronic waste management. This provider of electronic 
waste collection facilities and information is needed. One of the existing electronic waste collection facilities is a 
government website, while application-based waste collection facilities still focus on plastic and other household 
waste. In addition, there are several complaints in operating the application-based electronic waste collection facility. 
One of the biggest problems is the interface design of this application, so this study will discuss the interface design 
of the electronic waste collection application. This study uses a design thinking approach to the solutions to the 
resulting problems can be oriented to customer needs. By using in-depth interview methods, empathy map tools, 
personas, kansei engineering, prototype, and several tools in usability testing, researchers will design 
recommendations that suit the needs of its users.

1. Introduction  
Various products of advanced technology that can facilitate human life cause disruption which has led to an increase 
in environmental pollution (Khan  et al.  2012). The increasing use of technology for economic growth is increasing 
rapidly in developing and poor countries, causing the amount of electronic waste (e-waste) which is globally estimated 
to have reached 65.4 million tons in 2017 (Yoshida  et al.  2015). 
 
There are 3 reasons why e-waste is an environmental issue, namely; (1) rapid growth in the amount of e-waste, globally 
at 4 percent/year (Ardi & Leisten  2016; Sumasto  et al.  2019); (2) the content of hazardous and toxic materials such 
as heavy metals (lead, cadmium and mercury) in e-waste (Yoshida et al.  2015); (3) the nature of e-waste that has 
economic value, because it contains materials such as recyclable materials. (Krol  et al.  2016). In some countries, e-
waste management can be divided into two major groups. In the first group, the informal sector with human labor is 
still used in the collection of segregated waste to carry out work such as (1) sorting, weighing, and moving materials; 
(2) Loading and unloading plastic, glass, or metal containers; (3) Identification, transfer, storage and dismantling of 
e-waste (Popa et al.  2017). The relationship between technology and the environment is very crucial and 
multidimensional. Interaction between humans and computers or commonly called human-computer interaction (HCI) 
is a science that discusses communication and interaction between users and systems.. The mobile application is 
developed for end-users who are intended to use it to dispose of their household electronic waste (e-waste) (kai Kang 
dean  2019). In the digital era where there are many applications to facilitate the distribution of waste in the form of 
applications, the UI display of this application is more focused on plastic waste and other household waste but has not

1636","The third component is an error with data collection carried out from the number of errors made by the respondent 
when given a task that must be completed. This error is meant in the form of activities outside the scenario provisions 
to complete a predetermined task. From the three personas, the aesthetic concept tends to have fewer errors than the 
Calm Concept (Figure 8).  
 
 
 
Figure 8. Error Graph Personas 1-3 
 
Taking the PSSUQ survey through a questionnaire on personas 1, personas 2, and personas 3. This data processing 
uses the average value of overall satisfaction and the three subscales for each persona. Then the PSSUQ survey 
analysis will explain the results of usability testing to see the satisfaction of each persona. The results of the PSSUQ 
survey consist of 16 questions with a 7-point Likert scale with the following range 1-7 with 1 category very agree and 
7 disagree. Based on the PSSUQ survey, it can be seen that the average value of system use, information quality, 
interface quality, and overall satisfaction is lower than the PSSUQ Norms value so the respondent's satisfaction score 
is in the satisfactory category. Of the two concepts, the value of system use, information quality, interface quality, and 
overall satisfaction tends to be a better aesthetic concept than the calm concept (Figure 9).

6. Conclusion  
The Design Thinking method is used to place the user as an objective respondent for the development of a user 
interface design for a waste collection application that meets user needs. Based on these results, the following 
conclusions can be drawn: 
 
a. 
The Design Thinking methodology allows us to develop user interface prototypes for e-waste collection 
applications. User interface prototype design for electronic waste collection there are 2 concept designs according 
to data analysis from respondents. 
b. The results of the testing process for both designs used performance metrics and the PSSUQ survey to measure 
the effectiveness and satisfaction of the designs that had been made. Based on the results of the performance 
metrics test on the aesthetic concept design and the calm concept of the three personas, it can be seen that the 
aesthetic concept design is more appropriate than the calm concept seen from the time on task and error values 
and the PSSUQ survey. Therefore, it can be concluded that the right design for the three personas is the aesthetic 
concept design. 
 
The limitation of the research that is the focus of this research is to develop a prototype interface design for electronic 
waste collection applications so that for further research it is necessary to carry out further research related to analysis 
related to usability tests from the prototype design concept of electronic waste collection.

Abstract  
 
Integrating production planning and preventive maintenance (PM) scheduling is one of the most studied problems 
related to operations management. In fact, both decisions are highly interrelated. An efficient integration leads to cost 
optimization and high delivery reliability. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of the stochastic dependence on the 
integrated preventive maintenance scheduling and production planning. For this purpose, Cox Proportional Hazards 
Model (CPHM), based on the exponential survival distribution and an integer programming model are used. The 
results show that increasing the degree of dependence affects both production and maintenance costs and the system’s 
available production capacity.

1647","In figure 3, we can notice the impact of 𝛽𝛽 on the available production capacity for different value of 𝜆𝜆.  Firstly, we 
observe that this figure supports the observations made in Figures 1 and 2. Secondly, we lost more available production 
capacity in function of 𝛽𝛽 in systems with a higher failure rate, which means that the resistance to this effect is directly 
linked to the frequency of PM periods.  
 
 
Figure 3. Impact of β on the available production capacity with the variation of λ 
 
Based on the previous analysis, we highlight the following observations: (i) The available production capacity of 
system and costs are impacted significantly by the stochastic dependence; (ii) No considering the stochastic 
dependence effect during production planning and maintenance schedule causes excepted consequences and additional 
costs; (iii) The stochastic dependence has more impact on components that have a high probability of failure. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this paper, we have evaluated the stochastic dependence effect on the integration of production planning and 
maintenance schedule for a parallel two-machine system. We proposed a new approach based on CPHM to incorporate 
the stochastic dependence on an integer linear program to determine the optimal production plan with preventive 
replacement. The results showed that the stochastic dependence effect significantly influences the production plans, 
maintenance policies, and costs. Hence, it is recommended to use such an approach as a starting point, to obtain a 
more realistic planning, because not considering the stochastic dependence effect during the planning of these two 
activities causes excepted consequences and additional costs.

Abstract 
In today's world, the importance of environmental conservation is a huge factor that any industry needs to 
consider this fact to be a green company. HVAC systems generally consume around 20 percent of the total energy 
required in any building. That chiller is a critical component of an HVAC system; we need to make sure that it 
works efficiently. If we can improve the efficiency with which our chillers work, we can reduce the power 
consumption and save a lot of money. Often, people are not fully aware of all the factors causing the low performance 
of the chiller, and they miss a few factors. This paper highlights how to increase the chiller’s performance without 
replacing it. This paper will help you identify such problems whenever they occur in the chiller. A detailed 
description of all the possible issues, along with the specific cause of each situation, is mentioned in the paper. 
Once we know the reason, we can quickly brainstorm the idea and find loopholes in our existing system. 
Moreover, the practical ways that we need to take to eliminate these problems are also mentioned. All the 
techniques and methods suggested in the paper can be applied to existing chillers. By successfully implementing 
these solutions, many organizations have increased the efficiency of their chillers and reduced their power 
consumption.

Abstract 
Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning continuous improvement. It is a philosophy widely adopted by Japanese 
manufacturing company. However, due to globalization leading to increase in competition among small and medium 
scale enterprises (SMEs), especially in India. It is pivotal for this organization to provide High quality products at a 
reasonable price in order for them to survive. Kaizen is lean manufacturing tool used to improvise the overall process 
of company which ultimately leads to reduction in production cost. Moreover, process efficiency gets improves 
through implementation of few tools out of many tools lying under the umbrella of kaizen which are Total quality 
control (TQC), Total productive maintenance (TPM), Quality improvement, Automation, zero defect (ZD), Kanban, 
Just-in-time (JIT), Quality control system (QCC) and Suggestion system. In this study, Kaizen system was executed 
though 5S in assembly, machine and mold shop department, Kanban system for Fasteners, Plotting Value stream 
Mapping (VSM) in machine shop of a critical product, obtaining the process Capability ratio for Gun drill machine 
and other small improvements 
 
Keywords  
Total quality control, Value stream mapping, Kanban. 
 
1. Introduction and Significance of study 
The study was conducted at a German MNC involved in production of rubber and silicon injection molding machines. 
They had engineer-to-order business strategy where they modify the size of FIFO, clamping force, and mold design 
as per customer requirement. The company is situated at Gujarat India. Here in this study, company’s name is given 
ABC for reference. Since few years, company implemented lean practices like 5S, TQM, OEE, VSM etc. However, 
none of the practices were used for identifying non-value-added activist use of above lean principles were solely for 
purpose of achieving ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.Therfore, decision was taken to implement kaizen in some of the 
pivotal departments. 5S was implemented in Assembly, machine shop and Mold department, Statistical process 
control (SPC) was implemented in quality control, redesigning of masking plates in paint shop. The above small 
improvement helped not only to reduce non-value-added activities but also created awareness among employees 
regarding benefits and importance of lean tools. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Kaizen is a philosophy for small continuous efforts resulting into enhancement of productivity and efficiency of 
company through waste identification and elimination. Moreover, some of the intangible benefits of kaizen 
implementation are increase in employee’s motivation and morale because it requires involvement of all employees 
(Rewers et al. 2015). To achieve this goals Value stream mapping (VSM)is applied in manufacturing organizations 
(Rohac and Januska  2015),(Kuhlang et al. 2013), (Tabassum and Khan 2016), quality assurance (Haefner et al. 2014) 
process companies (Zahoor et al. 2016) and maintenance departments.(kasava et al.2015). moreover, provided an 
insight on VSM through an analogy by comparing company as a ship and non-value-added activities as icebergs. 
While a very small portion of ice is visible above water and most of the portion of iceberg is hidden under the water 
(Dadashnejad and valmohammadi 2017). Similarly, via VSM company can perform top-down and bottom-up survey 
of process which leads to identification of all hidden non-value-added activities. (Haefner et al. 2014) used VSM for 
solving quality issues, they advised use of VSM for activities like visualization, analysis and quality assurance 
design.[Tabassum and Khan 2016), presented Case in automotive manufacturing unit where they used 5S 
methodology and VSM .VSM helped them to identify the bottleneck operations associated with assembly line and

1657","5. Result and discussions 
There were many intangible benefits of 5S implementation like Improvements in working conditions , perfect 
allocations of essential tools leading to decrease in tool searching time , Dedicated pellets  for work-in-process 
resulting into decrease in  percentage space utilization , reduction in human motions and transportation of good , 
decrement in non-value added activity, improvement in coordination and team work among employee. The above 
benefits were identified based on personal interview with shop floor workers. Moreover, Due to established SOPs, 
there was no discrepancy form worker to worker in using cleaning medium, sequence in which to assemble injection 
moulding machine. Furthermore, VSM of cavity block gave an overall survey on all the machining process and 
auxiliary process used to prepare cavity blocks. Based on which optimum operation sequencing was proposed, which 
can reduce  machine idle time form 88 hours to 70.65 hours , reduction in machining time  by 8.72% and increase in 
process efficiency by 4.19 %.Thus, cumulatively excluding  outside post machining time lead time can be reduced 
from 16.79 days to 13.68 days. Furthermore, there were few observations going out of U.C.L and L.C.L lines. These 
variations were less than 0.02 mm out of control limit which is of less concern .Also, R-chart had some points going 
beyond control lines but more points are below L.C.L lines and no points are above U.C.L line. Thus, process is not 
out of control for machining holes. As the process was in control showing natural cause of variation, process capability 
index was calculated and it was found Cp value to be greater than CpkValue indicating process is in control. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper, case study is presented with an objective o discussing effect of kaizen implementation in an injection 
moulding machine. Emphasis was made on identifying and reducing waste, proper arrangement of tools, 
standardization of certain process. Kaizen is not a new terminology in this highly competitive marketplace. It means 
quest for consistently identifying problems and solving problems. The kaizen principles involve improving process 
and employee’s performance with low investment. For a company to grow kaizen and Innovation both gets necessary. 
Innovation involves creating something new with requirement for huge amount of investment. Whereas; the kaizen is 
continuous improvement in existing system with requirement of very less capital. There, is no earth-shattering 
inventions required for implementing kaizen, all which is need is common sense and proper understanding of process

Abstract  
 
Texture analysis and evaluation would help in predicting a component’s functionality. An attempt has been made in 
the current research work to explore the texture properties of machined surfaces in detail. Pieces made from milling, 
shaping, grinding, EDM, and sandblasting processes are used for texture analysis. The method uses a charge-coupled 
device (CCD) camera connected to the vision system to acquire images for texture analysis.  The experimental 
investigation revealed that texture features extracted from the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) help study 
texture features. The experimental investigation revealed that when distance =1, the classification accuracy was less. 
However, the classification accuracy improved when distance =2, but a further increase in the distance would not 
significantly improve the classification accuracy. Instead, it would add up to the computational time. Thus, it was 
concluded that d=2 gave maximum classification accuracy of 96%. 
 
Keywords: Surface Texture, Surface Roughness, Waviness, Form Error, Milled Texture. 
 
1. Introduction 
Engineering components are made from various primary and secondary manufacturing processes. Primary processes 
include casting, forging, rolling, extrusion, etc. Machining is an example of a secondary manufacturing process. Every 
manufacturing process would produce a unique texture. Thus, the texture created from the milling process would differ 
from that made from a grinding process. Different engineering applications demand different types of surface textures. 
The texture of a machined surface would consist of surface irregularities having a shorter wavelength known as 
‘roughness,’ a medium wavelength known as ‘waviness,’ and a large wavelength known as ‘form error.’ Every 
engineering application requires specifying both roughness and texture. Thus, in a component’s drawing, mention 
would be made of roughness and texture. And the measurement of both surface and roughness would be crucial in any 
component inspection. Also, these measurements would help predict the success of the component when it is put into 
service. This clearly shows the significance of measuring both the roughness and texture. Many researchers have 
contributed methods and techniques for assessing both roughness and texture. The most popular method for measuring 
roughness is by contact measurement method. The contact method would be using a diamond stylus to traverse the 
surface, which would give accurate results. However, they are slow and can be used in post-process inspection of 
surfaces. To overcome these limitations, non-contact methods using electro-optical techniques came into being. These 
methods also give accurate readings, but the plans are not widely used in industries. They are mostly restricted to 
laboratory environments. Also, the technique is susceptible and cannot be used in industrial environments. An attempt 
has been made in the current research work to study the tribological properties of different machined surfaces utilizing 
a vision system. 
 
2. Literature review 
Many researchers have been working in the area of texture classification. One of the earliest works on Texture reported 
was by Julesz (1973).  One of the characteristics of image textures is the spatial distribution of grey levels. He used 
both first-order and second-order statistics to define the image texture. First-order statistics can be computed from the 
image histograms. He concluded that their second-order statistics could not be identical to discriminate between the 
two images.  These approaches may extract texture features directly from images or sometimes in the spatial frequency

The classification experiment was performed using six types of specimens. The images were classed into training sets 
and test sets. Each training set and test set had 150 images. Initially, the software was trained using 150 images, as 
shown in Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10, respectively.  Once the software is trained, the images from the test sets are 
used for classification. Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10 respectively show the classification accuracies of the software 
for various specimens. What is evident from the above experiment is that classification accuracy got improved when 
the distance increased from d= 1 to d=2. However, when the distance is increased from d=2 to d=3, an increase in the 
classification accuracy is not significant. Thus d=2 would give the best classification accuracy. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The current research has made an effort to perform texture analysis of machined and 3d printed surfaces. GLCM 
technique was used for extracting various textures. It was revealed from the experiment the texture values would 
depend on the distance and angle metrics used while computing the grey level co-occurrence matrix. The experimental 
investigation revealed that when distance =1, the classification accuracy was less. However, the classification accuracy 
improved when distance =2, but a further increase in the distance would not significantly improve the classification 
accuracy. Instead it would add up to the computational time. Thus, it was concluded that d=2 gave maximum 
classification accuracy of 96%.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to see how Bitcoin as a Cryptocurrency can affect China's Political Economy Policy. By using Susan 
Strange's Theory of Finance structure, this research will focus on strategy and how the Chinese government takes 
policy on Bitcoin's existence. This study uses secondary data obtained from news, reports, and previous studies, which 
are then analyzed using the Variable Operational or Measurement method, namely the attributes or properties of 
objects or activities that have certain variations set by the researcher to be studied and then draw conclusions. This 
study shows that Bitcoin with all its Cost and Benefit can disrupt the national economic politics of China so that China 
takes steps to illegally use Bitcoin as a Payment Instrument and mining Bitcoin.

1. Introduction  
People has been using currency over the years. In the past, currency was minted directly from precious metals such as 
gold and silver. Then, The introduction of paper money and the face value of cash was separated from its face value, 
but the currency is still backed by gold deposits. (Vranken 2017) In the last decade, The increase in Information 
Technology due to globalization. The development of information technology will relate to all fields including the 
financial sector (Noorsanti et al.  2018) Cryptocurrency or often called virtual/digital currency is the result of a 
development of financial technology. Bitcoin has been released since 2008 and started growing in 2011 all over the 
world. In its development, bitcoin has the concept of P2P (Peer to Peer) or decentralized between server users in an 
internet network. Bitcoin is growing fast because of the efficiency that makes people use Bitcoin. (Warmke  2020) 
However, Bitcoin legal status currently in many European countries such as Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, 
Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland or Turkey. This type of currency has been used that many 
coffee shops and restaurants provide bitcoin addresses making it possible to make transactions using Bitcoin (Maftei  
2014) 
Different from banking systems or commodity exchanges, Bitcoin transactions do not involve intermediaries who 
record and verify all transactions. All those Bitcoin transactions are verified via Blockchain. Mining Bitcoin is one of 
the ways to earn Bitcoin which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin mining is done by using 
special computer devices to solve algorithms or mathematical calculations of Bitcoin transactions made by miners.(Xu 
et al.  2021). One of the countries that use Bitcoin the most is China. Chinese society is a big country that makes 
Bitcoin transactions. The bitcoin exchange rate continues to increase due to demand from all over the world who 
continue to transact everyday. China is also one of the industries that has created the largest Bitcoin mining pool in 
the world due to growing users. (Qi  2021) The recent use of bitcoins has been a benefit for users but might bring up 
a problem for the government. Bitcoin does offer a lot of convenience and guaranteed privacy because this currency 
is not supervised by the state legality regulatory agency. Of course, several governments have taken steps to ban or 
prevent the use of Bitcoin. (Xie  2019)

1679","to China, Global mining requires high energy Computing Power, used to use large amounts of electricity, and therefore 
contribute significantly to global emissions. (Eyal & Sirer  2014) 
Concept of Realism Realism is a view of human nature and the international political system. Realism is a view of 
international politics which shows that in fact international relations are competitive and show more of a conflictual 
side (Wardhani  2015). Realists see the state as the main actor in international relations and global politics. realists 
argue that non-state actors, like Multinational Corporations and other International Organizations are not more 
important than countries. This Realist concept is used by China, China with the concept of the highest political power 
by a country is starting to worry, Bitcoin made quite complex problems in China, the Chinese Government Authorities 
cannot control its utilization and can interfere with Yuan as a legal instrument payment in China. to the international 
crime problem using Bitcoin and also the environmental problem caused by Bitcoin Mining. (Seetharaman et al.  
2017). China, which applied to a system of supreme power held by the State, considers Bitcoin not in the same 
direction with their vision and mission. Bitcoin is considered not in accordance with the principles of the country's 
economy and difficult to regulate, in addition to endangering the environment. Bitcoin stability cannot be regulated 
by country, According to China, the financial system must serve the real economy, an economy that has value and has 
form such as Gold or Paper Money, whereas Bitcoin is “Intangible”, according to China does not want to legalize the 
use of Bitcoin because it is driven by financial speculation. China thinks it can affect the financial stability of a country 
and threaten “Currency Sovereignty” they country. (Anisiuba et al.  2021) China's political policies which are the 
geopolitical foundation for expanding its territory make China sensitive to Bitcoin issue. China has prepared major 
changes to its economy. A high growth rate and an economy that continues to develop are the main attraction for the 
country or in several surrounding countries because it can advance the economy in their country. (Goodkind et al. 
2020).  
6. Conclusion 
The Researchers found reasons why Bitcoin can threaten the sovereignty of the country's currency, besides its 
circulation cannot be regulated by the state. the use of Bitcoin resulting from mining Bitcoin which drains a lot of 
energy and is not environmentally friendly. China saw cryptocurrencies as a high financial risk and as a way for 
citizens to avoid strict government controls over capital. With Susan Strange Theory help The Researcher to found 
many possible excuse how Bitcoin can Threat Currency Sovereignty of China (Akyildirim et al.  2021) 
 
The Researchers Analyze about the development of Bitcoin every year. in Susan Strange's Financial Structure 
Theory, Bitcoin can influence a country's economic policy. The massive development of bitcoin through a 
community that makes many people has interest to own this digital asset, The government is starting to worry about 
its development which cannot be controlled by the state resulting in security issues and inflation that the government 
cannot handle and made threat currency sovereignty of China (Brown  1999) 
 
This research is also very important because it contributes practically to the topic of Bitcoin in China and contributes 
to the development of research that will be researched in the future.

Abstract 
 
Public higher education in the United States (US) is funded through two primary forms: one is through state higher 
education appropriation funds, and the other is student financial aid that is directly given to students. Increasing 
postsecondary full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment and graduation rate are becoming a crucial economic priority in 
the US. However, only a limited study is available about whether state investment in higher education and increasing 
tuition charges can impact FTE student enrollment (FTEE) and graduation rate (GR) at 4-year public universities in 
the US. A systematic literature review was conducted for the present research to comprehend the literature gap and 
identify factors or variables that may affect FTEE and GR. Five independent variables (IVs): state higher education 
appropriations per FTE (SHEA), average undergraduate charges per FTE (AUGC), student tuition share as a 
percentage of per capita income (STSPCI), state higher education appropriations as a percentage of GDP (SHEAGDP), 
and state financial aid (SFA) per FTE were selected. The dependent variables (DVs) were full-time equivalent 
enrollment (FTEE) and graduation rate (GR) at 4-year US public higher education institutions. Historical US public 
higher education data for 50 years (each year as one dataset, n=50) between 1971 and 2020 were collected and 
analyzed. The multiple linear regression tool of the open-source data analytics and machine learning software was 
used to test the hypotheses if the independent variables were significantly related to the dependent variables. 
Hypothesis 1 was about FTEE, and hypothesis 2 was about GR. 
 
For FTEE, three variables were found to be significant: SHEA, AUGC, and SFA. For GR, two variables were found 
to be significant: SHEA and STSPCI. Hence, two data analytical models were developed involving the significant 
IVs: one for FTEE and the other for GR. Findings from the first model revealed that when state higher education 
appropriation (SHEA) funds increase, average undergraduate tuition charge (AUGC) decreases, and more student 
financial aid (SFA) is awarded, FTE enrollment (FTEE) increases. The second model results indicated that when state 
higher education appropriation (SHEA) funds increase and student tuition share as a percentage of per capita income 
(STSPCI) decreases, there is an increase in graduation rate (GR). These findings show how state budget cuts could 
impact students enrolling and graduating at public 4-year institutions in the US. State policymakers, higher education

Abstract  
This paper analyses the legality of subsidies for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, the mechanisms for how such 
measures and frameworks are applicable, and the urgencies on why this framework shall be applied. This paper consists 
of three main objectives. The first objective is to discuss the legality of subsidies for MSMEs according to the Subsidies 
and Countervailing Measures Agreement in Annex 1A WTO Agreement. The second objective discusses Indonesia’s 
Municipal Law which provides subsidies for MSMEs and how can the WTO Member States can learn to apply this 
measure. And the third objective seeks to explain the urgencies of this framework which are economic recovery from 
the Covid-19 Pandemic, and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. By applying the Utilitarianism Theory, 
and the Absolute Advantage Theory, the writer may understand that WTO Member States shall apply non-actionable 
subsidies to act according to the SCM Agreement, Furthermore, the writer may also understand that Indonesia’s Law 
herein may acquire its status as customary international law if it is persistently applied. Lastly, subsidies for MSMEs 
shall be applied by each WTO Member State to recover from the pandemic’s effect and in achieving SDGs.

1. Introduction  
Due to its development, international trade law has grown not only as an instrument in settling trade disputes between 
states but also as an instrument for states’ economic development. Since its emergence as one of the branches of 
international law, states have been conducting international trade due to economic reasons in a form of various natural 
resources causing states they specialize in goods production and political reasons in the form of national security and 
national industries protection (Subedi  2012). In explaining the purposes of international trade, Aprita and Adhitya 
(2020) expressed that international trade has several purposes. These purposes consist of inter alia increasing the 
world’s trade volume, establishing trade in favor of the state’s economic development, increasing living standards, and 
providing opportunities for decent work (Aprita and Adhitya  2020). 
 
As part of the public international law jurisprudence (Adolf, 2014), the writer opined that a state can only be bound to 
an international trade law regime base on its consent. This premise is compatible with the notion of states’ common 
will (Vereinbarungstheorie) expressed by Triepel. In explaining this doctrine, Triepel addressed that international law 
will only have its binding effect as long as states have consented to be bound by that international law norm (Diantha 
and Putra  2017). It is indeed can be understood that this theory has relevance in the practice of international trade law 
because the World Trade Organization (WTO), as an international organization concerning international trade has been 
established under the common will of states in achieving free trade.

Abstract 
 
The use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a photovoltaic cell could have significant extrapolations on the commercial 
solar cell market. Two interrelated directions within CNT’s research area are crucial to the ultimate success of the 
following endeavor accordingly: 1) structural engineering of CNTs (Separation, purification, and enrichment; 2) CNTs 
integration and a hole selective contact into solar cells as a photosensitive element. All these topics have experienced 
tremendous growth over past the 20 years. CNTs are an ideal two-dimensional material formed of sp2-hybridized 
carbon due to their unique physical, thermal, and optical properties. The high robustness and high transparency of 
CNTs in the broad wavelength region make them a very attractive material for many components that are used in solar 
cells. Conventional solar cell efficiency is less than 30%. The goal of this work is to improve the efficiency of the 
solar cell by over 80% by applying the chirality engineering of the CNTs with a purification rate of above 98%. 
Therefore, this research is proposed the different structures of CNTs (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) have different radii 
and chirality to improve the efficiency of the solar cell. This proposed work will start by developing a mathematical 
model and verifying the results by using CAD Tools like COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB. The model will help 
to harvest the energy near to infrared that will be a milestone in the renewable energy sector by introducing the CNT-
based solar cells having an efficiency of 80 % from the research lab to the end-user technology.

Abstract  
 
This study investigates the relationship between the influence of behavior and organizational culture on the adoption 
of electronic commerce in businesses. E-commerce adoption refers to using company websites to deliver information, 
establish relationships, and execute transactions using electronic networks instead of traditional methods. In the face 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, a company's ability to run its operations depends on its ability to leverage existing 
technologies. As a result, this study aims to determine how organizational behavior and culture influence the adoption 
of e-commerce in Indonesian SMEs. This research was carried out in 2021, and the scope of the study covered 115 
SMEs spread across Indonesia. The quantitative research method employed includes descriptive and inferential 
statistical data analysis tools, such as regression analysis, to answer the research questions. Following the findings of 
this study, it is clear that the influence of behavior and organizational culture impact the adoption of electronic 
commerce. Confirms that behavior and organizational culture affect the adoption of electronic commerce. Companies 
must pay particular attention to the influence of behavior and organizational culture on the adoption of electronic 
commerce

Abstract  
 
With more women entering the workforce and the increasing trend of dual career couples, the paper examines the 
movement in the Indian context concerning its effect on organizations and vice versa. In this study, we empirically try 
to observe if the spouse's employment status affects the engagement with the employee and if there is a difference 
between the dual-career and single career couples concerning organizational policies. Through this paper, in light of 
this trend of both husband and wife being employed, we try to understand if the family-supportive work environment 
impacts the employees' engagement levels. Consequently, do the organizations now need to take cognizance of the 
phenomena and initiate practical implications to win this respect? 
 
Keywords 
Organization Implications, Dual Career couple, working couple. 
 
1. Introduction  
The study attempts to analyze the trend of the increase in the dual-career couple and its influence on the work and 
organizations. This paper is set in the Indian context, chosen because the trend is relatively new to the country, and 
sparse work is done in this area. This Indian context makes the study interesting since it brings a complex interplay 
of the role of males and females. It also subtly touches on the issue of the duality of roles that Indian women are 
caught in because of the existing values and norms and the newfound independence of employment that they have 
found (Ramu  1989). This paper becomes essential to the Indian context for the organizations since they can gauge if 
it’s about time to take cognizance of this phenomenon or if not now, it is inevitable shortly. The boom in 
opportunities in employment has come as a mixed blessing for the Indian ‘dual career couple’ who is caught 
between the dilemmas of their occupational pursuits conflicting with their domestic roles. With both men and 
women working in a marriage, there have been shifts in the traditional roles and responsibilities shared between men 
and women in Indian society. The accountabilities of household chores, child-care, and taking care of elderly parents 
have now been divided between husband and wife. We try to study if it means any implication for the organization

1709","6. Conclusion  
Though the results of the differences between the dual career and single career couple might not be very significant 
in this study, this needs to be validated by another study. Organizations need to take cognizance of this phenomenon 
in the immediate present and the future. This trend of both partners would only increase in the Indian context. The 
Indian organizations should look at the West to draw parallels to the situations that may arise in years to come and 
be future-ready to cater to the needs of this group which would be a significant population of the organizations in a 
few years.

Abstract  
This paper investigates the role of internal networks on long-term borrowing in large business groups. In 
line with the network-assisted resource-based hypothesis, our findings suggest that firms associated with 
big business groups tend to use their internal networks for raising long-term borrowings. These findings 
indicate that an association with a business group increases the ease of access to debt capital within their 
internal networks.

1. Introduction  
In their initial study, Berle and Means (1932), Jensen and Meckling (1976) opined that in a firm's structure, a gap 
exists between ownership and control, and managers do not always prioritize the maximization of the shareholders' 
wealth, instead, waste resources for self-benefit. Jensen (1986), in his study, suggested that debt attenuates conflict 
between managers and shareholders in companies with higher free cash flows. Pinegar and Wilbricht (1989) found 
that the principal-agent problem can be resolved by capital structure and, more specifically, by increasing debt. 
Similarly, Lubatkin and Chatterjee (1994) and Boodhoo (2009) reported that an increased debt-to-equity ratio allows 
the company to ensure the managers' efficiency; with excessive debt, creditors dominate in the decision-making 
process of the firm, which may lead to conflicts between shareholders and creditors due to difference in ideologies. 
Creditors lookout for debt payments, while shareholders seek dividend distribution. The conflict between 
shareholders, managers, and creditors leads us to study the relationship between corporate governance and capital 
structure. Studies opine that those financial decisions, such as dividend policy, can be mitigated by leverage as 
dividend policy and governance are substitutes for reducing agency costs; firms with weak CG need to establish a 
reputation by paying more dividends.  
In addition, we can speculate that firms with better quality governance will borrow more because the risk could be 
perceived as low for lenders. Optimization of capital structure and decisions related to the firm's financial resources 
significantly affect a firm's economic activities and commercial relationships. Financial managers combine a

Table 4 provides the OLS regression results. It can be seen that the coefficient of our variable of interest is positive 
and significant, suggesting that a firm affiliated with the top 50 business groups has a significantly higher borrowing 
from the promotor, directors, and shareholders compared to firms that are not affiliated with the top 50 business 
groups. As expected, the coefficient of the firm's size is also positive and significant, suggesting that the larger the 
firm size higher the long-term debt raised by promotors, directors, and shareholders.

5. Conclusion  
Our results show that firms belonging to big business groups raise higher long-term debt from promotors, directors, 
and shareholders. These results support the hypothesis that firms affiliated with big business groups use their 
internal-network sources of capital to raise long-term debt from promotors, directors, and shareholders.

Abstract 
This study analyzes strengthening participatory supervision through the Online Participatory Supervisory Cadre 
School during simultaneous regional elections in West Kalimantan in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
General Elections Supervisory Body (Bawaslu) is the body responsible for organizing and supervising elections. 
Bawaslu has a mission to create community-based participatory control. With this mission, Bawaslu initiated the 
Participatory Supervisory Cadre School, a joint movement between Bawaslu and the community to create an 
election process with integrity. The Online Participatory Supervisory Cadre School aims to increase knowledge and 
practical skills regarding supervision for election supervisors and observers as well as share knowledge and skills 
regarding youth participation, especially online during a pandemic. The establishment of this school received a 
positive response from the community, the high enthusiasm of young people in registering was a good first step for 
Bawaslu to create community-based participatory control as a supervisor for elections and regional elections in the 
future.

1. Introduction 
Digital democracy changes the pattern and form of conventional or face-to-face supervision and training into mass 
meetings in virtual spaces in an online form (Hague & Loader, 1999). The Covid-19 pandemic brought significant 
changes to the regional head election process stages, especially in West Kalimantan. The Election Law no. 7 of 2017 
is to realize fair and integrity elections. One of the formal institutions tasked with creating fair elections with 
integrity is Bawaslu. Elections will not run effectively and efficiently without the cooperation and participation of 
the community, either institutionally or individually. It is an effort made by Bawaslu to create fair elections with 
integrity during a pandemic. 
 
Bawaslu established a supervising cadre school to realize elections with integrity and become a media for election 
education for people with integrity (Saufi et al., 2020). Democracy allows citizens to get references to participate in 
determining public policies through the availability of quality information with education (Fishkin, 2011). The 
embodiment of cadres as a driving group in the 2020 simultaneous regional elections can create discussion and

1. Introduction  
PT Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk, is one of regulator companies on toll roads in Indonesia. It has implemented payment 
transactions to be 100% non-cash vis-à-vis an e-toll card, as one of the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) tools. The 
implementation of non-cash transactions is one of supporting policies toward Bank Indonesia's program, namely the 
National Non-Cash Movement, known as Gerakan Nasional Non Tunai (GNNT). This policy has the objectives 
encouraging people to increase the use of non-cash payments as a transaction tool. To some extent, the policy to  
implement 100% non-cash transaction is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of transaction time, as stated in 
the Regulation of the Minister of Public Works and Public Housing of the Republic of Indonesia Number 
16/PRT/M/2017. This regulation provides services to toll road users effective, efficient, safe and convenient. 
Precisely, it is necessary to develop technology for cashless payment systems that can facilitate toll road accessibility 
and reduce transaction service time at toll gates. As an effort to overcome congestion at toll gates due to the high 
volume of vehicles, in which non-cash toll transaction is implemented. The application of ETC in Indonesia is not 
only limited vis-à-vis e-toll cards,. That technology development continues so that there is a technology called 
contactless for toll road payments. Contactless transactions are transactions carried out by road users without having 
physical contact with toll transaction equipment.

Abstract  
 
This paper is intended and has objective of providing solutions through creation of clean water access that can be a 
challenge, but the technology exists to ensure everyone can drink safely. This paper addresses specific challenge refers 
to solve iron-polluted water resources and design an add-ons filter cartridge to eliminate the iron content for drinking 
water. With a population of 270 million people in 2020, Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world 
and claims Southeast Asia’s largest economy. For many households, water sources are distant, contaminated, or 
expensive, and household sanitation is unaffordable. The Director-General of WHO once said that safe water, 
sanitation, and hygiene at home should not only be a privilege of only those who are rich or live in urban centers. 
These are some of the most basic requirements for human health, and all countries have a responsibility to ensure that 
everyone can access them Manganese greensand is a specially processed medium for iron, manganese, and hydrogen 
sulphide removal. This premium non-proprietary filter medium is processed from glauconitic greensand on which a 
shiny, hard finite thickness manganese oxide coating is formed and is firmly attached on every grain by a controlled 
process. Ultimately, this paper is elaborated within research methodology perspectives on Product Design Engineering 
and Industrial Engineering.

4. 
The bottom end of pipe has very small holes to allow access for filtered water to pass through. 
 
At this point, a survey was made regarding water dispenser and customer’s inputs for its current capability. The survey 
was held on August 19th 2021 on Google Form with 27 respondents with 92.6% of them claimed to have water 
dispensers. Inputs about their current water dispensers are collected as Voice of Customers (VOC) and is shown below:

The next step is to form a design requirement, which is divided into two criteria: Primary and Secondary. Primary 
criteria focus on the main thing that user needs the most, to be part of and produced into the developing product, while 
secondary criteria help the performance of the product and is based on what user wants. However, this criterion is not 
the main part of product’s design solution; it becomes the supporting factor for a better quality of the product.

affordable drinking water. The clean water is manufactured by Nazava filters, with its benefit of exposure to pathogens 
and illness to be prevented in ubiquitous households. It translates saving efforts within several hours per week not 
looking for fuel wood. In addition to that, saving money is achieved to avoid avoiding expensive bottled water or 
originated from  merchants. 
 
The Pugh Matrix is a criteria-based decision matrix which uses criteria scoring to determine which of several potential 
solutions or alternatives should be selected. The technique gets its name from Stuart Pugh and has become a standard 
part of Six Sigma methodology. It is typically used after the development of the VOC (Voice of the Customer) and 
after the creation of a QFD (Quality Function Design).

Abstract 
Performance measurement (PM) in public sector organizations plays an important role in measuring progress toward 
achieving organizational goals, improving performance, and transforming the organization to be more efficient and 
effective in delivering public services. Over the last two decades many public sector organizations have introduced 
legislations and frameworks to improve the management of performance. However, public sector organizations are 
not relying on a universal performance measurement system (PMS) and one recipe to measure performance 
additionally the increase of performance measurement systems complexity led to an increase in the amount of data to 
be acquired, processed, and analyzed. Over the last few years, a growing interest in employing big data analytics 
(BDA) use cases emerged in different public sector domains pursuing the opportunities and potentials of big data 
analytics to handle the increased amount of structured and unstructured data to support decision-making. A 
Systematics Literature Review (SLR) is carried out with a combination of text mining techniques and Machine 
Learning algorithm to automate publication classification was introduced to reduce the burden of study selection 
process and identifying the most relevant publications to the context of this research.

1. Introduction 
A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a well known research method which researchers and practitioners are using 
it to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research as well as when many studies have been 
published and there are uncertainties about the results. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are becoming more 
demanding given the ever-growing number of publications and the increasing breadth of research questions (Popoff 
et al. 2020). SLR collects relevant evidence on the given topic that fits the pre-determined eligibility criteria and to 
have an answer for the formulated research questions. The systematic review should follow a clearly defined protocol 
or procedure where the criteria is clearly stated before the review is conducted. Systematic reviews often, but not 
always, use statistical techniques (meta-analysis) to combine results of eligible studies. Meta-Analysis is used to weigh 
and compare and to identify patterns, disagreements, or relationships that appear in the context of multiple studies that 
have been selected based on the predefined SLR procedure and the results are obtained by implementing statistical 
methods. 
Today we can capture so much information electronically, we call many things ‘data’ that would not have been called

we found that descriptive and predictive analytics are heavily used in measuring performance. However, the level of 
adopting advanced big data analytical methods such as prescriptive analytics is still low. In this work a portfolio of 25 
big data analytics use case for public sector organizations were collated with a demonstration of the purpose, data 
sources, analytical methods, and the impact for each use case. Furthermore, we found that the employment of big data 
analytics use cases would have a significant impact on improving public sector performance measurement mainly in 
improving decision quality, detecting fraud, customers profiling, customize service delivery, support decision making, 
cost saving, and forecasting of future and demands.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to analyze the roles of steel industries in the national economy of Japan. This study 
employs Input-Output (IO) analysis as an analysis apparatus. More specifically, this study uses the parts of IO analysis, 
namely simple output multiplier, simple household income multiplier, index of the power of dispersion, and index of 
the sensitivity of dispersion as analysis instruments. The analysis period of this study is from 1985 through 2005. In 
this study, the analyzed sectors are (1) pig iron and crude steel, (2) steel products, and (3) steel castings and forgings, 
and other steel products. The results show that, by using simple output multiplier, one can say that one of the analyzed 
industries, steel products, attracted consistently the Japanese economy on the analysis period. The same attractiveness 
could be observed on pig iron and crude steel sector from 1985 through 1995. Meanwhile, by using both indices, one 
can claim that the analyzed industrial sectors had a consistent pattern regarding the quadrant location on the period of 
analysis. More specifically, pig iron and crude steel, and steel products sectors were in quadrant I from 1985 through 
2005 while steel castings and forgings, and other steel products sector lied in quadrant IV on the same period. Based 
on these quadrant positions, one can say that the analyzed industries had strong effects on the entire Japanese industries 
on the analysis period.

1. Introduction 
The industrial sectors are important parts of a country. Their contributions can be seen on the micro and macro aspects 
of a national economy. Also, their important roles can be observed both in developed and developing countries. One 
of the industrial sectors that worth to be discussed in this matter is the steel industry. 
 
There are many previous studies discuss the steel topic. For example, Al-Karawi (2022) examines the enhancement 
in local residual stresses and hardness in S355 welded structural steel by means of two post-weld treatment approaches, 
namely High-Frequency Mechanical Impact (HFMI) treatment and Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) remelting. Latour et al.

Abstract 
 
Scheduling involves determining the start and the end time of resource assignments, events, or tasks to achieve a 
particular goal. A good schedule can increase the efficiency and the utilization of resources. The University 
Examination Timetabling Problem (UETP) is an NP-hard problem that determines the schedule of exams given 
students’ exam lists and limited period and room. This study proposes using a Great Deluge Algorithm (GD) with 
local search operators to solve the UETP. The method is used to generate solutions for the uncapacitated Toronto 
benchmark datasets. The proposed method shows promising results compared to the original Great Deluge Algorithm 
and the Modified Great Deluge Algorithm available in previous literature.

1. Introduction 
Scheduling is a decision-making process used regularly in various manufacturing and service industries. Scheduling 
involves allocating resources to activities in a specific timeframe to optimize objectives (Pinedo 2008). The scheduling 
process involves setting limited resources to meet a particular goal while satisfying constraints (Aldeeb et al. 2019). 
Schmidt and Stroehlein (1980) define scheduling as the control of participants, meetings, and periods so that all 
meetings can be done in available periods for all participants. There are many different scheduling applications, such 
as nurse scheduling, transportation scheduling, disaster management scheduling, production scheduling, employee 
scheduling, educational timetabling, etc. Scheduling provides benefits such as increasing time efficiency and resource 
utilization. 
 
Highly complex scheduling problems have a non-deterministic polynomial solving time, better known as NP-hard 
(Abayomi-Alli et al. 2020). The high complexity of scheduling problems makes it a compelling topic for research. 
Educational timetabling is among the most frequently researched and developed from various scheduling problems. 
One of the reasons is that educational timetabling is needed each semester and each year in all academic institutions 
(Qu et al. 2009). 
 
Burke et al. (2007) state that educational timetabling generally deals with a set of activities (classes, exams, etc.) that 
needs to be allocated in a specific period. These allocations need to be organized while satisfying two types of 
constraints: hard and soft constraints. Hard constraints cannot be violated, usually because of physical constraints such 
as classes taken by the same group of students. On the other hand, soft constraints need to be satisfied as much as 
possible. 
 
Educational timetabling problems are divided into several sub-problems, with the most common being the Course 
Timetabling Problem (CTP) and the Examination Timetabling Problem (ETP). ETP is also further divided into other 
sub-problems: the University Examination Timetabling Problem (UETP), where the subject matters are specific to 
universities. Scheduling in universities is naturally a complex problem, with variables such as subjects, lecturers, 
students, rooms, time, and preference. With universities still scheduling manually, aligning all those variables 
generally takes a long time.

6. Conclusion  
This research proposes a great deluge algorithm to solve the Uncapacitated Examination Timetabling problem. Results 
suggest that in its current state, the algorithm can generate valid solutions. We also compared the solution of our 
proposed algorithm with the solutions from previous works. We believe our proposed algorithm can be further 
improved in future research. One way of improvement would be to write a more efficient code for the algorithm. 
Another avenue of research could be parameter tuning for each specific instance. We would also like to compare this 
algorithm directly with a SA algorithm in the future. Applying the algorithm with a real-world dataset would also be 
a possible future research topic.

However, the solutions given are still far from the current best-known solution for UUETP, where the gap of objective 
values varies between the instances. The smallest gap is in instance sta83 with a 0.84% difference, where sta83 is one 
of the smallest instances. The biggest gap is for instance pur93 with a 96.43% difference, where pur93 is one of the 
largest instances. This aligns with the fact that larger instances are more complex. Results also suggest that 
improvements to the solution could be done with better parameter tuning and a more efficient code. 
 
4.4 Parameter Testing 
Parameter testing is also done using analysis of variance to check parameters that have significant effects on the 
proposed algorithm. There are four parameters that are tested, each having three levels. The initial normality test 
indicates that the residuals are normally distributed, thus fulfilling the normality assumption. Table 7 shows the levels 
and p-values of the tested parameters. The analysis suggests that the tested parameters have no statistical significance 
towards the means of the objective value. Furthermore, interactions between factors also show p-values larger than 
0.05, suggesting no statistical significance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the suggested model can be used with 
minimal parameter tuning.

Abstract  
 
This research was conducted to find out how the green manufacturing policy and state-owned enterprise (SOE) 
performance are affecting China’s economic growth in the last 10 years. By using a qualitative approach based on 
secondary data, with the diamond theory of Michael Porter as an analytical tool, it can be said that the SOE in China 
has an important role in economic development in China, while trying to adapt and improve their green policies.

1. Introduction  
China is one of the countries that has succeeded in developing its economy through foreign direct investment (FDI) 
and multinational companies (Kim and Park 2015). China is now starting to target the United States in the country's 
GDP ranking. During the last 20 years, China emerged and became a country with very fast economic growth (Paul 
2015). Thanks to their fast-economic growth, China emerged and became a nation that was recognized by others. 
According to the World Bank, China now has become second to the United States in terms of GDP (current US$) in 
2020. Despite being the second largest nation, China’s economic growth has been slowing down since 2008, from 
14.2% to 9.6%. China had an increase in 2010 of 10.6%, but started slowing down again in 2011 with 9.6%. Since 
then, their economic growth has been slowing down (IMF). Several factors, like the global financial crisis in 2008, 
convergence effect, and structural problems are the main issues for China’s economic growth to slow down (World 
Bank Document). On the other hand, one of various factors that makes China’s become one of the biggest nations is 
their state-owned enterprise. 
SOE itself has existed since the 19th century. The Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region is one of the regions 
that has used SOE for a long time. Public companies began to emerge due to lack of water supply. As in the state of 
Chile in 1884 which inaugurated the State Railway Company to unite trade between companies, offer low tariffs for 
the agricultural sector, and strengthen state control in the country (Guajardo 2007). In the late 19th century, the rise 
of SOE began to be seen from the increasing role of SOE in infrastructure financing, as happened in Peru (Marichal 
2011). State interference in corporations grew stronger in the 1930s. SOEs are also beginning to adopt different and 
planned roles, such as investors and entrepreneurs (Millward 2005). In this second wave, SOE began to spread to 
Europe and also to other developing countries (Enrique  2016). China and several countries that used to be Soviet 
allies, began to adopt the SOE system. Most of the countries that started using SOE used partial disinvestments as

China in terms of demand conditions. 
c. 
Strategy, structure, and competition: For CMCC, there are China telecom and China Unicom. For Aeroflot, 
it is still S7 Airlines. A campaign was added by SLG that allowed SOE shares to be bought by private capital. 
But, the ‘double-hundred actions’ is not successfully reducing state control over pilot SOE. Russia on the 
other hand, plans to sell stakes of their SOE while continuing to hold a significant degree of ownership. For 
that reason, Russia is more competitive in this factor than China. 
d. Supporting industries: China is still more competitive than Russia in this factor. They did not lack supporting 
industries to support their SOE and the government itself always babysits the SOE’s.

Opportunity: COVID-19 is the variable in this factor. Despite being the first one to get hit by the Pandemic, 
China also became the first country to recover. So, China is more competitive than Russia in this factor. 
f. 
Government: Despite being the first country that was affected by the Pandemic, China also became the first 
country to recover its economy. China proved to be more competitive than Russia in terms of policymaking.  
This year, China is trying to achieve sustainable industrialization goals by making industrial parks. There were already 
215 industrial parks at the national level and over 1000 industrial parks at the provincial level. Russia also tries to 
achieve the goals by focusing on energy efficiency to reduce emissions. China also has the Low-Carbon Development 
Strategy which provides for an increase in emissions up to the year 2050. 
5. Conclusion  
State capitalism that is used by China is inseparable from their SOEs. Their role in China’s economic growth is very 
important and impactful to the extent that the Chinese government is willing to spend capital and policy to keep their 
SOEs running. The variables in diamond theory can determine whether a country is competitive or not. From the 
discussion sector, we saw that China excels Russia in several variables and it makes China more competitive than 
Russia.  
This research intends to show that despite the unique way China uses its SOEs, they still manage to grow its economy 
beyond everyone's expectations. But, their policy for their SOEs is changing and trying to adapt to the world economy. 
Green manufacturing also became one of the reasons why China’s economy is slowing down. Trying to adapt its 
policy to environmental issues as the basis of its industrial production. Hopefully, this research can become one of the 
guides for when scientists want to see the good and flaws in China’s policy on their SOE.

Abstract 
 
Recent studies have shown that knowledge management holds a very important role in determining a company 
innovation, especially when it comes to their product development process. This study aims to design a business 
process that will combine both product development process and knowledge management for IT Industry as it is one 
of the industries with the highest innovation growth in Indonesia. This study will use risk management framework to 
identify, eliminate and minimize risk in designing the product development process. Analytical Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) will be used in to assess which 
knowledge management method is the suitable activity that can support knowledge conversion process for each step 
of product development process. At last, both product development process and knowledge management activities 
will be combined and mapped as one whole business process as an innovation process guideline for IT Industry in 
Indonesia.

1. Introduction 
Knowledge management can be defined as a process of capturing, disseminating and using knowledge effectively in 
a company or business entity. Knowledge management is a very important process within the company, because the 
process has a very large influence on the quality of innovation that can be produced by a company, although it does 
not have a direct impact. 
 
The importance of the knowledge management process in a company produces a separate function or unit that is tasked 
with carrying out the knowledge management process in the company as a whole which ultimately produces important 
information for the innovation process called Knowledge Intensive Business Services or can be abbreviated as KIBS 
(Muller & Zekker  2001). Some companies decide to outsource to other companies to carry out the functions of KIBS, 
but there are also companies that use their internal human resources to carry out the functions of KIBS in an implicit 
and divided manner. The process carried out by KIBS is an important key in the company's innovation process in 
other words, it has a very large influence on the New Product Development process (Lee et al.  2003; Martinez-
Fernandez & Martinez-Fernandez  2015). 
 
Like KIBS which has a focus on renewable technology, reported by thejakartapost.com in 2021, the information and 
communication technology sector is predicted to be the sector that has the biggest influence on Indonesia's economic 
growth in 2022 which is driven by the COVID-19 pandemic phenomenon, which is predicted IT sector will grow 
9.8% - 10.3% based on the projection made by the Fiscal Policy Agency. 
 
This study seeks to create an overall business process design to describe the product development process along with 
the knowledge management activities in it.

1795","6. Conclusion  
This study aims to describe the overall business process to describe the innovation process based on the product 
development process and knowledge management activities. Data processing was carried out using the Analytical 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods.  
 
It can be seen from the calculation above, each phase of product development process has different main challenges. 
However, unintegrated knowledge management activities remain the biggest challenge for all of the phase. Thus, an 
integrated system for knowledge management activities should be developed in order to facilitate the knowledge 
storage and conversion process from the knowledge management activities. 
 
Other than that, this study also calculated the most suitable knowledge management activities for each phase of product 
development process with AHP and TOPSIS. The results of AHP and TOPSIS for the most suitable knowledge 
management activities for each phase of the product development process are: 
 
1. Knowledge repository for phase 1 (ideation and validation) 
2. Talk rooms for phase 2 (design, integration and testing) 
3. Formal training for phase 3 (commercialization, feedback and improvement) 
 
Suggestions that can be given for further research with similar topics are that research can be done by developing a 
knowledge management system and conducting a conformity analysis of the implementation in the company.

Abstract 
 
Information technology, e-commerce, and data analytics have drastically changed the way companies do business. 
Few data related practices are more important than assessing risk; for example, the risk inherent in a firm’s accounts 
receivable (AR). While small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) comprise a large portion of the global economy, they 
may be too small to devote extensive internal resources to risk analysis. At the same time, readily available risk related 
information may be ill suited to the needs of diverse SMEs. We explore the potential for readily available machine 
learning techniques, accessible to SMEs at modest cost, to assess the AR risk faced by a medium sized transportation 
brokerage, John J. Jerue Truck Broker. Of the models considered, linear discriminant analysis performed best when 
risk is modeled with three categories and decision trees performed best when there were two categories. Our results 
demonstrate the potential for SMEs to develop risk assessments to flexibly meet their own diverse needs.

1. Introduction  
 
According to the World Trade Organization (World Trade Organization 2016), small to medium enterprises (SMEs) 
(which employ between 10 and 250 people) and Micro firms (which employ 10 or fewer) account for approximately 
95% of all enterprises and two-thirds of employment worldwide, and half of gross domestic product in developed 
countries. As for larger companies, the extension of credit to customers plays an important role in facilitating 
transactions for many SMEs. For example, transportation brokerage firms incur significant costs to procure carrier 
services well before collecting revenues from consignors. 
 
Clearly, assessing and managing risk in accounts receivable (AR) is important for such firms. However, due to their 
small size and diverse nature, SMEs have limited resources to conduct risk analysis customized to their needs given 
their specific business, locale, and customer mix. They may purchase related measures from companies like Experian 
and Dun & Bradstreet; for example, measures intended to reflect the likelihood a company will face serious financial 
distress within a specified timeframe. The usefulness of such measures is limited for two reasons. First, they are only 
available at infrequently, typically annually or quarterly, while the conditions that influence AR risk for SMEs vary 
continuously. Second, such measures are not adapted to the SMEs particular blend of risk. 
 
Traditional definitions of risk have focused on likelihood of failure from the perspectives of financial institutions (FIs). 
FIs are distinguished from other businesses by their use of lending as a primary function, rather than its use to facilitate 
transactions. Most definitions of failure refer to a ratio of debts to assets that is thought to indicate serious likelihood 
of nonpayment or financial distress (see Altman and Saunders (1997) for example). Data in this setting is often 
available on a quarterly or yearly basis and consists of information such as historic creditworthiness and current and 
historic earnings. 
 
Following the 2008 financial crash, emphasis was placed on systemic risk. Systemic risk measures (SRMs) focus on 
failure as it relates both to individual institutions and the system in which they operate. Several different approaches 
to its measurement exist, see Danielsson et al. (2011) for an overview. Research in this area tends to focus on the

values used for the model were 𝛼𝛼= 0 and 𝜆𝜆= 10−4.

5. Conclusion 
The final model was implemented in 2018 by the AR department at John J. Jerue Trucking. It is used to provide 
weekly updates on customers needing additional attention for collections purposes. The model is refreshed with new 
data based on corrections from AR experts over time and occasional resurveys. This prevents the model from 
stagnating and allows the company to adapt (nearly) continuously to both internal and external changes. 
 
Approaches to tailored risk modeling like the one presented have the potential to increase efficiency and profitability 
by focusing limited resources in an AR department where they are most needed. Although the subset and model 
selection used here should not be generalized to other businesses, the concept of tailored SME risk assessment can fill 
the gap between SMEs and large enterprises and FIs in a way that is suited to the diverse needs of SMEs. 
 
Despite its success, our approach has limitations. First, all information driving the model comes from within the 
company itself, posing an inherent risk of customer misclassification or potential bias. Future iterations might be 
improved by including other measures specific to the business, such as their credit score, obtained from other sources. 
This initial implementation also lacks additional functions that might be useful. For example, later designs might 
include automatically setting credit limits, credit blocking, and other functions where a speedy response might be 
crucial to prevent a negative outcome. 
 
A limited range of models was tested given the specific needs and situation of our particular case, pointing to 
opportunities for future work. Crook, Edelman, and Thomas (2007) provide a survey of major risk-of-failure studies 
that finds neural networks (NNs) perform best in a number of cases. However, we did not consider such models 
because the end users at John J. Jerue Truck Broker require an explanation of risk scores that can be impossible to 
discern from NNs due to their black box nature. However, NNs may prove useful in other SME contexts. Tsai (2008) 
models supply chain cash flow risks employing a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) simulation approach 
to modeling demand distribution, production, inventory, and sales. This approach might also prove useful in some 
SME settings. Michalski (2008) proposed a portfolio management approach to tracking and predicting operational 
risk that focuses on groups of customers and not individual customers, lending itself to optimizing a portfolio of AR 
as one might any group of financial assets. Development of such an approach would likely be useful in many SME 
contexts, including ours.

Abstract 
 
The developing technology and the internet are directly proportional to the rise of internet users and mobile 
applications. This results in competitiveness among many companies. Mobile applications have arisen as a distinct 
type of e-commerce that offers users convenience by saving them time and effort. Moreover, as we are experiencing 
a pandemic, there is a shift in customers’ behavior towards food orders from offline to online ordering. Thus, 
understanding the mobile application driving factors analysis is necessary. In response to this issue, this research is to 
develop a conceptual model, adopting the affordance-SDL theory and TAM, and also to test the model by focusing 
on the outcomes of the continuance intention and brand loyalty of the mobile food application. A survey of 264 
participants was conducted, and the data were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-
SEM). The main contribution of the results is the finding that out of 10 hypotheses, 9 hypotheses are accepted, and 1 
hypothesis is rejected. This study provides a research model of how values and factors on mobile food ordering 
application drive people to be loyal and continuously use the mobile application regularly.

1. Introduction 
Changes and developments will always occur over time. Especially in the field of technology, there is still much that 
can be explored also formulated into innovation. This is also directly proportional to the number of technology users, 
one of which is the use of the internet. Of all internet users in the world, Indonesia is included as one of the countries 
with the largest online market. As of July 2021, online penetration in Indonesia has reached 70%. There is a fairly 
high increase every year and looks promising to increase in the following year (Statista 2021). 
 
Almost everything can be done using the internet. Starting from utilization in the fields of education, general 
knowledge, and social, to use in the work industry. The use of the internet can be done using many containers. One of 
the easiest and most widely used is accessing the internet via mobile. The use of smart cellular (smartphones) also 
increases every year. More and more people are becoming tech-savvy and not a few of them are making the use of 
smartphones a necessity, not just a desire. Mobile internet usage is currently experiencing double-digit growth and 
has reached more than 64% of the population (Statista 2021). This encourages and accommodates the emergence of 
many new ideas and innovations from all walks of life. One of the new things that have been created is the existence 
of an online business model or what is commonly called mobile commerce. Mobile commerce is a new business model 
conducted online, very different from the traditional way. 
 
On the other hand, the pandemic due to the covid 19 virus that is being experienced by people around the world, 
including Indonesia, also requires some modifications and adjustments in carrying out their daily lives. Starting from 
the existence of new regulations such as the 5M health protocol also several additional regulations such as the PPKM 
and PSBB. This of course causes people to change their habits and do more activities at home. These changes in 
behavior and habits affect various industries and the economy, one of which is the food and beverage industry. This 
is supported by a statement delivered by the Director-General of Agro-Industry of the Ministry of Industry, in which 
he stated that people prefer to pack their food or order their food online, which requires the industry to do more and 
be more active in developing innovation (Press Conference Ministry of Industry 2021).

From Tabel 5 we can say that the first hypothesis, the third, the fourth, and the fifth hypotheses statements, all have 
positive results this is consistent with the findings in Fang (2019) following the lens of affordance, confirming that all 
affordances of the proposed application were a significant predictor of VMU. The findings of the study on the link 
between selectivity and VMU are also consistent with Choi (2016)'s prior work, which identified customisation and 
localization as positive drivers that permit a wide range of consumer values in cellular systems. Furthermore, the 
findings show that when customers utilize branded applications, visibility and association enhance their VMU, which 
is mainly unexplored in previous study. 
 
In the sixth hypothesis statement, results in a positive value that has a significant effect, in accordance with previous 
research (Fang 2019). VMU was also successfully translated into CI through suitable brand competence and brand 
warmth, essentially the cognitive and emotional pathways, which narrowed to brand loyalty in earlier research (BL). 
Our empirical study leads a promising avenue for academics to include brand humanization in order to increase our 
knowledge of how new media can facilitate positive brand perception and the resulting loyalty by being one of the 
first to map brand competence and warmth to cognitive and affective considerations (Fang 2019). 
 
The seventh hypothesis statement has a favorable impact and is accepted; this is consistent with prior study by 
Dirsehan & Cankat (2021), which found that using MFOA leads to MFOA satisfaction. In other words, restaurant 
customers place orders through the MFOA, and the MFOA's performance determines their degree of pleasure. People 
have specific expectations before they utilize mobile apps. As a result, the success of mobile applications is determined 
by this expectation. Users evaluate their expectations against the perceived value of what they receive (Chang et al. 
2009; Kotler and Armstrong 2010). 
 
This is a positive value in the statement of the eighth hypothesis, which is consistent with prior research by Dirsehan 
& Cankat (2021), who found that customers have expectations from the usage of MFOA and restaurant brands in this 
study. They rate the level of service they receive based on their usage of MFOA and the restaurant's meal quality 
(Chang et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2012). The findings also show that as long as people are happy with MFOA, they will 
be happy and loyal to the restaurant. 
 
According to prior study by Dirsehan and Cankat (2021), the ninth hypothesis statement has a positive value. 
Customers who are really satisfied become loyal to the restaurant and are more likely to return (Lambin et al. 2007). 
 
According to Dirsehan & Cankat (2021) 's research, the eleventh hypothesis statement resulted in a positive value. In 
line with the existing research, this supports the substantial link between restaurant pleasure and loyalty (Bennett and 
Rundle-Thiele 2004; Cronin et al. 2000; Eriksson and Vaghult 2000). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The main objective of this study is to explore the role of mobile food ordering applications by developing a conceptual 
model of the driving factors focusing on the continuance intention and brand loyalty of the mobile food application. 
In order to fulfill the research objectives, this research begins with designing a conceptual model which is then tested 
using PLS-SEM software.  
 
From a total of 10 hypotheses, there is 1 rejected hypothesis and 9 accepted hypotheses. This means that visibility has 
a significant effect on value in MFOA usage. Then there's interactivity – active control, which has a big impact on the 
value of MFOA usage. In MFOA utilization, association–connectedness has a big impact on value. Additionally, 
selectivity – customisation and localisation have a substantial impact on the value of MFOA utilization. While 
persistence has no bearing on the value of MFOA consumption, it does have an impact. Furthermore, the value of 
MFOA usage has a substantial impact on MFOA retention and satisfaction. Then there's the MFOA satisfaction, which 
has a big impact on restaurant brand satisfaction and loyalty. Finally, customer happiness with a restaurant brand has 
a substantial impact on loyalty to that brand.

Abstract 
 
Cross-docking provides benefits such as facilitating fast and direct unloading, consolidation, and reloading of goods 
from inbound to outbound trucks. The vehicle routing problem with cross-docking (VRPCD) is an extension of the 
vehicle routing problem with an additional constraint in which the depot has a role as cross-dock. The current paper 
provides a mixed-integer linear programming model for the VRPCD that considers multiple products, multiple vehicle 
types, and split pickups and delivery. Based on the literature, we generated two sets of instances, one with a 
homogenous vehicle and one with heterogeneous vehicles. The instances are then solved using the Gurobi Solver. 
Results show that instances with heterogeneous vehicles provide better results but require an increase in computation 
time (median of 37.3% for a 10-node instance with five types of vehicles). Split pickups and deliveries can produce 
lower objective values and generate solutions previously infeasible. The computational results also show that smaller 
instances of 10 nodes can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. However, larger instances of 30 nodes are not 
optimally solved given a limited computation time of 1 hour.

1. Introduction 
Cross-docking is a supply chain strategy in which products are consolidated in a distribution center without storing 
them before sending them to customers. The distribution center is referred to as a cross-dock, where products move 
through them with little to no dwelling period. Using the cross-docking strategy has the benefit of allowing 
consolidation while reducing holding times, which in turn reduces holding costs, order cycle time, and transportation 
costs (Apte & Viswanathan, 2000). The advantages of cross-docking have caused multiple companies to adopt and 
use the strategy, such as Walmart. In a commercial network such as that, multiple products by multiple suppliers need 
to be sent to different customers with varying demands (Su & Liao, 2021). 
 
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a problem that plays a prominent role in logistical and supply chain networks. 
The VRP is a problem where the objective is to find optimal delivery routes from at least one depot to several 
customers (Barbarosoglu & Ozgur  1999). Several additional constraints further categorize the VRP, such as 
Capacitated VRP, Heterogeneous VRP, Muti-Depot VRP, Split Delivery VRP, and VRP with Cross-Docking 
(Archetti & Speranza  2008; Han & Wang, 2018; Mavi et al. 2020). Previous studies on VRPCD linear models have 
provided focused on different factors such as split deliveries and multiple products (Gunawan et al.  2020; Hasani-
Goodarzi & Tavakkoli-Moghaddam  2012). Other studies on this topic use non-linear models to represent the problem 
and heuristics to generate solutions (Birim  2016; Lee et al.  2006).  
 
1.1 Objectives 
This study attempts to create a linear model VRPCD with a combination of factors from previous studies, namely split 
pickups, split deliveries, available routes, multiple products, and heterogeneous vehicles. The proposed model also 
aims to add multiple period deliveries, which means that vehicles don’t need start the delivery at the same time, 
provided that they have enough inventory. Modified parameters to generate data proposed by Lee et al. (2006) are

1827","Other than increasing supply and demand, we also tested the effects of decreasing time horizon towards the total cost, 
with and without split pickups and deliveries, which can be seen in Figure 3. Like the previous case, the decrease in 
the time horizon causes an increase in the total cost. In the tested instances, split deliveries also enable previously 
infeasible cases. Also like the previous case, having split pickups and deliveries decreases the cost compared to not 
having them. Specifically, in the case of increasing supply and demand having split deliveries lowers the average cost 
by 4.45%, in the case of reducing time horizon, it reduces the average cost by 6.40% (infeasible cases are ignored in 
the calculation). 
 
5. Conclusion  
We proposed a mixed-integer linear model of a VRPCD problem with multiple products, heterogeneous vehicles, split 
pickup, split deliveries, and available routes. However, in this case, we assumed that all routes are available for use. 
We also modified the VRP-MPCD benchmark instances to accommodate heterogeneous vehicles. The instances are 
solved using our proposed mixed-integer linear model with the Gurobi solver. Results show that instances with 
heterogeneous vehicles provide better results with a median of 37.3% for a 10-node instance with five types of 
vehicles. However, having heterogeneous vehicles require a longer computational time. A more efficient heuristic 
method can be used to solve larger problems, which can be done as an opportunity for future work. We also tested the 
advantages of having split pickups and deliveries, which can help at higher demand numbers and even produce 
solutions that were infeasible for the model without split pickups and deliveries. Other avenues of future work may 
also focus on formulating a model which ties delivery speed to the objective function.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, we present an autonomous vehicles (AV) research testbed with photo-realistic visualisation and 
simulation capability. Compared to Oak Ridge National Labs CAVE system, Microsoft’s AirSim, and MATLAB’s 
Vehicle Dynamics Blockset approach, the key difference is a decoupled and modular system architecture which allows 
developers to focus on only one aspect of the whole system and be productive with minimal training. Basically, the 
proposed system has a game engine, an external hardware accelerator for vehicle dynamical models, and a GPU 
equipped computer to run the AI algorithms. Our vision is to have all vehicle dynamical models to be built in 
MATLAB/Simulink and run on a hardware accelerator like Speedgoat, which is a leading software and hardware 
framework for scientific system modelling and hardware in the loop simulation. The proposed photo realistic 
visualization environment is Unreal Engine based, and all AI models are keras based. This decoupled system 
architecture allows all vehicle dynamical models and AI decision making to be implemented outside the Unreal 
Engine, while the game engine doing all collision detections and reporting. Similarly, all traffic and pedestrian 
movement stochastic models can be implemented outside the game engine, allowing a framework agnostic approach 
to be used throughout the whole system.

1. Introduction  
 
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have potential to improve transportation efficiency and reduce traffic accidents. 
There have been very promising developments in AV research. For example, in (Bojarski et al. 2016), NVIDIA 
demonstrated a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a single front-looking camera system for end-to-end 
steering. There are several AV research testbeds, for example (Gong et al. 2019), and (Baker et al. 2018). Authors 
would like to cite (El-Tawab et al. 2020), (Somogyi et al. 2018), and (Hafez et al. 2020) as alternative testbeds as well. 
 
However, there is one fundamental difficulty in most of these reported research directions. Physically testing AVs 
for different scenarios is time consuming and may not be 100% safe for the vehicle team, nearby drivers, and 
pedestrians. Because of this difficulty in testing and verification of AVs, we propose a photo-realistic simulator which 
can be used to test any vehicle in almost any environment. The proposed system allows changes in light conditions, 
weather, and elevations. Furthermore, the vehicle dynamical model, i.e. the differential equations describing the 
motion of the vehicle, can easily be changed. Finally, different traffic and pedestrian models can be generated without 
changing anything in the game engine. All of these are also decoupled form the AI algorithm used for navigating the 
vehicle. The main goals of our research are (1) Simulate realistic vehicle dynamics defined in MATLAB/Simulink,

6. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we have summarized the design of a low-cost testbed for AV research. Similar to the CAVE system 
of Oak Ridge National labs (Smith 2022), we have a photo-realistic environment built using a game engine. However, 
we have a decoupled system architecture with vehicle dynamical models built in MATLAB/Simunlink, 
traffic/pedestrian patterns realized in Python, and autonomous navigation algorithms running on a physically separate 
GPU equipped computer. The main advantage of this modular approach is, three or more different developers having 
completely different skills and technical background can work in a quite productive way with minimal training. 
Overall, the proposed system is expected to ease and accelerate AV research.

Abstract 
 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is continuing to gain traction as technology improves and there is increased data collection. 
AI can assist society by predicting future phenomena and thus this leads to more efficient processes, increased profits, 
and lower costs. The evolving world environment is leading to increased pressure for food, energy and water resources 
and it becomes increasingly important to manage these resources. AI can be utilized in the form of the internet of 
things (IoT), which are sensors and devices that collect data, to help manage natural resources. In this paper, several 
machine learning models are employed to predict crop yield. Crop yield is an important factor for many countries and 
can be an indicator of food security. The ability to predict crop yield is of increased importance as it can aid 
policymakers in planning future food supply and can aid in the development of a smart irrigation system. A case study 
of sugarcane in the state of Florida is utilized, along with climate and soil variables. As a follow up to the results of 
the machine learning models on crop prediction, this paper introduces an optimization model that develops the smart 
irrigation system. The model chooses the optimal amount of irrigation and fertilizer needed to maximize crop yield 
while also minimizing costs, water, and energy resources. The machine learning models identify the most important 
variables needed for crop prediction and can be applied to other crops in other regions of the world.

1. Introduction 
Dealing with risk and uncertainty, team resilience plays key role in the successful project management.  When 
performing their project tasks, the team faces the dynamics in the projects will lead to major challenges or stress.  
Therefore, resilience project team who are able to bounce back from a negative experience are less likely to experience 
the detrimental effects of intimidating uncertain situations will be crucial for the successful of the project.  Resilience 
studies in individual level have been extensively studied. In Scopus database the search result for resilience hit more 
than 137.000 articles and more than 17.000 are about individual resilience.  Organizational resilience search hit more 
than 4.000 articles.  Yet, team resilience only hit less than 2.500.   
 
1.1. Objectives 
This study aims to see whether transformational leadership influence both individual and team resilience, and whether 
individual resilience influence team resilience.  This study also aims to see the mediation effect of individual resilience 
to the relationship between transformational leadership to team resilience. 
 
2. Literature Review 
The project work is structured in and arounds teams (Moga  2017). Dealing with risk and uncertainty, team resilience 
plays key role in the successful project management.  When performing their project tasks, the team faces the dynamics 
in the projects will lead to major challenges or stress (Killen et al. 2008;  Killen & Hunt  2010; 2013); (Teller  2013; 
Teller & Kock  2013). Resilient teams are more likely to be productive, agile and innovative during the turbulent times 
(Sharma & Sharma  2016). The difference between resilience team and not could be the difference between survival 
and broke down when facing adversity (Vera  2017).

Figure 1 shows that the directional of relationships between transformational leadership to individual resilience, 
transformational leadership to team resilience and individual resilience to team resilience are positive.  Based on the 
T value (value under the bracket), it can be concluded that all relationships are significant.  
 
The relationship between transformational leaderships transformational leadership to individual resilience is positive 
significant.  The relationships between transformational leadership to team resilience is also positive significant. The 
positive significant relationship is also found between individual resilience to team resilience.  Therefore, it can be 
concluded that the relationship between transformational leadership to team resilience is partially mediated by 
individual resilience. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Having team resilience is critical for project management team since project management teams have to deal with risk 
and uncertainty.  This study confirms that having individual which is resilience him/herself will help the establishment 
of team resilience.  This study also confirms that having transformational leadership style influence the resilience of 
the team.  Furthermore, the relationship between transformational leadership to team resilience is partially mediated 
by individual resilience. 
 
This study only evaluates the people aspect in building resilience team.  Referring to Resources Based Theory (RBT), 
further study to see resources aspect can be recommended.  This study only evaluates up to the team resilience, further 
study to whether having team resilience influence team performance after unfavorable situation is also recommended.

Abstract  
 
The prospective is a tool that allows to generate future scenarios; however, there are only few studies regarding a 
prospective for the copper mining sector.  The Mining sector is very important for Peru, since it contributes 10% to 
the national GDP and represents 65.7% of all exports. However, the processing of copper generates large 
environmental impacts, such as: gaseous emissions, particulate matter, dumping and hazardous solid waste. On the 
other hand, this is a strategic prospective study with a mixed approach, in order to determine future sustainable copper 
mining scenarios and contribute to the improvement of sustainability. In the methodology, the MICMAC was used to 
determine the key variables, the Mactor and Smic-Prob-Expert software to play the game between actors and define 
future scenarios respectively. For this reason, it is suggested that mining companies optimize the roasting, fusion and 
conversion processes. In addition, it is suggested that they control the management of contaminants in the copper 
concentrate, as well as increase the efficiency of the acid plant to levels greater than 99.99%. Finally, 64 scenarios 
have been generated, of which it was considered that scenario 1 is the best sustainable scenario for the copper mining 
industry, since it has the highest probability of occurrence with 0.481 and it is where all the hypotheses are fulfilled.

1. Introduction 
This article analyzes the strategic prospective to improve the sustainability of the copper mining industry in Peru. This 
sector is very important for the economic sustainability of Perú since it has one of the longest mining history in South 
America (De Echave 2020). The stellar place of this activity in the country's productive matrix was validated by 
performing the Porter analysis and the PESTLE of the macro context in which the Peruvian copper mining industry is 
located. Its most relevant characteristics are the current requirement of environmental protocols and quality 
certifications, the low cost of production and the dependence on the economic model. However, this industry faces 
multiple problems such as the environmental impact of mining projects and poor management of production processes. 
Covre et al. (2021) explain that incorrect disposal of copper mining wastes can threaten the ecosystem and human 
health due to high levels of potentially toxic elements released into the environment.  Essentially, we can distinguish 
two dimensions in this issue: environmental and social. The environmental dimension mainly covers air pollution 
from gas emissions, particulate matter and the generation of tailings resulting from mining activities, as indicated by 
Ávalos (2018), a large part of the mining sector has fines for non-compliance with the Maximum Permissible Limits 
(MPL). The Sankey diagram of Ávalos (2021) shows that the main outputs in the copper production process are solid 
waste gas and emissions such as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter (Figure 1).

1860","6. Conclusion 
Compliance with the general objective is verified, which is the identification of possible future long-term scenarios. 
Likewise, regarding the first specific objective, the diagnosis of the current situation of the copper mining industry 
indicates that it has high levels of emissions of gases and particulate matter that in many cases exceed the LMP. 
Regarding the second specific objective, 31 variables were identified, which were validated by the experts. Also, in 
the third specific objective, the structural analysis was carried out, where the 6 key variables were determined and the 
relationships between actors were analyzed. Finally, in the fourth specific objective, the validation of findings was 
carried out where 64 future scenarios were generated. According to experts, the combination of the 5 variables within 
the EIA will allow achieving sustainable copper mining, which would be the best scenario. Therefore, for shareholders 
to be able to migrate towards a sustainability scenario, they must rethink the way in which the Environmental Impact 
Study (EIA) is going to be reformulated., In other words, the project must be oriented with a preventive approach on 
contamination and not from a corrective one.

Abstract 
South Korea has achieved remarkable success in promoting its pop culture products ranging from music to films. K-
pop and K-drama are the two main exports that have helped to improve the country’s international image, aside from 
accumulating substantial economic gains. Many K-pop idols are extremely popular, especially those in the boy and 
girl groups. Yet, it is interesting to examine whether this fame will eventually help them to shape how fans are 
perceiving feminism? Particularly amidst a deeply entrenched patriarchy society rooted in Confucianism. Using the 
experience of two members of the Red Velvet (a girl group) who openly expressing their support towards feminism, 
this study finds that the decision was deemed selfish and risking the entire group. The backlash that the idols received 
is rather harsh and exaggerated.

1. Introduction 
Several years ago, Korean culture or known as the ""Korean Wave"" has spread throughout the world, especially in 
Asian countries. South Korean culture, known as music (K-pop), dance (girl group/boy group), drama (K-Drama), as 
well as food, fashion, skincare/makeup, and language (Hangul) have become a global trend. The Korean Wave is 
indeed being used by the South Korean government as a policy tool to enhance diplomacy. The South Korean Foreign 
Minister Kim Sung-hwan, argues that the Korean Wave promotes Korea's national interests in enhancing the country's 
international image. South Korea's cultural fame became one of the factors of the economic miracle for the South 
Korean nation after the crisis and advanced the country's economy by contributing 30% of GDP. As a result, the 
success of the Korean Wave may have significantly helped the country's economy (Zhang   2020). 
The Korean Wave was marked by the success of K-drama Winter Sonata and Full House in the early 2000s (Bok-rae 
2015), then followed by the trend of famous K-pop groups with many members that sang while dancing. Super Junior 
is one prime example of a famous Korean boy group in the world. Even this boy group managed to sell all their concert 
tickets in every country they visited. Not only boy groups, but girl groups also have the same influence as boy groups. 
Entertainment companies work really hard to produce quality members of their idols. These examples give an impact 
on the world that South Korea has something to be proud of and then become an asset of South Korean pride. It also 
opens the door for the South Korean nation to promote South Korean culture as well as creative industries on a global 
scale. That's where South Korean culture is known and influences the creative industry to create new economic 
resources for them besides science and technology (Bok-rae  2015).

1872","of women refuse to identify as feminists, and only 18% of women and 11% of men thought the term was a compliment 
(Bir  2021).  
 
Bir (2021) suggest the common theme that emerges is to be authentic, consistent, and support statements with concrete 
actions that benefit the feminist struggle. Community leaders also risk their reputations if they come across as 
inauthentic, misinformed, unprepared or if comments or actions from their past conflict with their convictions, 
especially with their feminist beliefs. Interviews conducted with five of the leading publicists in the entertainment 
industry revealed that identifying as a feminist helps improve the reputation of public figures if they truly believe in 
the cause and actively participate in the movement. Despite the possible backlash, feminist celebrities earn respect in 
the long run if they are authentic and transparent in their activism (Bir 2021). 
 
K-pop music has had many influences, such as how the country of South Korea can be successful through the 
promotion of its culture by South Korean idols. By seeing firsthand how South Koreans innovate and promote South 
Korean culture, they can learn how culture can be an important component. It is hoped that other countries can learn 
in developing their culture to a higher level (Raven 2020). Seeing this success, it is undeniable that one of the factors 
is the real form of the feminism movement that is built and shared with the world community through the younger 
generation who have the potential to build their economic resources through their own culture. South Korea has also 
succeeded in changing the existing stigma and showing that the power of feminism through culture, especially K-pop, 
is so real. This shows indirectly that Korean music can have such a big impact on world culture. Not only for South 
Korea but extending to surrounding countries (Kim 2019). 
 
5. Conclusion 
Nowadays, the word “feminism” seems to receive a rather negative connotation. A study by Bir (2021) suggests that 
most of the American public (85% among men and 65% among women) do not approve with being labelled as 
“feminist”. The perception towards the advocacy of improving women’s rights and gender equality has distorted into 
a more destructive rather than constructive movement. Furthermore, when celebrities are expressing their supports 
towards feminism, people might think that they merely seeking attention from the public and they get backlash from 
the general public. However, as discussed in the discussion section, this paper has demonstrated that when K-pop idols 
promote feminism in South Korea, the public opinion is divided between those who support and against. With the 
latter being more commonly found among fans, it is clear to suggest that feminism continues to be a taboo ideology 
in South Korea. Red Velvelt personals, Irene and Joy, were widely condemned for expressing their support towards 
feminism by liking a novel and wearing T-shirt that hardly reads “We Should All be Feminists” under her jacket. Due 
to the limited source of data being analyzed in this paper, more research is needed to explore as to how and why the 
stigma surrounding feminism has been so negative and deeply entreched in South Korea, aside from the Confuciasim 
which has been widely assumed reinforcing patriarchy in the country.

Abstract  
 
A company's ability to manage supply chain resilience is a valuable consideration, especially during pandemics such 
as COVID-19. For this reason, researchers are increasingly interested in supply chain resilience, particularly in the 
manufacturing industry, during emerging situations. This study provides insight into the impact of the COVID-19 
outbreak on the automotive industry. This paper examines three years of data from an assembly line that produces 500 
cars per day, analyzes the impact of the spread of the virus on the efficiency of the assembly line, and suggests 
improvements to strengthen the assembly line resilience.

The ongoing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first identified in December 
2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
on March 11, 2020 (Lai et al.  2020). Since then, COVID-19 has rapidly spread beyond China to almost every country 
on the globe (WHO  2020), and at the time of writing this article (April 2022) there have been more than 510 million 
confirmed cases worldwide and more than 6 million of deaths. Otherwise COVID-19 is not only a global pandemic 
or disease that impacts the health of the human being, it has affected also the global economy and financial markets 
(Purwanto et al.  2020). Governments worldwide have increasingly undertaken an inhibition strategy to contend the 
outbreak, relying on widening social distancing, wearing masks, especially in public places and transport, along with 
various other measures in order to reverse the pandemic growth, and thereby manage the resilience of the healthcare 
systems. Notably, these measures in turn have often resulted in stricter border restrictions and complete nationwide 
lockdowns, and in the process thereby, causing a negative short-term impact on consumer spending, investments, and 
disruptions to international trade and global supply chains (Kumar & Managi  2020). Most governments in the world 
underestimated the risks of rapid COVID-19 spread and were mostly reactive in their crisis response (Pak et al. 2020). 
As disease outbreaks are not likely to disappear in the near future, deep analyzing and proactive actions are required 
to not only save lives but also protect economic prosperity (Pak et al.  2020). 
 
This led us to conduct this study in order to analyze the impact of the pandemic on assembly lines. Therefore, the 
proposed comparison metric is the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) launched in 1988 by (Nakajima  1988);

1881","In the new configuration, only 3 connected workstations are needed to perform all the assembly tasks of the line 
instead of 10 unconnected manual workstations as shown previously in Figure 5 and only one quality control operator 
instead of two, data is again collected to calculate the new OEE factors of the line : 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Comparison of OEE factors between during COVID period and after improvements period 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Comparison of OEE between during COVID period and after improvements period 
 
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, OEE improved to excellent levels (78%) that are better than levels during COVID (53%) 
and even better than levels before COVID (68%), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The objective of this paper was to analyze the impact of pandemics on assembly lines in order to propose solutions to 
strengthen the resilience of assembly lines. We mainly focused on the COVID-19 case by studying the case of a 
manual assembly line in a French automotive company located in the city of Tangier, Morocco. In conclusion of this 
article, the authors found that manual assembly lines did not withstand waves of COVID-19 spread, and would not 
withstand future natural outbreaks or pandemics. Therefore, any infectious virus that requires social distancing can 
have a negative impact on its effectiveness. The overall equipment efficiency of the studied assembly line decreased 
from 68% before the pandemic to 53% during the pandemic and the most impact is of the availability and performance

connected assembly lines, workers upgrading and reskilling and respect of sanitary rules, improve the resilience of 
the studied assembly line to the COVID-19 pandemic in particular (line efficiency increased by 47%) and enhance the 
resilience of the supply chain in general.

Abstract  
 
The application of big data solutions to village-level smart farms in the Philippines may not happen immediately. The 
low-fidelity prototype developed in this study should represent a little but determined step closer to such a lofty 
aspiration. The study aimed to develop a prototype for an information system highlighting the application of Big Data 
solutions to village-level smart farms in the Philippines. The study engaged potential early adopters in the systems 
analysis phase and cross-referenced their needs with available technologies. Modeling tools such as the HIPO Chart, 
Systems Flow Chart, Use Case Diagram, and Data Flow Diagram highlighted the systems design phase. Datastore 
elements explained the application of Big Data in optimizing crop yields forecast. Village-level data on yield estimate, 
vegetation indices, pest monitoring, and the relevant analytics can be generated from drone-based, data vegetation 
indices, and data from sensors and drones. Farmer data are consolidated into Cluster and Group data. Big data 
strengthened crop yield forecasting to provide farmers with the best option for the next crop while performing analytics 
to generate highly visual dashboards. The system modules developed for the Farmer, Cluster Technician, and Group 
Manager proved that Big Data solutions can be applied to smart farms in the Philippine setting. The prototype can be 
applied in equivalent operational areas in the poultry, livestock, and aquaculture industries. Equally exciting is an 
application to the development of a coexistence system for genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops. The systems 
analysis and design process likewise provide instructional value.

1. Introduction 
Baseline income growth relied heavily on projected increases in agricultural productivity (Baldos  2014). Sustainable 
information-based intensification requires new technologies, such as sensors and artificial intelligence (Grieve  2019). 
Big data (BD), refers to massive information which requires processing for greater insights (Su  2021) BD is most 
useful in generating forecast models (Hasani  2015). Smart farming (SF) is the use of data technologies to maximize 
the efficiency of complex farming operations. (Alfred  2021). 
 
In the journals reviewed, there is very little that discussed cases or studies relating to Big Data in Smart Farming (BD-
FS), particularly in the Philippine setting. Bersales (2021) listed a total of sixty-nine (69) recorded BD initiatives from 
2004 to 2002, across the globe. Only four out of the 69 projects related to crop production. These four projects include 
the joint project between the Philippine government and two private corporations, which used data from satellite 
technology to provide better 2020 crop insurance in the Philippines. Bersales (2021) did not find any other recorded 
big data initiatives in the Philippines for the period 2004- 2020.

address the indicated exceptions in Clusters 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The insights and discussion from this qualitative study will be enhanced by a more detailed study to feature both 
qualitative and quantitative methods. Time constraints did not allow for a more comprehensive study which should be 
the suggested approach for future research in the field. Knowledge about the potential of the technology can be 
strengthened with an increase in the number of respondents, to ensure that respondents in future studies fairly represent 
the real stakeholders in the adoption of BD-SF in the Philippines. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Stakeholders consider access to visualizations and data analytics, among others, as important factors in considering 
whether big data solutions could improve productivity (Osinga, 2022). The study aimed to develop a low-fidelity 
prototype for an information system highlighting the application of Big Data solutions to village-level smart farms in 
the Philippines. The prototype developed in this study featured dashboards to deliver equivalent functionalities.  
 
The value of BD-SF technology must be matched to the needs of the targeted technology users. A potential early BD-
SF adopter is between 27 to 42 years old, holds a science-related degree, has corporate experience, and is an 
experienced farmer who intends to continue to engage in farming, at least for the next five (5) years. To kick-start the 
sustainable adoption of BD-SF, at least ten (10) village-level farmers fitting this profile should be identified and 
organized into clusters to be supervised by a Cluster Technician. In turn, at least ten (10) of these clusters can be 
organized to form a group, to be headed by a Group Manager. 
 
In the systems analysis phase, the study engaged potential early adopters and cross-referenced their needs with 
available technologies in establishing the systems requirements for the proposed information system. Modeling tools 
and techniques such as the HIPO Chart, Systems Flow Chart, Use Case Diagram, and Data Flow Diagram highlighted 
the systems design phase. Defining the elements of the Data Stores explained the application of Big Data in optimizing 
crop yields forecast. Village-level data on yield estimate, vegetation indices, pest, and disease monitoring, and the 
relevant analytics can be generated from vegetation indices and data from sensors, remote-sensing, and drones. 
Farmer-level data are consolidated into Clusters, and subsequently, into Groups.  
 
The application of big data to smart farms in the Philippines was highlighted in the incorporation of dashboard 
analytics in the proposed information system. A low-fidelity prototype featured modules for three users – Farmer, 
Cluster Technician, and Group Manager. Use cases for managing the plan, managing gaps (against the plan), and 
generating reports culminated in the design of Farmer Dashboards, Technician Dashboards, and Group Manager 
Dashboards. These dashboards provided the access and visualization functionalities important to the stakeholders, 
represented in the study by the potential early adopters.  
 
Organizing the Group into Clusters and Farmers provided a good framework for managing both the physical and 
system environments. The Cluster Technician proposes the regular plans for the Farmers in the Cluster. In case of 
potential gaps against these plans, the Farmer reports these gaps while the Technician recommends the option to 
manage the gap. As a choice, Big Data help provide the best option based on village-level data. In both cases, the 
Group Manager decides on the critical steps in the Manage Gap and the Manage Plan processes. Updated Farmer, 
Cluster, and Group plans provide inputs for Big Data analytics to generate the user dashboards. The system modules 
developed for the Farmer, Cluster Technician, and Group Manager proved that Big Data solutions can be applied to 
village-level smart farms in the Philippine setting in improving crop productivity. Big data strengthened crop yield 
forecasting to provide farmers with the best option for the next crop while performing analytics to generate highly 
visual dashboards for the Farmer, Cluster Technician, and Group Manager.  
 
A similar system should find useful applications in the equivalent operational areas in the poultry, livestock, and 
aquaculture industries. Equally exciting is an application to the development of a coexistence system for genetically 
modified (GM) crops such as Golden Rice and Bt eggplant. The methodology applied in the study provides 
instructional value. The detailed steps involving the selected modeling tools represent a simple and effective 
illustration of the systems analysis and design process. This can be used as instructional material for college-level

immediately. However, the low-fidelity prototype developed in this study. should ably represent a little but determined

Abstract 
 
A large of scaled development is ongoing in the industrial and infrastructure sectors in Indonesia. Megaproject 
especially in construction projects is considered disappointing due to over budget, delayed, and under quality. This 
lack of performance is due to the complexity and uncertainty of megaprojects. Therefore, the aim of this study is to 
discover how to use lean practices to maximize project value, shorten the project schedule, improve project quality, 
and reduce waste in the construction industry. This was achieved by analyzing a case study of a construction project 
in Indonesia. The case study revealed that implementation of critical chain project management as well as lean 
practices during the project, including the Last Planner System (LPS) and continuous improvement, all contributed 
to the improvement of project performance. To supplement the case study and to provide insights on the differences 
between local and international lean construction (LC) practices, interviews with project stakeholders and a 
questionnaire survey of global lean experts were conducted. Results indicated that interviewees and survey 
respondents both held the view that project waiting times and defects can be greatly reduced through the 
implementation of LC, and that improvement of construction workflow along with the project.

1. Introduction  
The ability to manage concurrent projects in the dynamic and competitive modern economic environment becomes a 
key competence that may have a significant impact on building a company’s competitive advantage. The 
construction industry is expected to contribute about 15 percent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is 
projected to exhibit a growth rate of 4 percent annually over the next few years (Betts et al. 2015). This anticipated 
growth makes it one of the fastest progressing sectors in the coming decades. However, Hussin et al. (2013) argue 
the industry’s growth has been constantly challenged by a wide variety of issues such as low productivity levels, 
varying profitability, lack of skilled workforce, project delays, and slow technology adoption. A high level of asset 
specificity makes construction projects uncertain and complex with multiple requirements to be met during the 
design and construction process. Making project management practices sustainable is an essential component of the 
broader mission of making the construction industry, as a whole, truly efficient as well as sustainable. 
Multiple project management is characterized by the complexity of the issues related to planning, organizing, 
coordinating, and controlling a set of projects simultaneously. The dynamic, turbulent, and complex nature of the

This study discussed the application of critical chain and lean project management to improve construction project 
efficiency. It is implemented in a case study of construction project of a large property construction company in 
Indonesia. The data being collected based on interview and survey process conducted prior to the project kick-off. 
The results shown that the critical construction path method is able to identify the activities considered as waste in 
the construction project. Addressing the waste with a proper lean construction tools shown that it is able to increase 
the project efficiency. The ability to manage concurrent projects in the dynamic and competitive modern economic 
environment becomes a key competence which may have a significant impact on building a company’s competitive 
advantage. The construction industry contributes significantly to economic development and social equality of both 
developed and developing countries (Jiang et al.  2019); adding between 7% and 10% of Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP). A high level of asset specificity makes construction projects uncertain and complex with multiple 
requirements to be met during the design and construction process. Making project management practices 
sustainable is an essential component to the broader mission of making the construction industry, as a whole, truly 
efficient as well as sustainable. 
 
The outcome of this study will have a very positive implication for both theoretical and practical body of knowledge 
in project management. Theoretically, this study will provide a deep understanding of lean concepts and will 
encourage the construction companies to start a lean journey for removing wastes and inefficiencies from existing 
management techniques. The removal of waste within the construction projects will make construction more 
sustainable and facilitate in preserving not only the natural material but also the effort required to undertake the 
work. Thereby having a huge positive impact in decreasing the environmental issues associated with the 
construction industry (Nicholas and Steyn, 2020).

Abstract 
 
The current technological growth has pushed the manufacturing sector to undergo important changes during the latest 
fashion in the field of advanced manufacturing, manufacturing articles in full technological development under a 4.0 
environment, manufacturing is no longer just about manufacturing physical products. Here in this article, we seek to 
develop a reinforced biobased composite material based on polypropylene with natural fibers in order to improve its 
mechanical properties, for its application in the automotive and aeronautical sectors or others in general. Highlighting 
the objective, interest, argument of the study and importance of the problem, a chemical characterization methodology 
was used in the natural fibers of banana pseudostem to obtain the best possible results from this study and to be able 
to adhere to a polymeric matrix, thus obtaining a composite material. already prepared, for a study in the second 
methodology now is a physical characterization and to be able to submit it to a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
And to other universal tension and compression equipment, to know their morphology and characterization of the 
fiber and polymeric matrix. This concept of the circular economy has recently been questioned by studies that show 
that the innovation of new composite materials provides remanufacturing, recycling, non-extraction of non-renewable 
materials and the use of clean energy, this is a contribution to the sustainable development objectives of the 2030 
agenda. And it is a very involved topic with today's industrial engineering, since it has a very advanced profile for 
materials, manufacturing, and sustainability.

1. Introduction 
This work seeks to develop a reinforced polymeric material based on a polymeric matrix of polypropylene and natural 
fiber of Banana pseudostem, in the manufacturing industry it produces a considerable impact on the environment that 
is through the extraction of resources. non-renewable natural Natural resources are limited and non-renewable 
resources.. That today manufacturing continues with linear thinking generating more waste instead of switching to 
circular thinking manufacturing, as mentioned in the summary of this article. For this reason, human beings have an 
important role in the construction of sustainability as mentioned in the sustainable development goals of the 2030 
agenda. One of the objectives is to develop a reinforced biobased composite material based on polypropylene with

1911","obtain a composite material, Just as the objective or short summary of this work says, it is to find a new material that 
satisfies certain requirements of other materials and to know what its application would be. The research question is 
mentioned in the body of the work, can a polymeric composite be obtained, which by adding loads of natural fiber 
(pseudo stem of banana) to the polypropylene increases its aging, Young's Modulus, rigidity, and resistance and 
improves the mechanical properties in micrographic studies, then there would be the possibility of developing a 
composite that is cheaper than a composite with synthetic fibers. I mention that in this article it is only a first part of 
the work to be carried out, here only results have been shown where a chemical characterization methodology was 
used to give alkaline treatment to banana pseudostem fibers and obtain the cleanest sample of impurities and with 
more open fibrils, to subsequently submit it to a physical characterization, where it will be subjected to destructive 
tests, such as a universal machine to analyze tension, compression, extension, Young's modulus, aging test, etc. In 
figure 9 of the results, subsection (f) is shown, fiber treated with sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) and shows said cleaning, 
then with that sample a functionalization analysis will be carried out, which has been the art of increasing the affinity 
and improve chemical reactivity with certain molecules, exposing the parts with the greatest tendency to good fiber-
matrix diffusion. The coupling agent to be used in the next research article is with silane, it is a chemical compound 
whose formula is SiH4. They are frequently used to modify surfaces of fibers or particles used as reinforcement in 
organic matrix composites. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Due to the approach that this work has taken, which is mainly focused on studying the chemical characterization of 
the use of banana pseudostem fiber as a reinforcement material for the development of composite plastic materials, 
the results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of use natural plant fibers to prepare ecological compounds for 
applications by suitable methods. In the 2010s and onwards with the increase in CO2 emissions to the environment 
from material processing, the development of environmentally friendly products from natural sources of raw materials 
has become an important research topic. The contribution that can be observed in this thesis is frankly the development 
of a mechanism or theory that leads to the aforementioned theme of this work to a creation of sustainability, but named 
with new terms such as the application of a circular economy, leaving behind the everyday, no longer working or 
thinking in a linear economy, which is to extract, produce and dispose of, explains the European researcher, Ellen 
MacArthur, it is time to start with the circular economy which is, design to last, restore, and regenerate. Elena (2019).

Abstract  
 
The growth in the development of various types of property around the world directly affects the property 
management industry. As an industry that is a continuation of the property development business, the property 
management sector plays a strategic role in securing the value and physical assets of the property that has been 
built. With the various demands from property owners and the increasing variety of types of properties being 
managed as well as increasing competition in this industry, property management businesses must seek 
breakthroughs in improving the quality of services to stakeholders involved in the property. Inefficient and 
effective property management will lead to high costs and decreased service quality. Many institutions in the 
management of property management are competing to make various innovations to be able to make the property 
management process run effectively and efficiently. Information technology and IoT, which are growing rapidly, 
are now an important part used to achieve this goal. Digital transformation in the property management industry 
is an option in the industrial 4.0 era. Many human roles can be replaced by technology, and the application of 
technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), IoT, and various new technologies are increasingly complementing 
the role of technology, especially information technology in digital transformation in the property industry. 
management. By using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) model, this paper wants to dig deeper into how 
the trend of applying digital transformation in the property industry is, which countries have implemented digital 
transformation a lot in their property industry, what models or frameworks are most widely used in the digital 
transformation process then what are the challenges in implementing digital transformation in this property 
industry. This paper is expected to provide an overview of the digital transformation conditions in the property 
management industry that have not been widely disclosed.

1. Introduction 
Digital Transformation or DX is about adopting technology with the aim of increasing productivity, value creation, 
and social welfare. Many countries, multilateral organizations, associations, and industries have made strategic 
studies and plans as the basis for making long-term policies and starting to implement digital transformation. 
(Allen  2019), the property sector is no exception and in a wider area, city management (Barkalov  2020). 
 
The property management industry is becoming increasingly important as the construction and development of 
different types of properties increases and new territories are opened around the world  (Bajpai and  Bagchi  2020) 
Investment growth in the property sector in the Asia Pacific region during 2021 grew 21% after the Covid 19 
pandemic began to decline (Bogataj  2020). The growth of the property sector is widely used as a reference to see 
the economic growth of a country, the higher the investment growth in the economic sector indicates the country's 
economic growth is also high (Burnham  2006)

Abstract 
 
Most researchers have demonstrated the importance and the value of maritime terminal scheduling and 
optimization. The following work is focusing first, on the problem of unloading operations of outbound containers. 
Thus, the sequencing of both Quay crane and truck is studied at the same time. Moreover, the possibility of 
potential interferences between quay cranes and the problem of shifting which significantly influence the 
performance of quay cranes is considered. In the literature, there is no work that combines interferences between 
quay cranes and shifting problem at the same time which is the innovation point of our work. 
The scheduling problem of the operations unloading containers is formulated as a mixed linear program model. 
The objective function is to minimize the makespan of handling operations by the quay cranes. The mathematical 
model is based on various assumptions and it includes the potential interferences and the shifting problem. 
After modeling the mixed linear program, we used AMPL programming software to validate the mathematical 
formulation and to derive the optimization results. 
The solution obtained by AMPL allows us to determine a completion time (483 seconds) for the processing of the 
10 containers presented in the case study as well as the operation of each equipment and the working sequence of 
each (quay crane and truck).

      1. Introduction 
In the field of intermodal transport, the sea route is widely used to transport thousands of tons of goods. The 
products are loaded into containers of standardized dimensions, which are then embarked on ships ensuring the 
connection between the ports. Land transport, making it possible to link these ports to the origins and/or destination 
of the goods, is then carried out by trains or trucks. Commercial ports and terminals therefore constitute the land-
ship interface. They form large logistics platforms where the goods will transit and where the containers will 
undergo a set of handling and storage operations. 
In general, many decision/planning problems need to be resolved, among which we distinguish the problems 
related to the arrival of ships in a port, the loading/unloading of these ships, the transport of containers to a storage 
location (and vice versa) (Vis et al. 2003) , ( Steeken et al., 2004).

6. Conclusion 
In this article, we presented a mathematical formulation of the problem of planning the operations of qard cranes and 
the movements of transport trucks. This formulation allowed us to integrate the hypothesis of the problem as well as 
the objectives assigned. Also, and with fictitious data, we solved the problem with the AMPL software. We obtained 
a solution with a completion time (483 seconds) for the processing of the 10 containers presented in the case study as 
well as the processing sequences of the various handling equipment set up in the maritime terminal. Solving with 
AMPL is the first approach to solving the problem.  
Then and in the context of the next step, we will try to solve the problem with a second resolution approach which is 
the genetic algorithm. 
In contrast to the approach used in this work the heuristic methods have the ability and efficiency to solve optimization 
problems regardless of the size of the problem: 10, 20 and 100 containers. The data that will be used to test the 
approach will be fictitious and multiple instances can be generated by varying the number of containers and/or 
handling equipment available.

Abstract 
 
Coordination in humanitarian operations has always been challenging due to the uncertainty and the complexity of 
the operations. Because no one collaboration strategy fits all, the exploration of coordination mechanisms for a 
particular context is therefore necessary. The present paper aims at investigating the coordination mechanism among 
the key players and identifying challenges of coordination in relief operations in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. 
Qualitative research using semi-structured interviews focusing on coordination mechanism during the preparedness 
and response phases of humanitarian operations was conducted with representatives from governmental regional 
disaster management agency (Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah – BPBD) in both provincial and district levels, 
governmental services, Indonesian bureau of logistics, suppliers, and volunteers including non-governmental 
organizations. The findings entail that the hybrid coordination approach, characterized by a centralized structure 
combined with vertical and horizontal collaboration to ensure smooth aid procurement and distribution, has been 
implemented. The BPBD serves as a director that leads and coordinates the humanitarian operations with other 
involved stakeholders including other governmental services, local and international non-governmental organizations, 
and local and regional communities. The collaborations are engaged at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. 
The findings have indicated that trust, uncertainty/unpredictability, lack of or limited technology for information 
sharing, effect of media, diversity of actors, political issues, resource scarcity were the main reported barriers toward 
coordination in humanitarian operations. Avenues for potential future research are also discussed.

1. Introduction 
A large number of humanitarian organizations (HOs) are mobilized and assembled to save as many lives as possible 
during relief operations. The relief operations are quite complex due to uncertainty in terms of the disaster itself, the 
location of the affected population, the amount and the type of needs, available infrastructure aftermath of the disaster, 
and rapid change in the situation. It is unlikely that a single organization can fulfill the needs. The large number and 
diversity of HOs in terms of organizational size and structure, operational policies and procedures, missions, political 
positions, logistical capacities, experiences, and expertise, are usually involved, which then adds to the complexity of 
the relief operations. Therefore, to fulfill large and changing needs within a reasonable time, coordination is 
unavoidable among the HOs. Uncoordinated operations among the HOs usually result in imbalance relief. As 
evidenced in the case of the Mount Merapi eruption in 2010 (Sopha et al., 2019), uneven distribution occurred - some 
shelters experienced an excess supply while other shelters encountered shortages. Furthermore, expired good items, 
items that do not fit the needs, duplicated efforts for transportation, inappropriate personnel, and help are other 
observed problems in the field. These are contributed to inefficient (wasted valuable resources) and ineffective 
(mistarget beneficiaries) issues. Coordination has played an important role in efficient and effective disaster relief 
operations. 
 
However, coordination in disaster relief operations is challenging. Different from coordination in a commercial setting 
which has been well-understood and successfully implemented, coordination is one of the fundamental weaknesses in 
humanitarian operations (Jahre et al., 2009). The coordination mechanism to connect heterogeneous players to share

has not been able to be assessed, thus suggesting that as future research. 
 
4.3 Challenges in Coordination 
It is also necessary to highlight that one successful practice might not be fit for another, because humanitarian 
operations are influenced by contextual relief situations. Based on the interviews, the factors influencing the successful 
practices of the coordination involve the number and diversity of actors, uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect 
of media, resource scarcity, competition for funding, donor expectations, and funding structure. Furthermore, cultural 
and knowledge barriers (different thoughts and perceptions), ego-sectoral, political issues, limited technology for 
sharing information (mostly using social media), and trust. Table 4 presents the percentage of the respondents who 
perceive the challenges in coordination during humanitarian operations.

It is also interesting to note that, in addition to external and organizational factors as above-mentioned, individual 
factors influencing the coordination is worthy of exploration. Hence, exploring behavioral factors such as that in Sopha 
(2013) but in the context of coordination behavior, swift trust development, sharing behavior (willingness to share), 
during humanitarian operations, is therefore suggested as potential avenues for future research. Moreover, 
identification of barriers and enablers for coordination is also worthwhile to explore. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Coordination has been given special attention in the literature due to its significant role in effective and efficient 
humanitarian operations. It is believed that appropriate coordination mechanisms may be different for different 
contexts and situations. Hence, the present paper contributes to investigating coordination mechanisms among the key 
players and identifying challenges of coordination in relief operations in a case study of humanitarian operations in 
Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. The BPBD is responsible for humanitarian operations during the preparedness and 
response phase of the disaster. The preparedness phase regards disaster risk assessment and preposition inventory, 
whereas the response phase includes disaster assessment, evacuation, and last-mile distribution of aid supplies. 
Qualitative research using semi-structured interviews with the representatives from governmental regional disaster 
management agency (BPBD) in both provincial and district levels, governmental services, Indonesian bureau of 
logistics, suppliers, and volunteers including non-governmental organizations. The findings indicate that the 
provincial BPBD has adopted the hybrid coordination approach characterized by a centralized structure, which is 
combined with vertical and horizontal collaboration to ensure smooth aid supplies and deliveries. Strategic, tactical, 
and operational levels are also adopted for different humanitarian operations. The number and diversity of actors, 
uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect of media, resource scarcity, competition for funding, donor expectations, 
funding structure, cultural and knowledge barriers (different thoughts and perceptions), ego-sectoral, political issues, 
limited technology for sharing information (mostly using social media), trust were perceived to be the barriers.

on identifying barriers and enablers of coordination and exploring behavioral factors underlying coordination, swift

Abstract 
 
This research aims to describe the factors that lead Brazil to succeed in being the biggest coffee producer in the world. 
There are factors that the Indonesian coffee industry needs to learn and see Brazil as a benchmark in the coffee 
industry. The result of this analysis serves as industry solutions for the Indonesian coffee industry. Comparative 
analysis is performed by means of competitive advantage with Porter’s Diamond Model theory approach. Qualitative 
method is used in analyzing the data by using interviews as primary data and journals, annual reports and books as 
secondary data.

1. Introduction 
Brazil and Indonesia were both introduced to coffee through a period of colonization. In 1727, the Portuguese 
introduced coffee to Brazil and was once predominantly consumed by European colonists, however, when demand in 
Europe and the United States expanded, exports began to increase. Because of this burgeoning demand, 1802 was a 
pivot year for exports, and by 1820, Brazil was producing 30% of the world's coffee (Topik 2019). Similarly, in 
Indonesia, coffee plants were introduced by the Dutch traders and colonials in the late 1600’s. They launched coffee 
plantations in 1699, and by 1711, the first major commercial exports started to be known worldwide. Java coffee 
quickly became one of Europe’s preferred sources for beans. Then, as a nation of thousands of islands, Indonesia’s 
coffee plantations spread out to neighboring islands over the next century, some of which are the coffee producing 
region, i.e. Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Bali (Martauli  2018). However, the ""coffee rust,"" a disease that destroyed the 
coffee industries of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, in the mid to late 1800s, allowed Central and South America 
the opportunity to truly grow as a coffee area. Hence, in the 1910s, Brazil grew 80 percent of the world's coffee (Waller 
et al. 2007).  
 
However, when other producing nations gradually recovered, the country's share of the market fell, but it never lost 
its position as the world's greatest producer. In the beginning of 1990s, Brazil's government deregulated a range of 
agricultural industries, including coffee. Farmers were given a lot of flexibility to experiment, seek their own buyers, 
and sell their crops in ways they see benefit for themselves. This momentum opened the doors to innovation and 
escalated development within the coffee industry, in short moments afterwards, Brazil became a world leader in the 
coffee industry. Coffee from Brazil became widely known and consumers started to buy single-origin coffees from 
the country (Chaddad & Jank 2006). To this period of time, Brazil continues to produce 30-40% of the world's coffee 
supply. Recently, in 2020, Brazil provided 63,4 million 60-kg bags which accounts for 37% of total world production 
whereas Indonesia contributed merely 7%, supplying 11,95 million 60-kg bags (International Trade Center (ITC), 
2021). 
 
Based on those numbers, Indonesia is left behind compared to Brazil. The gap that stands in between the Indonesian 
and Brazilian coffee productivity is very pronounced, hence Indonesia still needs to learn from Brazil on how to 
develop and improve its coffee industry in the future. Therefore, this research explores the factors that set two countries 
apart and shows some areas that could be useful as industry solutions for Indonesia. There are two reasons why this

production system choices, innovation, and improvements as well as in the identification of fundamental flaws and 
the provision of remedies from the government. Finally, this research is anticipated to add to existing information, 
particularly concerning the coffee industry's competitive advantages and ways for improving them.

Abstract 
 
Healthcare is an essential service to everyone and as such, it is important that the policies and systems which are 
implemented in this area be adequate and flexible. Several issues have been raised concerning the capability of modern 
healthcare information systems in terms of the privacy, security, and availability of the data which it holds. MetaMed 
is a web application which seeks to remedy the problems of modern healthcare information systems through the 
provision of a different backend implementing by using blockchain technology. The objective of this paper was to 
analyze MetaMed using multiple analytical tools and methodologies to develop potential improvements for the 
product. A survey is deployed for such purposes. It consists of questions from varying perspectives which are 
constructed using the six thinking hats methodology. Once the survey results are ready, a SWOT analysis which 
analyzed the product’s internal and external factors was conducted. Finally, a TOWS matrix analysis referenced the 
findings of the SWOT analysis to develop strategies to capitalize on the product’s advantages and mitigate its 
weaknesses. Conclusively, results were produced through these analytical tools and methods supplying potential 
improvements on the product’s features, interface, functionalities, and deployment.

1. Introduction 
Healthcare is essential in prolonging human life and enabling individuals to achieve their tasks and goals. Normally, 
people visit healthcare facilities to check their health or undergo certain operations. During such visits, medical data 
is gathered and collectively, through the millions who are serviced by healthcare, a large volume of medical data is 
stored and analyzed. This health-related information is either collected with regular patient care (e.g., inpatient and 
outpatient care) or through a clinical trial program (Cheprasov 2017). Medical data is an important resource for 
healthcare organizations, especially for the purposes of medical research. Developments in the healthcare sector are 
driven by medical research and as such requires medical data for its input. Conclusively, by obtaining an abundance 
of medical data, more developments could be made possible for healthcare systems (e.g., safer operations, new 
medicine/devices, personalized treatment, etc.) (NEJM Catalyst 2018). 
 
Hospitals are responsible for many critical health scenarios, which is why it requires adequate medical systems 
accompanied by the assistance of trained healthcare professionals such as nurses and doctors with capable facilities 
and equipment. For the purposes of delivering healthcare services, medical records are provided for patients, doctors, 
and nurses. These records are essential for it holds information about past and present afflictions which determines 
the complications of a patient’s health. Additionally, it serves as a proof of evaluation for previous operations 
conducted by the medical staff (Gree 2021). According to a healthcare personnel at Makati Medical Center, healthcare 
professionals request for certain portions of a patient’s EHR to assist them in diagnosing patients, particularly if they 
were transferred from another hospital. The process in requesting for such mainly consists of communicating with the 
other hospital through online platforms which either has a long process or consume a substantial amount of time.

O8: People are open 
to the idea of selling 
data for the purpose 
of enhancing 
healthcare in a

Threats 
T1: People are 
generally cautious in 
sharing their data 
when they receive 
benefits in return. 
 
T2: Concerns on 
inconsistent 
profitability of the 
product. 
 
T3: The concept of

may raise suspicions 
and distrust with the 
product. 
 
T4: Incentives should 
be much more 
besides from the 
medical and long-
term monetization. 
ST Strategies 
S3S6T1T3: Improving the integrity of the 
product by having a feature wherein users 
can see the list of research institutes which 
have access to their anonymized data. 
 
S7S8T4: Strengthening the incentives and 
long-term benefits are not the only primary 
factors to consider. Consistency should be 
applied. The rewards and benefits should 
always stay the same for the following years 
to help maintain that ""consistency"". Special 
Incentives are added for those who will be 
using the product and be marked as a Loyal 
Customer. Giving people a reason to stay. 
While providing the same quality of medical 
care for their patients in the long run. 
 
S1T2: Implement a scheduled sharing period 
where users share their data for a set amount 
of time, but they are rid of the ability to 
restrict access to their data until the set time 
is reached. In return, they are provided 
slightly more benefits than the normal user. 
This allows for consistency in the data pool 
which is the leverage of the product in its 
profitability. 
WT Strategies 
W5T2: Implement a feature which 
restricts users from sharing their data 
until they provide proper verification for 
their identities. Only one account is 
permitted for each verified user. This 
reduces the possibility of abuse in the 
system as duplicate accounts or fake 
accounts cannot be utilized to produce 
patient data of a nonexistent person. 
 
W5T2: To help appeal to the people. 
Apply marketing through digital media to 
expand upon the exposure of making the 
product stand out and recognized. 
Expanding the market to advertisements 
and digital media would help generate 
profits and knowing what the customer 
needs with the product. 
 
W8T3: It is with utmost discretion that 
the contract agreement will be strictly 
followed. Not as an option but as 
mandated by the purpose of 
confidentiality and following proper 
digital laws. If the company were to 
break the promise of protecting personal 
data. Then the customer may choose to 
file charges as long as evidence show 
proof of breaking contract. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The objectives of this paper were to analyze the product, MetaMed, to bring forward potential improvements. A survey 
was constructed using the six thinking hats and was distributed to respondents accordingly to the product’s target 
users. The survey consisted of 21 questions in total from 6 varying perspectives which were aimed to evaluate the 
product. After a few weeks, the survey gathered 50 responses overall. The results taken from the responses of this 
survey were used for the SWOT analysis which followed. The SWOT analysis evaluated the various factors 
concerning the product such as the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Strengths and weaknesses are 
internal factors while opportunities and threats are external factors to the product. Afterwards, the resulting set of 
factors from the SWOT analysis are referenced by the TOWS analysis matrix to develop strategies in emphasizing the

Abstract 
 
Transitioning to renewable energy requires a micro approach at the household level as decision-makers. This paper 
investigates the characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) system adopters and non-adopters of photovoltaic (PV) systems 
in Indonesian households to recognize household heterogeneity and explores empirical facts regarding the critical 
factors influencing PV system adoption. A survey of 450 households was conducted in 2020. The results showed that 
the adopter and non-adopter groups differed significantly in their activeness in seeking information about PV and the 
recommendations received for using PV. However, the effect of suggestions and sources of information was the same 
between the two groups. Both groups have the same perception of the benefits derived from PV systems and the high 
investment costs. However, they are significantly different in perceptions of the complexity of using PV systems. The 
research shows that the adopter group is an early adopter, while the non-adopter group has late adopter characteristics. 
Regarding environmental value, the two groups did not show a significant difference concerning the problem of 
awareness and responsibility for using renewable energy. However, they differed in willingness to pay more for using 
renewable energy. Electricity bill reduction, energy independence, and environmental friendliness are the three 
primary motivators for adopting groups to install PV systems. Meanwhile, in the non-adopter group, high installation 
costs, access to installation services, and lack of information were encountered as the main obstacles to adoption. The 
non-adopter group will be willing to use the PV system if given a 55% subsidy of the investment cost and when the 
payback period is not more than 8 years.

1. Introduction 
Population growth and increased economic activity led to higher electricity demand. Currently, the electrical energy 
supply depends on fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and gas. The electricity supply faces environmental issues such as 
increased greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and the depletion of fossil resources. The transition to renewable 
energy sources is a must in electricity supply. The Indonesian government is targeting the provision of 45.2 GW of 
sustainable electricity to support the achievement of the target of 23% renewable energy in the national energy mix 
by 2025 (MEMR, 2021a). As alternative energy with matured technology and abundant sources in Indonesia, solar 
power is expected to contribute 6.5GW through photovoltaic (PV) technology (MEMR, 2021a). Given the modular 
nature of PV technology, the Indonesian government is pushing for rooftop PV applications and is targeting 1.5GW 
of electricity generated from this program. PV systems make households act as prosumers who consume electricity 
from the grid and can generate their electricity (Nugraha et al., 2020). In several studies, the presence of prosumers 
has proven to be a solution for providing sustainable energy (Kumar and Saha, 2015; Sato, 2016). 
 
The Indonesian government regulates PV use through Ministerial Regulation Number 49 of 2018, issued by the 
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR). This regulation allows PV adopters to send their excess PV

1978",,"Referring to Rogers’ adopter classification, the adopter group is dominated by early adopters; on the other hand, the 
non-adopter group follows the late majority criteria. Both groups have the same awareness of environmental problems 
and the responsibility to use RE. However, both groups differed significantly in their willingness to pay more to use 
RE, whereas the adopter group had a higher willingness. Regarding the perception of PV systems attributes, both 
groups have the same perception that PV systems provide environmental, financial, and social benefits. Both groups 
also agree that PV systems are expensive. However, the non-adopter group has more perceptions regarding the 
complexity of using PV systems. This finding indicates that the perception of the non-adopter group that the PV 
system is challenging to install and use is one of the obstacles to adoption. Here, the role of the PV industry is needed 
to provide explanations for non-adopters to reduce the perception of complexity. 
 
The results show that the desire to reduce electricity bills, energy independence, and environmental friendliness are 
the three primary motivators for the adopter group to install a PV system. Meanwhile, non-adopter perceived barriers 
to adopting PV systems are the high investment cost, demanding access to PV system installation service providers, 
and lack of information. In addition, this research found that the financial facilitation expected by non-adopters to 
adopt PV, namely the existence of a minimum subsidy of 55% and an investment payback period of not more than 
eight years. Interesting findings on the expected value of PV electricity export tariffs to the PLN network. Non-
adopters expect export tariffs of 64%, slightly below the current value of 65%. Although the current export tariffs 
have met the non-adopters expectations,  they have not yet adopted the PV system. There may be two reasons: 
investment costs that are still too high as an obstacle to adoption, without any financial support (including subsidies 
or grants). And the second reason is the lack of information so that the non-adopter groups do not understand the 
current export tariffs and the calculation mechanism. For this reason, more intensive socialization is needed. 
 
The adoption of PV systems faces financial and technical challenges and the availability of information. This study 
helps policymakers understand the drivers of adoption decisions and the barriers that hinder non-adoption. The 
expected financial and technical facilitation by non-adopters will enable policymakers to design appropriate policies 
to support the development of the PV systems market.

Abstract 
 
Product design quality urgently needs to be defined and expressed by the designer in the overall design process.  
Previous research has implemented House of Quality (HOQ) or Quality Function Deployment (QFD) in determining 
design requirements, such as: assessment of design and development processes, even analyzing design quality 
priorities with fuzzy analytic network approach and integrating house of quality with objective engineering models 
with product performance. Complement prior studies, this research aims to implement the House of Quality in 
determining design requirements in accordance with customer voice and then integrating them with analytic network 
process (ANP) approaches combined with decision making trial and evaluation laboratory. (DEMATEL) in 
prioritizing design requirements. This research will implement the integration of the HOQ method with multi criteria 
decision making (ANP & DEMATEL) in the multifunction bag for bicycle design process through three processes 
consisting of: identification of problems in bicycle sports lovers, ideation and augmented house of quality method, 
and design concept. Through the application of HOQ integrated with MCDM in this case study, designer could manage 
the quality in every stage of design process.

Abstract 
 
Wearable industry shipment and use prediction is increasing until 2026, especially smartwatches. In this pandemic 
phenomenon, smartwatches have become more critical because they can monitor fitness activities and rest in 
detail. In addition, the technology contained in the smartwatch must also be considered. The advanced technology 
available may make some users feel discomfort and insecure. This study is formed to consider the technology 
readiness index (TRI) such as optimism, innovativeness, insecurity, and discomfort in the technology acceptance 
model (TAM) towards user acceptance in using their smartwatch. 192 respondents filled out an online survey and 
then tested it using the PLS-SEM method. The result showed from 12 hypotheses that three hypotheses have no 
significant impact. Insecurity has no significant impact on perceived ease of use and usefulness, with the p-value 
0,082 and 0,467. Optimism also has no significant impact on influencing perceived usefulness, with a p-value 
0,220.

1. Introduction 
Wearable devices have become one of the most popular technologies like advanced information and 
communication technology (ICT). The global smart wearable industry has been growing for several quarters, but 
in Q4 2020, a significant shift in the smart band/smartwatch dynamic occurred. Even though the pandemic has 
sparked interest in health and fitness tracking, wrist-worn wearables such as watches and wristbands encountered 
hurdles during the quarter due to supply restrictions and shifting demand. But smartwatch selling succeeded as a 
critical growth engine (Chen and Low 2021).  
 
Total shipments rose 5.6 percent year over year in Q2 2021. On the other hand, smart band sales fell 23.8 percent 
(Lim 2021). The growth of full-fledged smartwatches, which climbed by 37.9 percent year over year and now 
account for 62 percent of global sales, somewhat offset the decline of the smart band. In the Q3 of 2021, 
smartwatches' shipments keep rising at about 16 percent compared to the same quarter the previous year. 
According to a market research study, the global wearable technology market is predicted to rise at a compound 
annual growth rate of 22,5 percent between 2021 and 2026 (Mehra 2021). 
 
Until the end of 2016, smartwatch adoption is still in the early adopter stage because people who purchase and 
own smartwatches are often those with a high enough income to justify the technology's cost, or those who are 
already conscious of the necessity of preserving health and comprehending technology. Another point to consider 
is that to reap the benefits, the users must engage in intensive or long-term use (Moore 2021). 
 
On the other hand, the adoption of smartwatches is still being assessed. The technology acceptance model (TAM) 
is a fundamental theory that uses two ideas to explore end-user acceptance or adoption of technology: perceived 
usefulness and perceived ease of use. The technology readiness index (TRI) also undoubtedly plays a role as an 
external element in technology acceptance on smartwatch use. TRI component extends the TAM theory in the 
new technology acceptance. 
 
The primary purpose of this study is to investigate consumers' acceptance of smartwatch use in Indonesia. This 
study uses the TAM theory, which is well-suited to the setting of smartwatches, to look at customers' intentions 
to utilize them. This study also examines the role of the TRI’s variables in the acceptance of smartwatch use. The 
study's findings may then be used to reflect smartwatch brands' awareness of and development of technologies 
integrated with smartwatches in Indonesia.

5.3 Model Fit Measurement 
In SmartPLS, there are two types of model fit measurement results: saturated model and estimated model. The 
saturated model evaluates the correlation between all variables in the model fit test, whereas the estimated model 
is based on the total or overall effect scheme. If the SRMR number, or Standardized Root Mean Square Residual, 
is less than 0.1, the model is deemed to fit the suggested model (Hair et al. 2018, Hu and Bentler 1998, Hooper et 
al. 2008). Because the SRMR value is less than 0.1, the model fit of the suggested model appears to be pretty 
excellent and acceptable. The fit model may also be examined using the Normed Fit Index (NFI) value in addition 
to the SRMR value. NFI values vary from 0 to 1, with 0 being the lowest and 1 being the highest. The SRMR and 
NFI values in the research model are listed in Table 9.

6. Conclusion 
The user intention in Indonesia to utilize the smartwatch was assessed using an extension of the technology 
acceptance model that included optimism, innovativeness, insecurity, and discomfort. The results showed if 
insecurity has no significant impact on perceived ease of use and usefulness. Some issues that became the 
statements of discomfort and insecurity are the big problem for using the smartwatch. Also, the optimism result 
showed that optimism has no significant impact on perceived usefulness. In addition, the technology readiness 
index entirely plays a role in smartwatch use in Indonesia. 
 
Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) theory, if users feel it is easy to operate the technology, users 
will receive the benefits so that they decide to adopt the technology longer than when they used it when this 
research was implemented. With a very high path coefficient, users will continue to use their smartwatch in the 
future based on the existing attitude during use.

Abstract 
Changes in lifestyle during the pandemic affect people's purchasing power and habits towards the need for baby food, 
especially dairy products, so that increasing profits and business competitiveness becomes an important part for 
companies which are engaged in procuring powdered milk for toddlers. One of the strategies to increase profitability 
and competitiveness is to increase customer retention by predicting customer loyalty and classifying customer profiles 
in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) which is often also known as the Customer Loyalty Program. This 
discussion tries to classify customer loyalty through customer profiles (demography, transactions, etc.) using 
techniques from data mining methods. Beforehand, to classify the loyal and non-loyal customers as the objective of 
customer loyalty program, this study used cluster analysis to map the customers based on their behavior recorded in 
the transactions they made and the information they provided. The objective of this study is to answer several questions 
such as: is the predicted performance value of loyal customers accurate? And what variables are most important in 
classifying loyal customers? In addition, this study also aims to understand the use of data mining methods and how 
to interpret the results of the techniques that have been used. The dataset contains 655,625 observations and 20 
variables while for cluster analysis, there are only 7 variables are being used whereby using this method, the optimal 
clusters obtained are 3 clusters. With the new labels for targeted variable, labels 0 and 1 are labeled as non-loyal 
customer and label 3 is the loyal customer where the proportion of each label are 76%, 15.18% and 8.82% then the 
proportion of non-loyal and loyal customers are 91.18% and 8.82%. Using logistic regression method to classify loyal 
and non-loyal customers, the result showed that the model accuracy is about 96.6% where the misclassification error 
for the model is 3.4%. With this accuracy value, it can be recommended that this model can be used to classify 
customers in the customer loyalty program based on the dataset and variables that build the model.

1. Introduction 
The covid 19 pandemic that occurred in 2019 until now, has resulted in changes in the lifestyle for the world 
community which also occurred in Indonesia, especially in the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta. As the capital city of 
Indonesia, Jakarta is famous for its dense activities with high mobility and fast movement which later changed due to 
the pandemic that hit the city. The high mobility and fast movement lifestyle shifted into stay-at-home lifestyle is 
clearly seen in activities such as studying from home, working from home, and eliminating celebrations that require 
large crowds such as weddings, birthdays, or other social activities. Lifestyle changes during the pandemic also 
affected people's purchasing power and habits towards the need for baby food, especially dairy products, thus 
increasing profits and business competitiveness becomes an important part of the companies in this industry where 
one of the strategies developed is to build relationship with the customers. 
 
When the world is experiencing a change in the purchasing power of its people, market predictions in Indonesia will 
always experience growth for dairy products and their derivatives. Thus, to meet ever-increasing market demands, 
companies need to improve quality and quantity so that customer satisfaction can be achieved. Customer satisfaction 
is one of the important factors in increasing customer retention, which is the goal of the customer loyalty program 
which will then be discussed in this study. An integrated model for classifying loyal customer using data mining 
techniques such as cluster and classification, is a topic that will be discussed in this study, namely K-Means and 
Logistic Regression models that will be used to explore the variables that build customer behavior. Moreover, this

2000","Figure 7. Misclassification Error – Test Dataset 
With a consistent Misclassification error value in the training dataset and test dataset, which is around 3.4%, it can be 
said that the model used is consistent with an accuracy of 96.6% (figure 7). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Loyal and non-loyal customers as seen in the model will affect several variables that make up, while the model does 
not affect several variables such as: month_2 (number of transactions in the second month), gram2 (total grams in the 
second month of transactions), is_product_2 and is_product_4 (stating the last registered product is product 2 and 
product 4) as well as the gender variable, either female or male. As a step to increase loyal customer the interval 
redeem variable (the time interval between the first date of redeeming the voucher and the last date of redeeming the 
voucher) was added and as shown in the classification model, this variable has a tendency to affect loyal or non-loyal 
customers with a slope value of 3.31e- 11. The Logistic Regression Model used is a Binomial Logistic Regression 
Model where the label variables used are binary variables 1 and 0 (Loyal and Non-loyal), As for classifying with label 
variables that have more than 2 categories, we will use the Multinomial Logistic Regression Model.

Abstract 
 
In an effort to overcome environmental issues related to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, Indonesia is one of the 
countries that has committed to supporting the use of electric vehicles to replace internal combustion vehicles. The 
potential increase in the use of electric vehicles creates a large potential for the generation of electric vehicles to reach 
the end of life (EoL). This EoL electric vehicle can pollute the environment if released into the environment. It will 
be very unfortunate if this consumable electric vehicle is left alone and becomes garbage even though it contains a 
limited number of metals. Therefore, a circular supply chain (CSC) system is needed in Indonesia to reduce waste in 
the form of EoL electric vehicles and reduce the need for raw materials for the manufacture of electric vehicles 
considering that the materials used are non-renewable. This research presents a conceptual model of the influential 
factors toward the CSC implementation of electric vehicles in Indonesia. The model was developed based on literature 
review and secondary sources analyses to capture both the difference between CSC in Indonesia and in developed 
countries based on the role of the informal sector in handling products that reach the EOL. The informal sector is 
usually small in scale and uses simple technology. This means the recycling process carried out will result in greater 
pollution than using standard methods with adequate technology. This causes the CSC system in Indonesia to produce 
greater pollution than in developed countries, considering that the role of the informal sector cannot be eliminated in 
Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
Ergonomic design on a computer mouse is very important to prevent injury in the arm called mouse elbow. Mouse 
elbow injury is a minor injury that occurs due to a hand position error when using a computer mouse. Musculoskeletal 
Disorder (MSD) is experienced by workers who interact with computers intensively where fifty percent of mouse 
users experience MSD. Studies show that mouse use can cause several injuries such as: Carpal Tunner Syndrome and 
other MSDs. Designated injury is caused by the bending position of the wrist with a radical angle coupled with the 
overall movement of the fingers during the operation of the computer mouse.  This research aims to design an 
ergonomic computer mouse by considering the MSD injury factor so that computer mouse users can anticipate the 
occurrence of MSD. The principle of Anthropometry parallel to design thinking became the method used in this 
research. The results of this research are in the form of mouse design concepts that can accommodate the prevention 
of Mouse elbow injury. The contribution of this research is exploring the optimal degree of freedom on elbow during 
the movement of using mouse computer.

Abstract 
 
Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises are critical to a country's economic growth (MSMEs). Nevertheless, the 
Covid-19 pandemic affected a wide variety of business sectors. As a result, MSME entrepreneurs must develop a 
strategy or plan for conducting business. One strategy that MSME entrepreneurs can employ is to calculate life cycle 
costs to use them as a factor in future decision-making, as they are already aware of the processing costs. Thus, it is 
hoped that MSME entrepreneurs will avoid closing their businesses due to uncontrollable obstacles. This study aims 
to calculate the life cycle costs of MSME food entrepreneurs by analyzing the flow of expenditure and revenue 
associated with operating the production machines used. By utilizing tofu producers in three different locations 
throughout Indonesia, namely Bekasi, Cikampek, and Karawang, this research will examine three machines: the 
soybean grinding machine, the water steam generation machine, and the water pump machine. Following a literature 
review, it is determined that the machine's best life cycle cost will be the one with the lowest Equivalent Annual Cost 
(EAC). The best life cycle cost calculation was obtained for the soybean grinding machine in Cikampek, with an EAC 
of IDR 20,665,699, -, for the water steam generation machine in Cikampek, with an EAC of IDR 97,153,664,-, and 
for the water pump machine in Cikampek, with an EAC of IDR 12,474,880,-. It can be seen that the wages for 
operating the same machine in different locations affect the choice of the best life cycle cost.

1. Introduction 
The existence of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs), particularly in developing countries, is a 
pillar of economic growth. MSMEs play a critical role in economic development (Bongomin et al. 2017). Is evidenced 
by the data on the number of MSMEs in Indonesia, which consistently increases year after year (BPS 2020). According 
to the Ministry of Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises (2019), MSMEs employ 96.92 percent (119.6 million 
people) of the total workforce in Indonesia, compared to large businesses, which employ 3.08 percent of the total 
workforce in Indonesia, with the highest absorption in the micro-enterprise.  
 
Additionally, given their significant contribution to the country's GDP, it is easy to see why MSMEs are economic 
pillars. At constant prices, MSMEs contributed IDR 7,034.1 trillion to GDP in 2019, up 22.9 percent from IDR 5,721.1 
trillion in 2018. Meanwhile, at current prices, MSMEs contribute IDR 9,580.8 trillion to GDP. This contribution 
increased by 5.7 percent over the previous year's IDR 9,062.6 trillion (Ministry of Cooperatives, Small and Medium 
Enterprises 2021). According to BPS data (2015), food and beverage processing accounts for 44.9 percent of 
Indonesia's 3.4 million MSMEs. 
 
On the other hand, numerous business sectors have been affected by the current Covid-19 pandemic. The most 
significant income decline in the business sector was food or beverage accommodation, at nearly 92.47 percent (BPS 
2020). Additionally, 4.28 percent of IMK was closed in the first quarter of 2020, according to BPS (2020) data. It then 
increased to 5.43 percent in the second quarter of 2020 and continued to increase by 6.03 percent in the third quarter 
of 2020. The closed IMK reached 7.06 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 
However, the tofu manufacturing industry data indicate that consumption of tofu has increased throughout the current 
pandemic. The average weekly consumption of tofu per capita in 2021, according to BPS data (2021), is 0.158 kg. On

The water pump machine in Cikampek was chosen because it has low initial, low worker salaries, and low routine 
maintenance costs, resulting in low annual maintenance costs. As a result, the machine's NPV and EAC values are 
reduced. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The life cycle cost method is beneficial for determining a business's expenses and revenue. Financial flows are 
extremely sensitive for MSMEs, which can still be said to have a limited number of calculation elements and a small 
profit margin. Primarily to maintain or replace the machine in use, MSMEs can use this life cycle cost calculation to 
determine which costs can be reduced in a future crisis. According to this research, when three different locations are 
considered, namely Bekasi, Cikampek, and Karawang, the resulting life cycle cost calculation varies even when the 
same machine is used.  
 
The best life cycle cost calculation was obtained for the soybean grinding machine in Cikampek, which had an EAC 
of IDR 20,665,699, -, the water steam generation machine in Cikampek, which had an EAC of IDR 97,153,664,-, and 
the water pump machine in Cikampek, which had an EAC of IDR 12,474,880,-. As can be seen, wages for operating 
the same machine in different locations affect the best life cycle cost selection.

1. Introduction  
The Covid-19 pandemic has had many impacts on various sectors, especially the economic sector. In Indonesia, the 
Central Statistics Agency (BPS) stated that Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) was minus 2.07 percent in 
2020. This decline in GDP was caused by limited economic activity due to the Covid-19 pandemic (Kemenkeu.go.id, 
2021). The International Labor Organization (ILO) conducted a survey on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on 
571 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the survey results showed that 70% of MSMEs experienced 
production stops due to the Covid-19 pandemic (Katadata.id, 2020). The Minister of Cooperatives and MSMEs 
stated that the Covid-19 pandemic had a major impact on the sustainability of MSMEs (bisnis.com, 2022). To 
overcome the problem of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government imposed a new normal, the World Health 
Organization WHO has also provided a scenario for implementing a new normal in the midst of the Covid-19 
pandemic (Nur'aeni & Khoeriah, 2019). According to (Nuramdani, 2020) the new normal is an effort to prepare to 
be able to do activities outside the home optimally, therefore the community must be able to adapt in undergoing 
new behavior changes, this lifestyle change must of course be carried out together by implementing health protocols 
as a form of prevention. the spread and spread of Covid-19. Entrepreneurs need adaptation in order to survive in the 
new normal of the Covid 19 pandemic. The new normal requires businesspeople to change their way of doing 
business from conventional to online, business in the pandemic era and the new normal will be successful if it is 
based on optimizing technology (Widyamataram, 2020). 
 
The rapid development of technology in recent years has had an impact on various sectors, including the 
entrepreneurial sector. During this Covid-19 pandemic, business actors need to take advantage of existing 
technology to run and develop their business, such as adopting e-commerce (Arianto, 2020). The quality and quantity 
of entrepreneurs soared along with the ease of accessing the internet. Many business actors who initially sold with 
conventional systems, are now starting to switch online (Maulidasari & Damrus, 2020). According to BPS data, 
71.18 percent of 16,227 e-commerce businesses have made sales via the internet in the period 2017 to 2020, while 
26.90 percent have started selling online from 2010 to 2016 and 1.92 percent of businesses have started selling. 
online before 2010 (BPS, 2020). The current digital era encourages entrepreneurial activities to open obstacles easily 
through the various advantages and conveniences that are obtained. The Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and 
Medium Enterprises (Kemenkop UKM) in 2017 launched as many as 3.79 million micro, small and medium 
enterprises that have used online platforms to market their products. This number is around 8 percent of the total

Abstract 
 
Studies present insufficient information on working models within the purchasing area using the BPM tool for agro-
industrial companies, especially in Latin America, which aim to improve performance and optimize the processes of 
an organization. For this reason, the need for this research arises. This scientific article presents a model to improve 
supply management. The BPM methodology was proposed to standardize internal processes and the Kraljic matrix, a 
tool used in purchasing management to classify materials and optimize purchase planning. The level of compliance 
within the purchasing area did not satisfy the established policies, reaching only 55.96% and generating a gap in the 
savings goal of approximately S/.500,000. This causes an imbalance at the administrative and operational level due to 
a lack of general standardization of the processes. This triggered problems at the macro level, such as lack of 
communication between areas, inefficient operations, and economic losses. The proposal that was carried out covers 
different areas, such as a harmonization within the administrative processes to reduce time variability and logistics 
focused on the efficient management of purchases and classification of materials. It was possible to prove the 
hypothesis; it is feasible to reach 85% of the target scope by restructuring the areas and generating strategies. The 
simulation could prove the optimization of resources by up to 60% and reduce processing times.

1. Introduction  
Peru has positioned itself as the leader in blueberry exports worldwide, thanks to an exponential production growth 
on its coast. Peru increased its blueberry exports by 27.5%, to 155,600 tons, widening the gap with Chile. (EAST 
FRUIT, 2021). However, past studies reveal that companies put all their focus on production but then lose profitability 
by selling poorly (marketing) or paying dearly for inputs, labor, or rents (cost efficiency). That is why purchasing 
management aims at acquiring the goods and services that the company needs, ensuring the supply of the required 
quantities in terms of time, quality, and price. However, the entity's supply chain must be well-identified to achieve 
efficient purchasing management. (Universidad Nacional de Luján, 2014). 
 
According to the literature, the problem may be due to different factors, as is the case of an agro-industrial company 
in northern Peru, where purchasing management is not measurable; data on purchase orders and items generated, 
service times, or values for purchases, among others, are not analyzed. (Ochoa et al., 2017) Likewise, a problem that 
could be evidenced is the waste of economies of scale, which results in the loss of opportunity to save up to 15% of 
its expenses and at the same time incurring excess transportation costs since orders are issued separately, thus 
generating a freight cost for each one. (Benites et al. 2020). This can lead to cost overruns, overruns, and poor-quality 
work. The same problem was also reflected in another case study, which showed that reducing the time and procedures 
in the procurement process made it possible to save approximately S/. 450,000. (Gohin, F. C. and Linares, 2014).

2024",,"Finally, the savings target is achievable based on the fulfillment of different strategies, which are affected by the 
management of tenders and the parameters established in such tenders. The hiring of operational support personnel 
was taken as an observation, which is focused on working and transactional tasks related to the server so that the 
functions of the other workers can be optimized. The research may be replicable in other sectors since it focuses on 
restructuring operational and automated jobs to optimize different areas simultaneously and reduce reprocesses.

Abstract 
Managing a lot of data using a well-designed health information system can prevent medical errors and support doctors 
and medical service providers in providing the proper diagnosis to patients. This condition is inseparable from 
advances in data exchange technology commonly used, namely REST and SOAP. The REST API is beneficial in 
exchanging medical record data faster in real-time. Problems then arise as time goes by, where transactions 
significantly increase, creating a longer access time. This study solves the problem by adding design pattern 
technology using a caching pattern. The data retrieval process on the web service is stored in the cache so that when 
retrieving data, there is no need to re-query the database and then update the cache on the web service and update 
daily using Cron. This research uses a case study of a healthcare business intelligence system with various data taken 
from 3 different systems that have been integrated. Tests were carried out in on-premise and cloud server environments 
with variations between 5,000 and 10,000 data and tested 50 times each. After using the catching pattern, the 
measurement results of on-premise web services show a reduction in response time of up to 87%. For further 
development, an additional service is needed to manage caches that are simultaneously entered into the server so that 
RAM usage occurs optimally and does not cause data access time delays.

1. Introduction 
The health industry is currently one aspect of life that continues to change and develop following technological 
advances that continue to grow until now (Hamson et al. 2021)(Erdal 2018). Digital health services provide 
convenience and benefits to increase their efficiency (Almotawkel et al. 2021) in the area of managing patient medical 
record data, hospital records, and health examination results (Dash et al. 2019)(Andreu-Perez et al. 2015). In a study 
conducted by Leila Ismail et al. in 2020 on eHealth, the research results show that managing many data using a well-
designed health information system can prevent medical errors. Supporting medical service providers in providing 
proper diagnoses to patients and improving the quality of data access in real-time is the main thing in the health data 
management system. It can reduce medical incidents due to delays in data updates by doctors (Ismail et al. 2020). The 
study found that health data was evolved using a client-server-based data management system that allows doctors to 
access and update patient medical records in real-time.

2036","Figure 10. Rest-API access speed improvement (after using a caching pattern) 
 
This situation appeared due to bottlenecks when downloading data to be retrieved. The downloading of requested data 
is not reduced much when it has or has not used caching patterns. The download time at the time of request data can 
be seen in figure 11. 
 
 
 
Figure 11. Description of rest API access time before and after using caching pattern 
 
The access time before using the caching pattern requires a transfer request time of 1629.69 ms, and the time used to 
download data is 200.17 ms. After using the caching pattern, the transfer request time became 147.07 ms, and the time 
used to download data did not change significantly, around 195.01 ms. From this, it can be seen that the use of caching 
patterns affects the request and response time, not the download time, and internet speed will affect the time of request 
data from the rest API. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This research aims to increase the speed of web service access by using design patterns in the health intelligence 
business. We have presented a caching design pattern approach on the rest server. The data used is data related to 
health, such as health complaint data, medical expenses, and employees. Any query data from the database is entered 
in the cache on the rest server. The database in this study is stored on the MongoDB database system. Caching patterns 
have weaknesses, such as the expiration of data that has to be updated. This study performed data updates on the cache 
using cron jobs that will be triggered automatically every time specified. Rest API are stored on cloud services with 
two processor cores and 4 GB of ram. Measurements were made on the client-side with a download speed of 20Mb / 
s and an upload speed of 5Mb / s. The results of the rest API measurement made with requests of 50 times and different 
amounts of data showed an increase in access speed of up to 87%. The speed of access rest API in the cache only 
increases in the request and response process, not the download speed. The result leads to a decrease in the speed of 
rest API access as the size of the data increases. This research proves the acceleration of access time after using 
caching patterns in rest APIs, which is very useful in intelligence business systems that use a lot of data. Suggestions 
for further development: An additional service is needed to manage the cache that enters simultaneously into the server 
so that the use of ram does not cause slow data access time lag.

a country's achievements in healthy living, knowledge, and living standard. This article investigates the HDI in Indian 
states and union territories and the factors that influence inter-state comparisons in economic well-being, health, 
education, and the human development index. The relationships between social opportunities and HDI status in Indian 
states have been calculated using correlation.

1. Introduction  
The human capital theory focuses on the individual's education and health to foster economic production; it deals with 
acquiring skills, experience, and knowledge essential for the Country's growth (Adelakun, 2011). Formative literature 
on HDI suggests that education is critical to economic growth. Adam Smith et al.; Klenow and Rodriguez-Claire 
(1997), Hall and Jone (1997), and Easterly and Levine (2001) suggested that disparity in educational status is the 
primary source of inequality among a country's inhabitants. Abramovitz (1989, 1990), Romer, P. (1989, 1990), and

and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022

2046","disparities are likely to add another layer of complexity to this result, but they are outside the scope of this research 
and can be investigated independently. 
 
The HDI, calculated using global goalposts, categorizes ten states as medium human development states and nine as 
poor ones; disparities cause an average loss of 28 percent in medium human development states, whereas inequalities 
cause a 33 percent loss in low human development states. This implies that an examination of the impact of disparities 
at a disaggregated level finds that disparities in the education component are the greatest, consistent with the HDR 
findings. It asks for a specific emphasis on locations and socioeconomic groups that continue to suffer barriers to 
education.  
 
Accordingly, healthcare disparities are also widespread: many studies have found significant healthcare access and 
usage variations. People's achievement in both education and health is poor, and the level of inequality is substantial. 
More study is needed to investigate the interconnections between inequality across domains and dimensions and 
investigate the causes of these inequities. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The HDI for India rose from 0.579 in 2010 to 0.645 in 2019. (UNDP Human Development Report, 2020) India's 
position in the Human Development Index (HDI) was 131 in 2019, up from 129 in 2018.; a two-point drop in HDI 
worldwide ranking in 2019 compared to 2018. In the sub-component performance of HDI, India's 'GNI per capita 
(2017 PPP $)' climbed from US$ 6,427 in 2018 to US$ 6,681 in 2019, while 'life expectancy at birth' increased from 
69.4 years in 2018 to 69.7 years in 2019. The mean years of schooling and 'anticipated years of schooling,' on the 
other hand, remained unchanged in 2019 compared to 2018. India was ranked eight times higher than HDI for the 
Planetary Pressures Adjusted HD (PHDI) value. If a country does not exert any pressure on the earth, its PHDI and 
HDI are equal, but the PHDI falls below the HDI as pressure increases. PHDI levels are extremely near to HDI values 
in nations with HDI values of 0.7 or below. The average annual HDI growth rate from 2010 to 2019 was 1.21 percent, 
compared to 1.58 percent from 2000 to 2010.

Abstract  
 
As Oceans cover approximately 72% of the Earth's surface, it is imperative to extend the Internet of Things (IoT) 
principles to the existing bodies, paving the way for a new digital trend: the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). 
The IoUT refers to the worldwide network of smart interconnected underwater objects, which enhances monitoring 
unexplored and vast water areas. It enables various applications like environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, 
and underground exploration. The Internet of Underground things with such applications is among the leading applied 
technologies in smart cities. This paper aims to focus specifically on determining the potential applications of the 
IoUT applications, which can help in examining the challenges that are and will be faced during its modeling and 
implementation. The study aims to investigate the challenges of designing and implementing such a network. The 
research includes communication networks and MATLAB & Simulink simulation. Based on previous reviews, an 
optimal network of IoUT enhances the development and integration of various systems for the robust evaluation of 
water ecosystems. The study's outcomes include a tested AUV simulation model, which is a crucial part of an IoUT 
system that can be adjusted to suit local water conditions. The idea of IoUT should be embraced due to its positive 
impact on social and economic factors.

6. Conclusion 
A new class of IoT was investigated: the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). It has been proven that it is among 
the common technologies that will enhance the development of smart cities, which will help take the traditional 
communication systems to the next generation. Moreover, it helps society in preserving underwater natural resources. 
Despite the trend of this contemporary topic, only a few studies have been carried out concerning the topic; however, 
most have not addressed the efficiency and practicality of the system. AUVs play a critical part in the IoUT technology 
and the implementation of the Smart Ocean. There are, however, concerns and obstacles that must be handled initially. 
The majority of the problems are caused by several AUVs in a large-scale network which is potentially inefficient to 
maintain (unsustainable) because every element in the system is dependent on the other: the more elements, the wider 
the range of error.

Abstract 
 
COVID 19 Pandemic and its long global persistence created challenges in the United States and many countries 
worldwide. As reported by the media, academic education had been one of the major sectors of the community 
that the arrival of this pandemic has significantly impacted and became temporarily paralyzed due to the high 
speed of infection of the virus. Due to their access to the high-speed internet system, many academic campuses 
and k-12 institutions have adopted online instructions and learning processes using the available group 
communication software systems, including Zoom, WebEx, SKYPE, etc., as a viable alternative method in the 
absence of face-to-face instructional opportunities. Although many experts in online teaching have discussed the 
positive and negative features of online education methods through their articles, a small number of articles 
concentrated on student learning abilities based on their cultural backgrounds and locations. This article reports 
the outcomes of a study primarily focused on student learning in two undergraduate egineering courses in an 
institution in the United States and its international branch. The study further reports on some success achieved 
due to modifications in the content and delivery methods that might be necessary to make a practical and positive 
impact on these learners.

1. Introduction 
Over the past three decades, due to an increase in the standard of living of the general population in Qatar, the 
government’s vision has been to transform the country’s general economy from a fossil-based to a knowledge-
based economy. And the government provides college education to a more significant number of their population 
who otherwise would not pursue education in foreign countries became more prominent. Many countries located 
in the Middle East and North Africa (MINA area) have consistently expressed interest in getting young high 
school graduates to earn college degrees from Western universities (Retnanto et al., 2022; Retnanto et al., 2021; 
Retnanto et al., 2020). Several North American and European higher education institutions were invited to 
establish campuses in these countries to achieve this goal. Several countries, including Qatar, United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, and several others, have taken the initiative and established campuses in their 
homelands.

2064","4. Conclusion 
The results indicated that information technology (IT) knowledge played an important role in facilitating the 
remote or synchronous learning method and provided the Qatar campus students assigned a higher score for this 
element. The results also indicated that students were less respective to remote learning (synchronous) for the 
classes with laboratory components. The influence of a reliable high-speed internet system contributed to students’ 
ability to retrieve and connect with their instructors and classmates was pertinent. However, the questionnaire did 
not pose any questions regarding this issue as the uploading, and the downloading speed of the network was not 
under the control of either the academic institution or course instructors. It is also pertinent that the face-to-face 
instructions and having access to course instructors for theoretical courses were preferred as they could speed up 
the learning process.

Abstract 
 
Globally, Thailand have been one of the top 5 rice exporting countries and Thai rice is also known as fragrant rice. 
Over the past 5 years, Thailand have exported rice approximately 8.46 million tons per year to major export partners 
such as China, Japan, the United States, and the European Union. However, the patterns of Thailand’s rice exports 
quantity have illustrated the variation and instability which cause of inaccurate forecasts. The aim of this study is to 
propose the forecasting solutions by determining the significant trends and analyzing the affecting factors of 
Thailand’s rice exports. The proposed model explores 4 forecasting techniques including Backpropagation Neural 
Network (BPNN), Holt-Winters (HW), Multiple Regression (MR), and Exponential Smoothing (ES). Therefore, the 
results reveal that Backpropagation Neural Network is the optimal solution and data correlation is 0.87. The three 
impact factors are Interest rate, Exchange rate, and Tapioca price influencing Thai rice export significantly. Ultimately, 
the results of this study emphasize the importance of demand forecasting to estimate and predict consumers’ future 
demand with a purpose for making better-informed supply decisions as well as enhancing total system effectiveness 
of supply chain in the competitive market and unpredictable environment for the future of rice production and 
consumption.

applications and successful strategies.  Industry 4.0 technologies utilize data and successful applications must involve 
data collection and management, data analytics, and automation.  The value proposition of Industry 4.0 is in turning 
data into usable information in such a way as to improve business results.  Review of case studies shows that quality 
applications are common cases of success for Industry 4.0 technologies.  The data driven nature of Industry 4.0 lends 
itself to the skills of quality professionals.  Taking a quality driven approach to implementation may be a successful 
strategy for those businesses with quality as a strategic focus for competitive success.  Quality professionals already 
in possession of data skills and continuous improvement mindsets are well suited to drive digital transformation.  A 
model for a Quality 4.0 implementation strategy is developed through thematic analysis of the literature on Industry 
4.0 and case study analysis of successful Industry 4.0 implementations.

1. Introduction 
Industry 4.0 is an important topic for the future of manufacturing.  It can be described as the application of digital 
technologies to enhance our capabilities through data and information usage, and has been characterized as the fourth 
industrial revolution (Schwab, 2017).  In spite of this shift towards digital transformation less than 30% of such 
transformations are reported as being successful (De la Boutetière, Montagner, & Reich, 2018).  Low success rates 
for implementation point to an opportunity to develop strategies and guidelines for digital transformation.  This 
opportunity is further highlighted by a limited amount of literature on Industry 4.0 implementation (Pozzi, Rossi, & 
Secchi, 2021).   
 
Due to positioning within an organization along with skills in data collection and utilization, quality departments have 
been identified as potential drivers for Industry 4.0 implementations (Nicole M Radziwill, 2018).  Quality 
professionals may also be strong candidates to drive Industry 4.0 efforts as many Industry 4.0 use cases are focused 
on quality improvement (Jacob, 2017).  Early research on the topic of Industry 4.0 also shows overlap with Total 
Quality Management (TQM) methodology as a potential success factor in an Industry 4.0 strategy (Babatunde, 2020).  
The quality discipline shows potential to have major influence on digital transformations within industry and a quality 
centered approach to Industry 4.0 deployment is worth exploring.

2077","such as mental and physical fatigue.  Performing a 100% inspection task is very repetitive, and repetitive work is the 
most appropriate to automate.  Machine Learning has allowed computer-based systems to perform visual inspections 
with accuracy rivaling human operators.  Quality 4.0 applications may capitalize on 100% inspection opportunities 
which would free human resources up to perform tasks of greater complexity.  The quality professional is likely the 
most appropriate individual to lead the effort of implementation of autonomous inspection systems due to their 
visibility to both the technical aspect of products and the operations aspect of manufacturing.  A proposed initial model 
for Quality 4.0 implementation is shown in figure 4: 
 
 
Figure 4 - Quality 4.0 Implementation Model 
 
This model suits the quality professional as it mirrors the traditional Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle of continuous 
improvement.  Quality skills are likely to be critical across all steps of the implementation process.  During the problem 
identification phase, it is critical to identify an appropriate problem.  An appropriate problem in this model is one in 
which there exists the potential for data collection and application in such a way that the usage of this data will directly 
influence the outcome of the process.  Problems in which useful data cannot be conceptualized or collected in a way 
that isn’t significantly cost prohibitive to the effort are not appropriate.  Problems which are not standard or repeatable 
enough for data to be modeled consistently are also not appropriate.  Conceptualizing the data use case and strategizing 
how to augment the human system, phases one and two in the model, are tasks appropriate for quality departments 
already versed in data skills with data driven mindsets.  The third and fourth phases in the model are broader and will 
require diverse skill sets.  For the implementation and lessons learned portions of the process, the quality department 
may engage with a team including production, IT, engineering, and other groups, however as the goal of these 
implementations is centered on improving business performance through data usage it is likely that quality 
professionals may still be the most appropriate owners of this process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Industry 4.0 is affecting the entire global business landscape.  It goes well beyond quality departments or the quality 
profession.  Due to the data centered nature of Industry 4.0 and the established data skills and focus of the quality 
profession, Quality 4.0 may be an appropriate strategic approach to the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies 
for the purpose of improved business performance.  The context of the business and its core competencies and market 
strategies are relevant in determining how to initiate a digital transformation and Quality 4.0 is not the only appropriate 
approach to Industry 4.0 technology deployment.  Quality professionals are well positioned within organizations to 
enhance digital transformation strategies, and quality driven digital transformation should be considered by companies 
with quality as a key business focus.

1. Introduction 
Based on the conditions currently experienced by every country worldwide, including Indonesia, during the COVID-19 
pandemic, all business sectors have undergone drastic changes. The COVID-19 pandemic is bringing new and 
unexpected challenges to universities worldwide (Zalite & Zvirbule, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic entered 
Indonesia in March 2020 and forced all business sectors to adapt to these changes, including the education sector. Like 
other sectors, researchers are also aware that the education sector is also significantly affected. In addition to the impact 
on the learning system, the COVID-19 pandemic has also brought huge financial consequences to the higher education 
sector (Halterbeck et al., 2020). As part of the education sector, universities' ability to adapt in the face of a pandemic 
situation is tested so that they can continue to provide the best exposure and service to the community with their 
technological knowledge. Failure to adapt will have various impacts on universities, one of which is the financial 
impact of lower enrolment. An online approach is a good choice for universities to continue to establish good relations 
and maintain exposure to potential students (Rager, 2020). One of the strategies that universities can apply is the 
application of Social Media Marketing which can help universities do marketing in the midst of limiting social contacts 
through social media. The social media domain has become a low-cost but high-quality source of information about 
everything that is happening in the market (Constantinides, 2014).  
 
The implementation of Social Media Marketing will also facilitate various online marketing activities such as targeted 
advertising, social media marketing, dissemination of information related to online campus tours, open houses, 
promotions, information about lectures, etc. Statistical data generated from the use of social media can also provide 
information or knowledge to universities regarding various matters, such as ongoing trends, public opinion, levels of 
interest or anxiety, and so on (Ostrowski, n.d.). These insights can then be used to make adjustments or changes to 
strategies, services, products, promotions, price calculations, etc. (Woodcock et al., 2011). This enables universities to 
better understand customer needs or desires and combine marketing strategies, customer service and visual content that 
attracts customer attention through social media. In theory, Social Media Marketing has a positive impact, and through

The results of testing the research hypothesis using the bootstrapping method show that Social Media Marketing has a 
positive and significant direct influence on Marketing Performance. Social Media Marketing also has a positive and 
significant direct influence on Customer Satisfaction. Lastly, Customer Satisfaction also has a positive and significant 
direct influence on Marketing Performance. The three conclusions were drawn based on the original sample values , 
which were all positive values (Hair et al., 2017) and T-Statistics, which were all greater than 1.96 (Avkiran & Ringle, 
2018). From these results, it is found that there is a positive and significant influence both the direct influence of Social 
Media Marketing on Marketing Performance and indirectly through Customer Satisfaction. This proves that all 
research hypotheses are proven, especially the first hypothesis (H1) and the fourth hypothesis (H4), which this research 
wants to prove. According to (Cepeda et al., 2017), a condition where direct and indirect effects have a significant 
influence represents partial mediation. Hair also explained that partial mediation occurs when a mediator variable 
partially explains the relationship between exogenous and endogenous constructs (Hair et al., 2017). Then, the results 
of hypothesis testing also show that the direct and indirect effects both have a positive direction. In addition, Hair also 
believes that partial mediation can be broken down into Complementary Partial Mediation and Competitive Partial 
Mediation. Complementary Partial Mediation is used to describe situations where the direction of influence of direct 
and indirect influence points in the same direction, while Competitive Partial Mediation is used to describe situations 
where the direction of influence of direct and indirect influences points in the opposite direction (Hair et al., 2017). 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the type of mediation that occurs in this research model is Complementary Partial 
Mediation. 
 
4. Conclusions and Suggestions 
4.1 Conclusion 
From these results for the formulation of the first problem, social media Marketing directly influences Marketing 
Performance. The second problem is, Social Media Marketing has an indirect influence on Marketing Performance 
through Customer Satisfaction. It is found that the influence of Social Media Marketing on Marketing Performance 
is positive and significant both in terms of directly and indirectly through Customer Satisfaction. The direction of 
the same influence and the level of significance indicates that the type of mediation in the research model is 
Complementary Partial Mediation. For the third problem, the satisfaction of students who register from online 
registration during the pandemic for the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic periods at a university, it can be 
concluded from the survey results of respond that 85% of respondents answered that they were satisfied with the 
performance of the university.

For the universities, the use of social media marketing can have an important impact on customer satisfaction and 
marketing performance. Therefore, the researcher suggests universities to increase the use of Social Media 
Marketing to support better marketing performance and increase customer satisfaction. In addition, universities are 
advised to use Instagram in distributing various information regarding registration, scholarships, majors, educational 
activities and open houses, as well as other important information because of the results of questionnaires regarding 
students who register online at a university for the academic year 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 the most aware of social 
media used by universities is Instagram, as many as 93 respondents answered Instagram as one of the social media 
known by respondents. The researchers also suggest universities to adopt social media such as WhatsApp and LINE 
and improve performance in serving customers through social media to increase the level of customer satisfaction. 
This is based on research that revealed that both social media were the most widely used by respondents to 
communicate with universities when experiencing registration problems.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, we consider modelling of a hybrid vehicle for autonomous vehicles (AV) algorithm development, 
simulation, and verification. Our research platform is a Ford Fusion plugin hybrid vehicle with drive-by-wire 
conversion done by Dataspeed Inc.  The vehicle is equipped with steering, throttle, break, wheel speed and several 
other sensors and actuators all connected to the vehicle CAN network. Furthermore, we have lidar, radar and multiple 
camera sensors, and a vibration resistant GPU desktop. We will drive the research vehicle both on the campus and on 
local highways and generate a rich dataset for various modelling studies. Our preliminary test results show that existing 
hardware is capable of recording all relevant CAN network activity without any data packet loss. We have explored 
linear differential equation-based models including the air friction but planning to explore both nonlinear and AI based 
more complex models. All of these vehicle models are planned to be executed on an external hardware accelerator, 
Speedgoat Performance Real-Time Target Unit, with full MATLAB/Simulink integration. In the full version of the 
paper, we will present both experimental results and provide a detailed comparison between different modelling 
alternatives, computational demand, and modelling accuracy.

Abstract 
 
This research aims to get empirical evidence in detecting the effect of age of board commissioners, the 
experience of board commissioners, education of board commissioners, and firm size on the quality of 
financial statements. The population of this research is the consumer goods companies listed on IDX 2015-
2017. The total sample of this research is 61 data for three years period of research. The research sample 
used is purposive sampling. Companies' annual reports were analyzed using multiple linear regression. 
This study shows that firm size has a significant influence on financial statement quality. Meanwhile, 
board commissioners' age, experience, and education do not influence financial statement quality.

1. Introduction 
The development of an increasing age resulted in the growth of various companies engaged in various 
sectors. This resulted in increasingly intense competition in the business world. Company management 
must compete and demonstrate good performance capabilities to attract investors to invest their capital in 
the company. The company's good performance can be seen in its annual report. 
 
The annual report is a report of developments and achievements that were achieved in a year. The contents 
of the annual report include financial statements and other information that covers the organization's 
performance or company for one year. This report is a form of corporate responsibility to the internal and 
external parties of the company. Structurally the annual report must first be presented by the board of 
directors and endorsed by the board of commissioners. The annual report contains financial statements. In 
the financial statements, the company must prepare the report in accordance with financial accounting 
standards, namely standards recognized by the government. According to (Kasmir, 2011) in a simple 
sense, financial statements are reports that show the company's financial condition at this time or in a 
certain period. The financial statements describe the company's financial items obtained in a period. 
Looking at a company's financial statements will show the company's activities. The company's financial 
statements result from an accounting process based on accounting standards as a measure of company 
performance. Therefore, companies need to improve the quality of their companies, namely by 
transparently presenting financial reports. 
 
To produce quality financial reports, objectivity, transparency, accountability and timely reporting are 
required. Moreover, to produce quality financial reports, the role of managers, commissioners and 
shareholders is required to prepare financial statements. 
According to (Akhgar, 2014), the quality of financial statements is to develop transparency and publish 
high-quality annual reports through complete and comprehensive disclosure. The quality of financial 
statements has always been an interesting topic for the board of directors, shareholders, researchers and

Education variable board of commissioners (EDUC BOARD) has a significant value of 0.242

rejected because of the value of Sig. greater than the significant level of 0.05 (0.242> 0.05), and 
the t value is smaller than the t table (1.181 <2.00100). So, this shows no influence between the 
education variables of the board of commissioners (EDUC BOARD) on the quality of financial

significant level of 0.05 (0.001 <0.05), and the t value is greater than the t table (3.484> 2.00100).

Based on the results of the regression analysis presented in the above table that is when calculated with the 
f table that Df 1 (numerator) = k -1 and Df 2 (denominator) = n - k, k is the number of independent and 
dependent variables and n number of observations. So, it can be concluded that Df1 = 4 and Df2 = 58. 
Based on the F distribution table, the F value of the table is 2.53 (5.390> 2.53) (table 8), which means that 
the independent variables together influence the dependent variable. And if seen from the significant value 
of the F test results of 0.001, then Ho is rejected because of the significant value in the table <0.05. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The results of this study can be concluded as follows: (1) The results of testing the first hypothesis indicate 
that the age variable of the board of commissioners does not affect the quality of financial statements in the 
company. (2) The results of the second hypothesis testing show that the experience variable of the board of 
commissioners does not affect the quality of financial statements in the company. (3) The results of testing 
the third hypothesis show that the board of education variable does not affect the quality of financial 
statements in the company. (4) The results of the fourth hypothesis testing show that firm size variables 
affect the quality of financial statements in the company. 
 
For further research, it is expected that the research sample will not be small in number, so it can use a 
sample of companies such as manufacturing, banking, and others and can also expand its observation years 
and add research variables such as company age, the role of internal audit and others that can affect the 
quality of financial statements.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to determine if intellectual capital can influence the firm value with financial performance as the 
intervening variable. The research method used to analyze the problem in this research uses the multiple linear 
regression method. The research data was obtained from the Indonesia Stock Exchange of companies in the financial 
sector, registered in 2014-2016. The independent variables used in the research are STVA, VAHU, and VACA, each 
as a part of intellectual capital. Variable dependent from this research is the firm value and financial performance as 
the intervening variable. The results of this study are neither STVA, VAHU, nor VACA affects the firm value 
individually. Intellectual capital does not affect firm value, and financial performance is unable to act as an 
intervening variable in this study.

1. Introduction 
The era of globalization, as we know, it has increased opportunities and competition for various economic actors, 
both individually and in organizations and companies. In the era of globalization, businesspeople must continue 
developing and using their resources effectively and efficiently to achieve maximum results. Increasing business 
competition in the global market requires companies to use a variety of ways and strategies to gain excellence and 
business. People are now aware that the resources that need to be managed and improved are limited to tangible 
assets and intangible assets. Therefore, business organizations increasingly emphasize the importance of knowledge 
assets as a form of intangible assets (Handayani, 2015). 
 
One form of an intangible asset is intellectual capital. The public in Hamidah (2014) has developed a model known 
as VAIC ™ (Value Added Intellectual Coefficient). This model measures intellectual capital through the added 
value generated and breaks it down into three main elements. First is Value Added Capital Employed (VACA). It 
describes customer capital. Next, Value-Added Human Capital (VAHU) represents human capital. Lastly is 
Structural Capital Value Added (STVA), which describes the structural capital of the company. Intellectual capital is 
believed to be able to increase value-added to the company, as well as increase trust in investors, thereby increasing 
company value. Several previous studies have also proven that intellectual capital can increase the value of a 
company (Nuryaman, 2015).

2103","added value for the company. In this case, human resources. Human resources reflect the collective ability to 
produce the best solutions based on the knowledge possessed by people who are in the company to add value to the 
company. 
 
The test results show that VAHU is not able to influence the value of the company (PBV). It is because VAHU itself 
is one part of VAIC™ so as not to be able to measure/provide significant added value for the company. In terms of 
human capital or human resources, the investor has not considered it. It is due to several possibilities. Namely, the 
investor does not get or see the results of the training conducted by the company or matters. This is regarded as an 
internal interest, so it is not considered because it is deemed to be unable to raise the stock price for investors. The 
results of this study are in line with the research of Dewi & Isynuwardhana (2014) and Wijaya & Amanah (2017). 
Their studies also obtained the same results, namely that VAHU does not affect price-to-book value. 
 
While the STVA variable has a significance level of 0.8920, which is higher than 0.05 (> 0.05), based on the 
significance value, 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻3rejected. The results of this test indicate that the STVA variable partially has not been able to 
increase the value of the company. It is due to structural capital being the value of organizational infrastructure and 
the type of knowledge stored through manuals, guidelines, or in the company's information system. Because it is 
considered only as a means to connect data with people, structural capital is not considered a variable that can 
provide added value to the company by investors. The results of this study are in line with the research of Dewi & 
Isynuwardhana (2014) and Wijaya & Amanah (2017). Their study also obtained the same results, namely that STVA 
does not affect the price-to-book value. 
 
STVA, VAHU, and VACA are respectively part of VAIC™. F test shows the number 0.885102, which is higher 
than 0.05 (> 0.05), based on the significance value then 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻4rejected. The results of this test indicate that it is 
variable VAIC™ have not been able to increase the value of the company. It can be caused by VAIC™ not yet seen 
by investors and is only an assessment for private parties. Investors can also assess that the resources spent to 
develop intellectual capital can be less effective. It will reduce the allocated cash to dividends that are the 
expectations of investors. The types of companies in the financial sector are also able to influence the reasons for the 
results of the research. Namely, companies engaged in finance will be seen and valued by investors. If investors do 
not see tangible results written on the financial statements, then intellectual capital cannot be used as an excuse to 
add value to the company. The results of this study are in line with research by Karyanto (2015), Hadiwijaya & 
Rohman (2013), and Susanti (2016). Their study also obtained the same results, namely that VAIC ™ does not 
affect the price-to-book value as a proxy for corporate value. 
 
4.2.2 The Effect of Intellectual Capital on Company Value with Financial Performance as an 
Intervening Variable 
Based on table 5, it can be concluded that the intervening variable, namely ROA, has a significance value of 0.0834. 
The significance value has a value higher than the significant value of 0.05, which means that the variable has no 
influence on firm value (PBV) as a variable dependent. 
 
Table 6 sums up the independent variable. VAIC has a significance value of 0,000. It has a significant value that is 
smaller than the significant value of 0.05, which means that the variable has an influence on corporate financial 
performance (ROA) as an intervening variable. 
 
From the results of the test, the intervening variable, namely ROA, does not have an influence on firm value (PBV) 
as the dependent variable. The independent variable, VAIC, has an impact on the company's financial performance 
(ROA) as an intervening variable. From these results, we can conclude that corporate financial performance (ROA) 
is not able to mediate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate value (PBV). Intellectual capital is 
not able to influence corporate value (PBV) with organizational financial performance (ROA) as an intervening 
variable. 
 
5. Conclusion and suggestion 
5.1. Conclusion 
The test results in chapter 4 can be summarized as follows: 
1.       Based on the test results, the VACA variable as part of VAIC ™ does not affect firm value (PBV). It is 
because employed capital owned by the company has not been able to produce added value for the company.

and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022

2109","Furthermore, the company value is still widely seen and assessed through financial statements. It shows how 
much profit has been achieved (profit), and dividends can be obtained by investors. 
 
2.       Based on the test results, the VAHU variable as part of VAIC ™ does not affect firm value (PBV). This 
is because investors have not considered human capital because of several possibilities. Namely, investors do 
not get or see the results of the training that has been carried out by the company, or it is considered an 
internal interest. It is not considered because it is deemed to be unable to raise share prices for the investor. 
 
 
3.       Based on the test results, the STVA variable as part of VAIC ™ does not affect firm value (PBV). Since 
investors have not considered structural capital because it is considered only as a means to connect data with 
people. Structural capital is not considered as a variable that can provide added value to the company by 
investors. 
 
4.       Based on the test results, intellectual capital (VAIC ™) is not able to influence the value of the company 
(PBV). It is caused by VAIC ™, is not yet highly regarded by investors and is only an assessment for private 
parties. Investors can also assess that the resources expended to develop intellectual capital can be less 
effective. It will reduce the allocated cash to dividends that are in the hope of investors. 
 
 
5.       Based on the test results, the company's financial performance (ROA) is unable to mediate the 
relationship between intellectual capital (VAIC ™) and firm value (PBV). Based on the test results, 
intellectual capital does not influence the company's financial performance, so an indirect relationship 
between the three variables cannot occur. Therefore, intellectual capital is unable to change the value of the 
company through financial performance as an intervening variable. 
 
5.2. Suggestion 
a. 
As the research progresses and based on the results, some suggestions to the following stakeholders: 
b. For future researchers, measurement of intellectual capital can use methods other than (VAIC ™). 
Corporate value can use other proxies such as Tobin's Q or market-to-book value. It allows for more 
extensive results and increases the period of observation that is expected to be able to provide a broad 
picture better.  
c. 
For stakeholders, it is recommended to pay attention to the intellectual capital of the company. It serves 
as a supervisory function for the management of the company and as a material for consideration in 
decision making. 
d. For further researchers, it can add a more recent research period so that it gets more significant results. Or 
change the company sector so that it can compare results between industries that are expected to affect 
research results.

Abstract 
 
Startup growth is fantastic, just like google, Facebook, Alibaba, and other big IT companies provide a new overview 
of the IT business. The startup is a new IT-based business built and pioneered for about three years. The project 
manager is a critical element in the startup run, starting with a CEO who first planned, pioneered, and built his 
startup. The role of a project manager is vital in building a startup, especially how cognitive ability/knowledge and 
emotional intelligence becomes the key to leading all the project and startup member to complete their project. This 
research aims to know the effect of emotional intelligence and cognitive ability on successful project managers and 
the effect of gender in moderating those variables. This research uses 100 project managers in a Startup company as 
respondents. The method used is Multiple Regression Linear. The results show that variable emotional intelligence 
and cognitive ability significantly influence successful project managers by about 76.3%, and there is no effect of 
gender in moderating these variables.

1. Introduction  
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a thing that continues to grow and experience progress every 
year. In Indonesia, digital growth, especially in the internet user sector, has increased by 50% penetration and is the 
second-largest contributor to the economy, which is expected to increase six times by 2020. Along with digital 
development, many new startups are emerging with solutions provided to problems experienced by the community, 
such as e-commerce, fintech, travel, etc. The startup, developed in 1995, began in the United States with several 
names of large companies such as Google, Amazon, and other companies. Based on data from startupranking.com in 
2018, the number of startups reached 84,448 startups. 
 
 
The rapid development of startups in the world also affects the development of startups in Indonesia. Indowebster 
was the first startup in Indonesia in 2007, followed by Tokopedia (2009), Go-Jek (2010), and Traveloka (2012). The 
number of startups that continues to increase from year to year makes Indonesia the country with the highest number 
of startups in ASEAN and ranks 3rd in the world with 1,703 startups. Some Startups in Indonesia managed to carve

4.1 Conclusion 
Based on the results of the research that has been done, it can be summarized as follows: First, there is a significant 
influence of emotional intelligence and cognitive abilities on the success of a project manager partially or 
simultaneously, with an influence level of 76.3% which means that emotional intelligence and cognitive ability 
become very influential factors in the success of a project manager. Second, there is no significant influence of 
gender variables in moderating the influence of emotional intelligence and cognitive abilities on the project 
manager's success. 
 
4.2 Suggestions 
A project manager is one of the important positions for the company, where the position is a reference in the success 
of a project and a Startup company where the role of a project manager becomes the key for the startup to move 
forward. Good cognitive and emotional abilities are needed to lead each member to complete the project and achieve 
the project objectives. Related to the research done and the results obtained from data processing, the suggestions 
that can be given to Startup companies are as follows: First, the company can conduct tests in recruiting new 
employees and project managers. The test is conducted to determine the emotional intelligence and cognitive 
abilities of employees with a special assessment of the company. Secondly, the company can provide training 
periodically to increase employees' emotional intelligence and cognitive abilities and special training for someone 
who will be trusted to be a project manager. The training aims to prepare the project manager for the project to be 
handled, to improve performance, character, interact with the team, ability to work in teams and explore the 
knowledge and insights possessed by the project manager. Training will provide knowledge to project managers to 
lead and complete projects effectively and efficiently with the team.

1. Introduction 
The world economy is currently experiencing a very significant increase. This is because the consumption of the 
world community continues to increase, resulting in primary and secondary needs also increasing, especially the 
needs of people in Indonesia, one of which is the health sector. At present, Indonesian society is increasingly paying 
attention to individual and family health problems. This encourages people to get health services. Many health 
services exist, one of which is insurance. 
 
According to the Financial Services Authority (OJK), the number of insurance companies that have business 
licenses to operate in Indonesia as of December 31, 2016, is 383 companies. The number consists of 146 insurance

2122","5.4 Analysis of Discussion on Intention to Quit (Y) 
Based on the results of processing the questionnaire that was distributed to 50 respondents to Insurance Company X, 
found that the lowest value in the intention to quit variable is found in item 1 with the statement ""the type of work 
now makes me bored"", with a value of 2.9. The statement is based on the dimension of intention to quit with an 
indicator of the mind to stop. After conducting interviews with several employees, it was found that the cause of the 
statement was of low value because at Insurance Company X employees have new jobs every day where the work is 
a target that employees must complete. The highest value of this variable is found in item 17 with the statement 
""The opportunity in another company is so great that I wish to leave my current company"", which is worth 3.44. The 
statement is based on the dimensions of intention to quit with indicators looking for other companies. That is 
because many employees compare compensation in other companies where the company provides better 
compensation with the same position as employees in Insurance Company X. From the Intention to quit 
questionnaire, the average value of 3.235 was obtained. 
 
5.5 Implications of Research Results 
5.5.1 Effect of Career Development on Intention to Quit 
Career Development has an effect of 49.4% on Intention to quit at Insurance Company Xand the remaining 50.6% 
are influenced by other factors not examined in this study. Career development and intention to quit have a strong 
and unidirectional relationship. 
 
5.5.2 Effect of Compensation on Intention to Quit 
Compensation has an influence of 68.4% of the Intention to quit at Insurance Company Xand the remaining 31.6% 
are influenced by other factors not examined in this study. Compensation and intention to quit have a strong and 
unidirectional relationship. 
 
5.5.3 Influence of Organizational Justice against Intention to Quit 
Organizational Justice has a 70% influence on Intention to quit at Insurance Company Xand the remaining 30% are 
influenced by other factors not examined in this study. Organizational Justice and Intention to quit have a strong and 
unidirectional relationship. 
 
5.5.4 Effects of Career Development, Compensation and Organizational Justice on Intention to 
Quit 
Career Development, Compensation and Organizational Justice has an influence of 73.4% of the Intention to Quit at 
Insurance Company X and the remaining 26.6% is influenced by other factors not examined in this study. Career 
development, compensation, and organizational justice towards the intention to quit have a strong and unidirectional 
relationship. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Career Development has a strong and significant effect on the intention to quit at Insurance Company X. 
Compensation has a strong and significant effect on the intention to quit at Insurance Company X. Organizational 
Justice has a strong and significant effect on the intention to quit at Insurance Company X, and Career Development,

Abstract 
 
The purpose of the research was to determine the effect of Time Budget Pressure, Task Complexity and Professional 
Commitment on Reduced Audit Quality in Tangerang and South Tangerang. This research used primary data, and 
the amount of sample is 81 respondents. The sampling technique used simple random sampling. The data analysis 
technique used multiple linear regression analysis. The result showed that time budget pressure positively affects 
reduced audit quality. In comparison, task complexity and professional commitment do not affect reduced audit 
quality. This research only explains 10,1% of factors influencing reduced audit quality, while the remaining 89,9% 
is explained by other variables not included in this research model.

1. Introduction 
Many Public Accounting Firms (KAP) in Indonesia are not possible if there is competition over the provision of 
services by public accounting firms, so it requires every public accountant to improve their performance to improve 
the quality of their audits. Audit quality is a condition where an auditor can find and report errors in the audited 
financial statements (Riny, 2015). The applicable standard is the Public Accountant Professional Standards (SPAP), 
a guideline for regulating the general standards for auditing public accountants and regulating all matters relating to 
the assignment and independence in mental attitude. Although in the theory of De Angelo in Saadah (2016) it is 
stated that audit quality can be seen from the level of auditor compliance in carrying out the various stages that 
should be carried out in an auditing activity, but the reality is different. More violations have resulted in a decline in 
audit quality. 
 
 In this regard, the quality of auditors is in the public spotlight with the emergence of the phenomenon of Reduced 
Audit Quality (RAQ) or dysfunctional behaviour carried out by public accountants in Indonesia in recent years. To 
that end, the Ministry of Finance as the supervisor of the Public Accountant, almost annually issues a Decree on the 
Suspension of a Public Accountant License. In 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009. And in 2017 yesterday, a total of 4 
Public Accountants were sanctioned with license suspension with various terms, including AP Drs. Arthawan 
Santika, Ak., MM, CPA for 12 months; AP Hizbullah Husein for 12 months; AP SoetjiptoWirjosoemarto for 12 
months; AP Rahardja for 9 months. Most of them had their permits frozen because they did not maintain the audit 
working papers and did not complete the Independent Auditor's Report with working papers. In addition to the AP 
Freeze Sanction, the issuance of AP License Revocation Sanctions also occurred in 2017, precisely on April 17. The 
sanction was given to the Public Accountant Rodi Kartamulja because he did not maintain the general audit services 
working paper on the financial statements. 720 Independent Auditor Reports were not equipped with working

1) The constant value is 0.348 which means that if all the independent variables are 0 or constant, then the 
independent variables outside the model will still make the audit quality decrease increase by 0.348. 
2) The value of the beta coefficient for the Time Budget Pressure variable has a positive value of 0.254. The 
significance level of 0.024 <0.05 shows that time budget pressure has a positive effect on the decline in 
audit quality. 
3) The beta coefficient value for the Task Complexity variable has a positive value of 0.231 with a 
significance level obtained of 0.104> 0.05. This shows that the complexity of the task does not affect the 
decline in audit quality produced by auditors of the Public Accounting Firm (KAP) in the Tangerang and 
South Tangerang regions. These conditions indicate that auditors in the area have understood and clearly 
understood their respective duties in completing their work in a professional manner and the existence of 
team making in each audit assignment to ease audit work. 
4) The beta coefficient value for the Professional Commitment Variable has a positive value of 0.129 with a 
significance level of 0.363> 0.05. This shows that professional commitment does not affect the decline in 
audit quality. This result is because most respondents have a long service life for accountants. The 
existence of alternative opportunities for other professions makes the majority of junior auditors who have 
work experience with a span of 1-2 years not fully committed to the profession they run. 
 
It was concluded that among all the independent variables, the size of the board of directors and the capital adequacy 
ratio had no effect in predicting financial difficulties. It is recommended that companies that are experiencing 
financial difficulties should make improvements to their performance better. 
 
5. Conclusion and Suggestion 
From the results of research and discussion used in accordance with the objectives of the hypothesis conducted by 
multiple regression analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1. Time Budget Pressure influences Audit Quality Decrease. From the results of tests that have been done, the 
first hypothesis can be accepted with a significance value of 0.024 <0.05, which means Time Budget 
Pressure has a positive influence on the decline in audit quality. This means that the higher the Time 
Budget Pressure perceived by the auditor, the higher the auditor's tendency to take actions that can reduce 
audit quality. 
2. The complexity of the task does not affect the Decrease in Audit Quality. From the results of tests that have 
been done, the second hypothesis is rejected because the significance value is 0.104> 0.05. It is possible 
that this could happen because auditors in the Tangerang and South Tangerang regions have a clear 
understanding of the work they are doing and the existence of a team that is present in every audit 
assignment so that it can help ease audit work. 
3. Professional Commitment does not affect Audit Quality Decrease. From the results of tests that have been 
done, the third hypothesis is rejected because the significance value is 0.914> 0.05. This happens because 
the majority of respondents are junior auditors who have only 1-2 years of experience and are not fully 
committed to their profession. Therefore, the level of professional commitment does not affect the auditor 
in taking actions that can reduce audit quality. 
4. The most dominant variable in decline in audit quality is Time Budget Pressure. Judging from the results of 
the regression test, obtained standardized beta coefficients of 0.237. 
During the research process, there were some limitations. The limitations in this study are: 
1. The results of the study only reflect the condition of auditors in the Tangerang and South Tangerang 
regions. 
2. The number of respondents is less varied. With the majority of respondents being junior auditors who only 
have 1-2 years of audit experience, they are only able to measure the perception of junior auditors. 
3. This study did not conduct a pilot study due to time constraints, so there is one question that is not valid. 
4. This study only uses three independent variables, where the three variables can only explain 10.1% of the 
factors that can reduce audit quality so that the remaining 89.9% is explained by other variables that have 
not been examined in this study. 
 
Based on the conclusions above and the limitations that exist in this study, the suggestions that can be given in this 
study are:

2135","1. The next researcher is expected to be able to increase the number of respondents, which may be obtained 
by sending a non-physical questionnaire, which is distributing questionnaires online using google docs, so 
that it can expand the sample area and can save time and money. 
2. Researchers can then be conducted in other areas besides Tangerang and South Tangerang so that they can 
give different results. 
3. The researcher can then expand the types of respondents used, such as senior auditors, supervisors, 
managers or even partners, so that there are variations in position, with a minimum of 3 years of work 
experience as a research respondent. 
4. The next researcher is expected to add other variables that are not included in this study so that they can 
find out the possibility of other factors that can affect the decline in audit quality, such as locus of control, 
audit risk, materiality, organizational commitment, and so forth as well as increasing the choice of the type 
of assignment criteria in the questionnaire so that it can find out the type of industry that is done by each of 
the KAP. 
 
Below are some suggestions for the Public Accounting Firm: 
1. The Public Accounting Firm should be able to consider the time budget that will be set for each audit 
assignment so as not to encourage the auditor to take actions that can reduce audit quality. 
2. Accountants should be able to continue to improve and maintain their professional attitude in each 
assignment so that the quality of the resulting audit is good, and of course, public trust in public accounting 
firms can also be increased.

Abstract 
 
Virtual Reality and Deep Learning are technologies that can enhance Human Engineering. This paper discusses some 
experiments using paradigms of neural networks (Machine Learning) vs. Deep Learning to predict the NASA Task 
Load Index (TLX) from general information and brain waves without answering the questionnaire. The environment 
of the experiments was a virtual reality-based one using OpenSim to build it and Oculus Rift to navigate it. 
Electroencephalograms were used to measure the level of engagement of the users. After the tasks were performed, 
the TLX questionnaire was completed. Resilient Backpropagation and Deep Learning-based architectures were used 
to create a mapping of brain waves and demographic information to the TLX index. The results are very positive, and 
the TLX index can be predicted. These results can support the development of real-time assessment systems and the 
build-up of adaptable/smart user interfaces.

1.Introduction 
The Human engineering field supports the appropriate evolutions of technology to adapt it to human use. The main 
focus is on the adaptability of hardware, software, and systems. Providing humans with the most effective tools will 
allow them to improve their capability and performance when performing a task. At the same time, it can help ensure 
a better level of safety. In this case, this discipline is a key factor of this research since it involves studying human 
factors related to the workload assessment. The mental workload assessment based on the performance of a task is 
measured based on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA TLX) questionnaire 
(Rubio et al., 2004). The rating is based on six dimensions: mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, 
performance, effort, and frustration (Grier et al., 2003).  
By predicting the mental workload, engineers will be able to find different strategies and the best ways to focus mental 
workload on fundamental tasks. Doing so will increase, at the same time, the level of attention that is given to a certain 
task. TLX allows one to identify key factors that can influence a person's performance to change it and accommodate 
the necessary adjustments. An increase in productivity and effectiveness will result from such changes in better 
allocation of tasks.  
2. AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many definitions that have increased over more than 6 decades. However, Dr. John 
McCarthy first used the term AI (Researcher at MIT and Professor at Stanford University) in 1955. McCarthy 
defined AI as that science and engineering field that designs and makes intelligent machines (Sutton, 2020). So, one 
of the most important features is that machines can learn in the same way (or better) as humans.

neural networks to predict the data of the 11822 rows. We also used the MAE and MSE as references for finding the 
lowest percentage of error during this process. This process helped us decide which neural network gives the best 
results in predicting the NASA TLX.  
To complete our experiment, we configured the predictors of both neural networks to receive the already trained 
neurons and the validation data separately as inputs. Therefore, the module could produce a new prediction for the 
11822 data and complete the validation process. Our final experiment with the whole data led us to believe that the 
Resilient Backpropagation (RProp) was better at predicting the NASA TLX. The following chart shows the MAE and 
MSE results found in both RProp and DL:

In the future, including in this research, the Presence Questionnaire (PQ) finding will offer a variety of factors to 
contribute to the study of mental workload. First, it contributes to evaluating the experience of being in a Virtual 
Environment for a person. This evaluation will help find pertinent factors that affect a person's attention depending on 
their surrounding conditions.

Abstract 
 
This research aims to study how emotional intelligence and locus of control affect job stress and its implication 
for job satisfaction among sales staff at financial technology business unit XYZ bank. This associative research 
uses a quantitative method with path analysis as a data analysis technique. This study shows that in a sample of 
140 salespeople, emotional intelligence and locus of control have a negative and positive effect on job stress. 
Job stress also has a significant role in strengthening how emotional intelligence and locus of control affect job 
satisfaction. This study concludes that emotional intelligence and locus of control affect job satisfaction both 
directly and indirectly. The recommendation is to implement an employee assistance program and compile a 
training handbook.

1.  Introduction 
The increasing transactions on the online channel have encouraged the formation of banking technology, namely 
financial technology. Financial technology itself is a combination of financial service activities with information 
technology. As many as 59% of global banking industry leaders agree that financial technology dominates the 
development of banking technology (EY, 2017). Research conducted by DailySocial also showed that in 2017, 
60.96% of respondents had used financial technology services (DailySocial, 2018). The rapid development of 
financial technology requires banks to adapt and compete with other financial technology companies by 
utilizing the various resources they have. 
 
Human resources are one of the top priorities of company leaders, including in the financial technology 
industry. The survey results show that 15% of corporate leaders choose human capital as one of the five main 
priorities after innovation used to take advantage of opportunities. In the same survey, 52% of company leaders

2146","from supervisors to parse their stress. In addition, research results are also consistent with research by Hamwi, 
Rutherford, Boles, &Madupalli (2014), where sales staff with a higher external locus of control have lower job 
satisfaction. Vice versa, individuals with an internal locus of control have higher job satisfaction. This is 
supported by the research results by Dhole &Typnis (2013), which show that the locus of control is one 
important variable and often predicts employee job satisfaction. 
 
4.  Conclusion and Suggestion 
There is a significant influence between emotional intelligence and locus of control simultaneously by 42% on 
work stress on sales staff in the financial technology business unit of PT Bank XYZ. Partially, emotional 
intelligence has a significant effect on work stress with the nature of a negative relationship. At the same time, 
the locus of control also has a significant influence and a positive relationship with work stress. Then, there is a 
significant influence between emotional intelligence, locus of control and work stress simultaneously at 81.5% 
on job satisfaction among sales staff in the business unit of PT Bank XYZ. Where partially, job stress has an 
effect of 43.03%, which is significant and is negative on job satisfaction. Emotional intelligence has a 
significant direct effect and is positive on job satisfaction. In addition, there is an indirect effect between 
emotional intelligence and job satisfaction through work stress. There is also an indirect effect between locus of 
control and job satisfaction through work stress. 
 
The results showed that locus of control significantly affected work stress. In addition, locus of control has a 
direct effect and an indirect effect through job stress on job satisfaction variables. Locus of control has a 
negative and significant relationship to job satisfaction. Thus, job satisfaction will increase for every shift in the 
locus of control toward the internal locus of control. 
 
Based on the discussion, conclusions, and research implications, it can be recommended: 
 
1. The HR department can create an Employee Assistance Program where employees can consult through 
telephone lines, the company's internal web, online communication applications, or meet privately with 
company representatives appointed to handle mental health-related issues. Where employees can 
consult or talk about problems and complaints that are not only limited to the scope of work. This 
program is expected to be a solution for employees with a low level of emotional intelligence and 
external locus of control to increase sales staff job satisfaction both directly and by reducing work 
stress. 
 
2. Compile an annual Training Handbook that lists training programs that exist in that year for employees 
from all levels, both team leaders and team members. The list of training prepared should be the 
training that is needed based on the results of the performance evaluation or condition of the employee 
at the end of the previous year. Based on the research results, one example of training that companies 
currently need is stress management, locus of control, and emotional intelligence. With a well-
structured training plan, it is expected to increase the job satisfaction of sales staff. 
 
 
3. Implement a Gainsharing Plan in an existing Performance-Based Reward where rewards are given to 
the team so that it can reduce the individual workload and foster teamwork. It is expected that 
employee work will be reduced and can improve good relations between employees. This can 
simultaneously improve labour efficiency. 
 
The results showed the characteristics of respondents based on gender, age, last education, and length of work. 
From the research results, most sales staff are women in the 22-25 years age group. Most are high school or 
vocational high school graduates and have only worked for less than one year. Table 2 shows the mean and 
standard deviation of the variables of emotional intelligence, locus of control, job stress, and job satisfaction.

1. Introduction 
According to Law No. 28 of 2007, tax is defined as a mandatory contribution to the state-owned by individuals or 
entities that are coercive based on the Act, with no direct compensation and used for the state for the greatest 
prosperity of the people. 
 
Tax must be paid by taxpayers, both personal taxpayers and corporate taxpayers. Provisions regarding taxpayer 
obligations have been regulated in Law No. 36 of 2008, article 2 paragraph (1). As one of the taxpayers, the 
company should pay taxes in accordance with tax provisions. The Government of Indonesia undertakes various 
kinds of taxation policies to maximize revenue from the tax sector because tax revenue can significantly influence 
the size of the state budget (Nugraha and Meiranto 2015) (Table 1).

2152","5. Conclusion and Suggestion 
Based on the results and analysis that has been carried out regarding the EFFECT OF LIQUIDITY, LEVERAGE, 
PROFITABILITY AND COMPANY SIZE ON TAX AGRESSIVITY using data from banking companies listed on 
the Indonesia Stock Exchange for three years (2014-2016), the following conclusions can be made as follows: 
1. Liquidity has a significant effect on tax aggressiveness. This shows that banking companies are less able to 
meet their short-term obligations. 
2. Leverage does not affect tax aggressiveness. This means that banking companies do not use debt to minimize 
their tax burden. 
3. Profitability does not affect tax aggressiveness. This means that banks have a high profitability value so that 
banks do not experience difficulties in meeting company obligations, namely tax payments. 
4. Company size does not affect tax aggressiveness. This means that banking companies are classified as large and 
overseen by many investors and banking supervision bodies. 
5. Liquidity, Leverage, Profitability and Size of the company have a joint (simultaneous) effect on tax 
aggressiveness. 
 
Based on the conclusions and limitations above, the suggestions for further researchers are as follows: 
1. It is expected to use other variables that affect tax aggressiveness, such as independent commissioners, 
corporate social responsibility, capital intensity, etc. 
2. It is expected to extract data from companies other than banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange, such as mining, agricultural, or real estate companies. 
3. It is expected that the Financial Services Authority will further improve supervision of the company's financial 
ratios.

1. Introduction  
In Indonesia, rapid globalization is shown, among others, by the rapid advancement of information and 
communication technology. This progress has made it very easy for Indonesians to obtain information and 
communicate without being hindered by distance and time. This is motivated by the emergence of the internet. 
This computer network contains information and as a means of data communication in the form of sound, 
images, videos, and texts (Nurmanina, 2013). According to data obtained from Internet World Stats, Indonesia 
is the 5th highest internet user country with 143 million users.

4. Conclusion And Suggestions 
4.1 Conclusion 
This study discusses the effect of transparency, accountability, and participation on wise netizens in social 
media. The conclusions obtained from the results of this study are as follows: 
1. Transparency has a significant positive effect on wise netizens on social media (Facebook). It can be 
concluded that if the transparency of netizens on social media tends to be good, it will lead to netizens 
who are wiser in using social media. The effect of transparency on wise netizens is evident in the 
increasing number of users who provide information correctly to create inter-users trust and the decrease 
in the spread of hoaxes and hate speech.  
2. With increasing netizen accountability in using social media, netizens' policies will also increase. This is 
consistent with the research results in which accountability has a significant positive effect on wise 
netizens on social media (Facebook). The impact of influencing accountability on wise netizens is 
mutual respect and respect for opinions among social media users, not excessive in expressing comments 
(balanced), understanding the meaning of a comment, and reducing the spread of gossip and other 
irresponsible information.

2170","3. Participation has a significant positive effect on wise netizens on social media (Facebook), where the 
increasing participation of netizens in social media will make netizens wiser. Participation aims to create 
netizens who think critically (having sharp research skills and extensive knowledge) in using social 
media and care for one another. It also increases aspirations,  
create netizen solidarity and creativity,  make for more responsive netizens to problems that occur on 
social media.  
4. Transparency, accountability, and simultaneous participation significantly affect wise netizens on social 
media (Facebook). If netizens have transparent and accountable behaviour and participate positively in 
social media, we can be certain that netizens have been wise in using social media.  
 
4.2 Suggestion 
Based on the results of the analysis and conclusions above, the advice given to related parties is as follows: 
1. Netizen  
Netizens need to apply these three principles in using social media. In the principle of transparency, 
netizens can start by including evidence when uploading status and other activities on Facebook. 
Furthermore, netizens can contribute to the principle of accountability by not issuing scolding and 
swearing or saying harshly in status or comments on Facebook. While on the principle of participation, 
netizens can also contribute by sharing useful content owned by other users, such as interview tips, job 
vacancies, and others. By applying these principles, netizens will not be easily provoked by irresponsible 
elements to spread hoax news, hate speech, or other things that can harm themselves and others. 
Therefore, netizens must use social media wisely, which impacts creating a healthy social media 
environment. 
2. Ministry of Communication and Information (Ministry of Communication and Information) 
As the number of cases relating to social media in Indonesia increases, it is necessary to apply social 
media governance in the form of guidelines and quickly draft regulations that bind them. If not 
implemented immediately, these cases may have a widespread impact on the country's economy, 
security, and stability. Transparency, accountability, and participation can be used to make policies 
regarding social media governance to create wiser netizens. The creation of wise netizens will improve 
the good image of the Indonesian people in the eyes of the world. 
3. Researchers 
No less important advice is for readers interested in doing similar research. The next researcher is 
expected to be able to add the rule of law variable because the law is fundamental in governance, 
especially on social media. Readers and researchers further need to examine more deeply not only 
learning outcomes but it is recommended to examine other related variables. 
4. Facebook 
Suggestions for Facebook are developing new user-education policies in using their services and adding 
new features such as news fact-checking feature, breaking news feature, and others to minimize the 
spread of hoaxes, hate speech, etc. 
5. The people of Jakarta 
The public can support government policies by reminding each other about the good use of social media 
so that they are not easily provoked by unproven news on Facebook that may trigger undesirable events.

Abstract 
 
This research aimed to analyze the influence of net profit margin, book value, and firm size on the stock price of the 
manufacturing company sector consumer goods industry listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2015 to 
2017. The dependent variable of this study was the stock price. The independent variables were net profit margin, 
book value, and firm size. The statistical analysis tool used in this research was SPSS version 25. The samples in 
this research used the purposive sampling technique to get a sample size of 24 companies, and the number of 
observations is 72. Results of the research showed that net profit margin gives the effect towards stock price, book 
value gives the effect towards stock price, and the firm size gives the effect toward stock price. Net profit margin, 
book value, and firm size influence stock prices.

Net profit margin, book value, firm size, and stock price 
 
1. Introduction  
The stock price is an important factor that investors must consider when investing. Stock prices that are too low 
often mean that the company's performance is not good, but if the stock price is too high, it reduces the ability of 
investors to buy these shares (Tandelilin, 2010). Stock prices in the capital market are volatile. This is influenced by 
the strength of demand and supply. When the demand for a stock increase, the stock's price will tend to increase. 
Conversely, when more people sell the stock than people interested in buying it, the stock price will tend to decline. 
The existence of fluctuations in stock prices often makes stock investors act wrongly. Therefore, investors need 
sufficient and relevant information to analyze stock price movements. There are two types of stock analysis 
techniques: technical and fundamental analysis. Technical analysis is a way to analyze stocks by paying attention to 
price patterns and stock volumes. Fundamental analysis is a way to study stocks by estimating a company's ability to 
grow and generate profits in the future (Darmadji, 2011). 
 
Previous research shows there are differences in the results of the research conducted. Watung and Ilat's research 
results (2016) which examined the return on assets, net profit margins, and earnings per share of stock prices, stated 
that net profit margins affect stock prices. The results of this study differ from the research results of Hutapea, 
Saerang, and Tulung Subhan (2017), stating that the net profit margin does not affect stock prices. A previous study 
conducted by Malhotra and Tandon (2013) stated that book value positively affected stock prices. According to 
Andriyani and Armereo's research (2016), book value had a negative effect on stock prices. Anggraeni and Widjaja's 
(2017) research states that company size positively affects stock prices. The results of this study differ from the

2173","4.3 Effect of Company Size on Stock Price 
Based on the results of tests that have been conducted, it can be concluded that the size of the company has a 
positive and significant effect on stock prices in manufacturing companies in the consumer goods industry sector 
which are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2015-2017. This is indicated by the significance 
value of the company size, which is smaller than 0.05, which is 0,000. Therefore, the third hypothesis proposed in 
this study was accepted. 
 
Company size is a proxy for information asymmetry between the company and the market. Larger companies will 
have more assets. The greater the total assets, the more capital is invested, the more sales, the more money turnover, 
and the greater the market capitalization, the greater the company is known in the community. Signalling theory 
reveals how a company can give signals to users of financial statements. The company's management will signal to 
investors how the management views the company's prospects. Investors will tend to invest in large-sized companies 
hoping that they will get high profits. In addition, investors assume that large-sized companies will be more stable 
against changing economic conditions so that the company's prospects in the future are more reliable. 
 
The results of this study are in line with previous studies conducted by Anggraeni & Widjaja (2017: 108), which 
state that company size has a significant positive effect on stock prices. The company's large size shows that the 
company is superior in terms of wealth, has good performance, and is experiencing growth so that investors will 
respond positively, and the company's value will increase. The company's large size shows that the company has 
developed so that investors will respond positively, and the company's value will increase. This positive response 
from investors can make a company's stock price increase.  
 
But the results of this study are not in line with research conducted by Sa'adah & Kadarusman (2014: 27), where the 
results of his research are that company size does not affect stock prices. Sa'adah & Kadarusman (2014: 27) states in 
their research that larger companies have more assets, so they will tend to operate at the maximum level. Larger 
companies should have greater opportunities to maintain share prices and even increase their share prices in the 
market. This insignificant test result shows that company size is not informative enough to measure a company's 
performance. Investors assume that large companies can not always provide a large rate of return, and vice versa, 
small companies, do not rule out the possibility of providing high rates of return for their investors. 
 
6. Conclusion and Suggestion 
Based on the results of the data analysis and discussion explained in the previous chapter, several conclusions can be 
drawn as follows: 
1. The first hypothesis is accepted that the net profit margin positively affects the stock price. 
2. The second hypothesis is accepted that book value positively affects the stock price. 
3. The first hypothesis is accepted that company size positively affects the stock price. 
Research that has been done has limitations, i.e.: 
1. The sample used in this study is limited to manufacturing companies in the consumer goods industry sector. 
2. The period used in this study is only three years, namely 2015 to 2017. 
3. The independent variables used in this study are only three independent variables, namely net profit 
margin, book value, and company size. 
 
Based on the conclusions and limitations that have been explained before, then some suggestions can be given, i.e.: 
1. Based on tests that have been carried out, net profit margin, book value, and company size have a positive 
and significant effect on stock prices. In addition, the results of the F test conclude that the net profit 
margin, book value, and company size together influence the stock price, so investors should pay attention 
to these three variables when analyzing stocks and making investment decisions. 
2. The ability of independent variables to explain the dependent variable is 64.1% and 35.9% explained by 
factors other than the net profit margin, book value, and company size. Researchers can then use ratios that 
are likely to affect stock prices and help do fundamental analyses such as price to book value, debt to 
equity ratio, and earnings per share. Price to book value can provide information to prospective investors 
about the fair value of stock prices so that potential investors can find out whether the stock price that is 
currently outstanding is undervalued or overvalued. Earnings per share can help potential investors estimate 
the profits earned by investors per share they own. 
3. The next researcher is expected to use a broader research object and not only use the manufacturing 
companies in the consumer goods industry sector so that future studies can provide a more accurate picture

also expected to be able to extend the observation period so that he can know the company's past conditions 
as well as a description of the influence of the three variables in this study for the better.

Abstract  
 
This study aimed to analyze the influence of net working capital and ownership structure against company 
performance measured by economic value added (EVA). The research object was consumer goods companies listed 
on Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2016. The dependent variable of this study was company performance, 
and the independent variables were net working capital, managerial ownership, and foreign ownership. Statistical 
analysis tools used in this research were multiple linear regression and test using STATA for Windows version 12,4. 
The results show that variable concentration of foreign ownership significantly influences economic value-added 
while net working capital and managerial ownership did not significantly influence economic value added. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
Economic growth in the consumer goods sector in 3 years has become a positive market in Indonesia with an 
average growth of above 10%. Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US $ 3,500 surpasses 
competing countries in ASEAN, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, according to (Suwismo, 2016). Therefore, 
consumer goods industry companies must be able to manage their working capital well to continue to improve 
economic growth. Corporate cash is the main thing that the company maintains because of operational funding, 
meeting capital needs, investment considerations and payments. Short-term business requires short-term funds or 
working capital, while in the long run, the company has a goal to remain to stand and maintain the company's 
performance. One of the long-term financial investments is Working capital. Net working capital in the company 
that the company uses in its operations and business strategies to achieve maximum profit by minimizing debt 
lending and vice versa, increasing current asset income. If the net working capital results are negative or usually 
called a working capital deficit, the company is experiencing liquidity problems. According to (Marfuah, & 
Zulhilmi, 2015)companies with negative net working capital will generally create cash reserves, while companies 
with large net working capital will automatically reduce cash balances. The company's available capital must be 
enough to finance expenses or daily operations in the presence of efficiency and effectiveness of working capital. 
The company is expected to increase operating profits because the faster the working capital turnover, the sooner the 
working capital becomes cash. This is because investors take advantage of net working capital to find out the 
company's financial health when it conducts investment activities.

Table 3 outlines the test value of 0.0144. If the test value f<0.05, then the F Test accepts H1 at a significance level of 
5%, or that means all the independent variables simultaneously have a significant effect on the dependent variable. 
Therefore, the variables net working capital, managerial ownership, and foreign ownership affect the company's 
performance variables as measured by economic value added. 
 
3.2 T Test Results 
In Table 4, column t is a partial t-test value. It is said to be significant at the 5% level if in the right-hand column that 
is P> [t] or also called p-value/significance <0.05. Based on the results from Table 2, it is explained that P> | t | 
NWC (net working capital) and MOWN (managerial ownership) exceed 0.05, which is valued at 0.081 and 0.269. 
Therefore, the conclusion for this partial test is that the two variables accept Ho, while in FOWN (foreign 
ownership), it is explained that P> | t | smaller than 0.05, which is valued at 0.010. Thus, the foreign ownership 
variable is stated to reject Ho and is stated to be significant in accepting alternative hypotheses.

3.3 Regression Analysis Results 
Based on Table 4 above, multiple linear regression analysis in this study was conducted using net working capital 
(NWC), managerial ownership (MOWN) and managerial foreign (FOWN) as independent variables, company 
performance as the dependent variable. 
Y = 24,762 + 2,426 X1 + 0,819 X2 – 1,827 X3 + e 
 
4. Conclusion 
1. Net Working Capital has no significant effect on Company Performance. 
Table 1 outlines the companies GGRM, KLBF and WIIM in the three periods that continue to experience 
an increase in net working capital. In 2014 GGRM had an NWC of 0.253, in 2015 of 0.291 and in 2016 of 
0.322. In 2014 KLBF had an NWC of 0.461, in 2015 of 0.466, and in 2016 of 0.476. In 2014 WIIM had an 
NWC of 0.419, in 2015 of 0.481 and in 2016 of 0.519. So, this study stated the large proportion of net 
working capital means the company cannot manage working capital properly so that the company has 
decreased profitability. Therefore, EVA measurement tools which are stated as working capital 
measurement media, can give results that the company has not been significant in providing added value to 
the company. Under these circumstances, the hypothesis made by the researcher is supported by research 
conducted by (Anggarani D., &Ficilia, 2014). 
2. Managerial ownership does not significantly influence Company Performance. 
In Table 1, the data presented by the author are only 27 proportion of managerial ownership owned by the 
consumer goods sector of 78 with a total percentage of 49%. The lack of managerial ownership cannot be 
felt by the contribution of the manager's responsibility because not all profits obtained by the company can 
be enjoyed by management. This gives the possibility that there will be less than optimal management by 
management. Therefore, the results of the study are supported by research conducted by Vani (2017: 129) 
as well as the results of the study are also in line with research by (Wida, NP PD, 2014). So that the 
possibility of managerial ownership that was studied was also obtained with a small percentage so that the 
EVA carried out by management could not yet feel the benefits for the company. 
3. Foreign ownership has a significant positive effect on Company Performance. 
In Table 1, there are 37 samples that have foreign ownership, and in the percentage of foreign ownership, 
the average percentage owned by foreign parties is high. Therefore, the high percentage of foreign

and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022

2191","ownership in companies gives an illustration that foreign parties believe that the capital they invest can be 
played back so that it can provide more added value to them. This is evident from the increase in EVA, 
which increased for three years at ADES companies (Akasha Wira International Tbk in the amount of 
23.83, 23.88 and 24.13 and SQBB (Taisho Pharmaceutical Indonesia Tbk) by 24.97, 25.23 and 25,31 Then 
foreign ownership is one of the variables which is stated as a factor that can increase the company's added 
value and is in line with the research of Moez et al. In (Hartini, 2016) and research conducted by 
(Hermiyetti., &Katlanis, 2016) Foreign ownership contributes greatly to corporate decision making to 
improve company performance. Foreign owners are able to voice the interests of the owner widely if there 
are adverse management policies due to a conflict of interest between management and the owner. Foreign 
ownership also actively supervises the development of the company by making direct confirmation to the 
management of every action taken for the company. 
 
Suggestions to be conveyed for further research are as follows: 
1. Future studies are expected to use other data samples, such as companies engaged in other sectors. 
2. Future studies are expected to add a longer research period so that the influence of the net working capital 
mechanism and ownership structure on company performance can be felt like more than three periods.  
3. Future studies are expected to increase the number of ownership structures such as institutional ownership, 
public ownership, domestic ownership, and private ownership to compare ownership impacts that affect 
company performance.

Abstract 
 
The fast development of the internet nowadays attracts many companies to start using the internet to deliver 
information about company financial or nonfinancial information. Using the company website because of lower cost 
and pervasiveness. This study aims to determine the leverage ratio, profitability ratio, and listing age of banking 
companies listed on IDX 2013-2017. It significantly affects how banking companies use internet financial reporting. 
This study uses a statistic descriptive test, classic assumption test as normality test, multicollinear test, 
heteroscedasticity test, and autocorrelation test. The multiple linear regression and hypothesis tests, both partial t-test 
and simulant f-test are done using 127 samples from 27 banking companies. This study shows a significant effect on 
leverage, profitability, and listing age. For partial test from three variables shows that only listing age has a 
significant impact on internet financial reporting, profitability and leverage have no considerable effect on internet 
financial reporting.

1. Introduction 
At this time, many things can be done to meet the needs and carry out daily activities more easily thanks to the rapid 
development of technology today. The internet is one example of the features resulting from technology 
development. It is most often used by the community in daily activities and is already familiar in today's society 
(Rizqiah and Lubis 2017). The internet has become an essential part of the field of communication community today 
(Jones & Xiao, 2004; Hossain et al. 2012). Based on Internet World Stats (2018) data, Asia ranks top in internet 
usage globally. In this case, Asia takes a sizeable portion with a percentage value of 48.7%, which means Asia 
accounts for almost half of the world's internet users. 
 
The rapid development of technology has made the internet one of the new alternatives for companies to present 
information regarding the company, financially and non-financially (Prasetya and Irwandi 2012). Financial reporting 
via the internet or Internet Financial Reporting (IFR) refers to the use of company websites to disseminate 
information about the company's financial performance (Ruga et al. 2011). The increase in computer technology and 
the internet significantly influences the communication of financial statements in the world sees. Companies started 
reporting information relating to the company's business on the company's website page (Rozak 2012).The quick

4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
4.1 Conclusion 
This research has passed a series of tests to ensure the data used is appropriate as research material. A total of 127 
sample data consisting of 25 companies have passed the classic assumption test, test, and hypothesis test, so the 
results of the study are stated as follows. 
 
The independent variable of leverage is stated not to find empirical evidence that proves to have an influence on 
internet financial reporting with a positive coefficient value. If there is an increase in the leverage ratio, it increases 
the possibility for more disclosure to internet financial reporting. The results of this study are in line with previous 
studies conducted byMaharani (2017), Puri (2011), and Saher (2014). The independent variable of profitability is 
stated not to affect internet financial reporting with a positive coefficient value. If there is an increase in the 
profitability ratio, it increases the possibility for more disclosure to internet financial reporting. It is because the high 
value of profitability will make an investor and other outsiders put trust in the company. The results of this study are 
in line with previous studies conducted byMaharani (2017),Puri (2011). The age-independent variable of the listing 
is stated to have an influence on the internet financial reporting with a positive coefficient value. If there is an 
increase in the age ratio of the listing, it increases the possibility for more disclosure to internet financial reporting. 
The results of this study are in line with previous studies conducted by Chariti and Lestari (2007) and Maulida, 
Noor, & Nurul (2017).Due to the many experiences of companies that have a longer-lasting life. Hence, they are 
more aware of the completeness of any item. It will facilitate access to investors' and outsiders' needs. 
 
Simultaneous Significance Test Results 
The simultaneous significance test is conducted to find out how much influence the independent variable together on 
the dependent variable. In this test, if the probability value obtained has a value below 0.05 or 5%, then the 
conclusion is drawn that the independent variables used in research together influence the dependent variable.

1. There are several suggestions to develop this research, given to future researchers who are interested in 
researching this research topic. 
2. The results of the coefficient of determination obtained in this study indicate that other factors outside of the 
review affect the observed dependent variable. So that future research can make additions to the independent 
variables, such as block holder ownership, managerial ownership, assets in place, and business complexity. 
3. The amount of this research is limited because the investigation conducts only on the object of banking 
company research. Further research studies conclude on companies whose sample values are higher such as 
manufacturing companies. 
4. Conduct discussions on the use of internet financial reporting on companies that have not been listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX).

Abstract 
 
Wildfires represent both ecological and economic disasters that significantly affect our planet. The traditional tools to 
detect fires are not useful in large open areas such as forests. Currently, there is limited work to provide intelligent 
tools that can assist in understanding, detecting, fighting, or predicting wildfires. Recently, there has been some 
initiatives to develop such capabilities. However, these initiatives are in the early stage and additional contributions 
are needed. Our work, using Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition techniques, presents an initial attempt in 
developing a model that is capable of autonomously recognizing wildfires, determining their size and intensity, and 
making some prediction about their potential spread. Our initial model is based on convolutional neural networks and 
utilize images collected from NASA’s website combined with the Meteostat library to create a spatiotemporal 
composite data set. The data include—but not limited to—positional data, fire temperature from the ti4 and ti5 sensors, 
fire radiative power, and the timestamp information. This data is used to determine the areas in which the fires are 
burning, along with the strength of the fires, which will eventually allow the system to determine the spread of 
wildfires. We also hope that this project will increase the awareness of this important problem.

Abstract 
Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is one important part of the economy of a country or region. This 
important role has encouraged many countries, including Indonesia, to continue working to develop SMEs. This is 
because MSMEs have contributed more than half of Indonesia's GDP, and MSMEs and the largest employer 
absorber for Indonesia. MSMEs also have a business unit of 99.9% of the total business units compared to large 
enterprises. Therefore, why MSMEs have become the backbone of the Indonesian economy, especially in the Food 
and Beverage industry sector, see the contribution of the food and beverage industry to the total GDP of Indonesia. 
However, SMEs today are still often getting problems and obstacles in the Indonesian industry. One of them is the 
lack of knowledge about entrepreneurship that hampers the development of a business and the emergence of 
innovation. The purpose of this study is to determine the variables that affect innovation to improve the 
competitiveness of SMEs. This study uses the application of the method of Structural Equation Modeling - Partial 
Least Squares (SEM-PLS). The type of research used is descriptive research with a time horizon used is cross-
sectional for once data collection in micro industries that are part of MSMEs. The results of this study are expected 
to show what variables can be related to and influence entrepreneurship and trigger the innovation of Indonesian 
SMEs, whose audiences become the driving force of the national economy.

 4.1 Suggestions  
To enhance cooperation, business actors must be able to see the nature and behavior of other business actors in 
carrying out their duties and developments. Business practitioners should make centralized decisions only in certain 
situations to determine the company's future. Businesses must be more open to information about products, markets, 
and technology. Businesses must collaborate and communicate more with each employee to establish a harmonious 
influence within one company and prioritize the concept of Collective in problem-solving and finding solutions.

 This research still has some limitations, but it provides an opportunity for further research. This research was 
conducted using a micro business sample in Jakarta's food and beverages. Different societal environments will 
provide different views as well. Therefore, it is recommended that further research be carried out using a wider and 
more diverse sample in the business.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to determine the factors influencing the level of IPO Underpricing on companies listed on the 
Indonesian stock exchange from 2015 to 2017. Variables examined include Return on asset, firm age, financial 
leverage, number of shares offered, and auditor reputation. This research is carried out by analyzing multiple 
regression with a 5% significance level. Observation and literature study with purposive sampling is used as the data 
collection method. The study concluded that ROA and the number of shares offered show a significant positive effect 
on underpricing. Firm age, financial leverage, and auditor reputation do not significantly influence underpricing.

1. Introduction                                                     
Economic development supported by the advancement of communication and technology has created very tight 
competition in almost every business sector. Many companies compete with each other to expand their scope of 
business. To survive, a company must continue to grow and make a new development. Many business owners think 
of doing global expansion in line with global economic development that keeps growing up.  
 
Stock issuance in the capital market has become an alternative for companies to get additional funds for business 
expansion. The additional capital will be used for the development of the business operation. Not only for 
companies, but the capital market has also become one of the alternatives for the investor in investing in various 
types of businesses. This has also become the investor's opportunity to get a bigger initial return, the result that the 
investor got from the investment, from the investing activities. 
 
The initial public offering is the term used for a process when a company first sells its stock to the public in the 
primary market and becomes a publicly traded company. According to the law of the Republic of Indonesia, Act. No 
8 the year 1995 about the Capital Market, the definition of going public is the activity of offering shares by the issuer 
company to the public based on the procedure set by the law of Capital Market. 
 
Once a company decides to go public, the company must sell its shares in the primary market at a price that has been 
determined by the help of the underwriter. This activity is called Initial Public Offering (IPO). Then, after being 
traded in the primary market, the issuer's shares will be traded in the secondary market. The price of the shares is 
formed by the supply and demand of the investors. 
 
Besides the advantages of going public, IPO also raises a problem for the issuer. When a company prepares to go 
public, the problem faced is determining the first price. The issuer wants to set a high price to gain a high return from 
the initial offering, but on the other side, the high price of shares will lessen the investor's interest in buying the

2214","in opposite directions as the lower ROA will increase the underpricing level, and the higher ROA will decrease the 
underpricing level. 
The significant negative influence of ROA on underpricing level might happen for various reasons. One of the causes 
is that investors have more interest in companies with high Return on Asset. ROA itself is the financial ratio that 
shows the percentage of profit a company earned in a year with the overall asset and resources. The higher the ROA, 
the more effective a company uses its assets to gain profit. The high level of ROA also becomes a piece of evidence 
that the company can manage the capital efficiently, which results in future income. This phenomenon will reduce 
the uncertainty of future events and decrease the risk of investment. The lower level of uncertainty will reduce the 
underpricing level as it affects the decision making of the investors. Thus, the significant negative result shows an 
inverse relationship between two variables as the higher the ROA, the lesser the underpricing and vice versa. 
 
3.6 The Influence of Firm Age towards Underpricing 
According to the t-test, firm age has no significant influence on underpricing. The result can be seen in the table 
above. The significant value is 0.079, and the coefficient of -0.005. Therefore, the significance value of firm age is 
greater than the significance level of 0.05 (0.079 > 0.05). Therefore, according to the decision criteria, H0 cannot be 
rejected, and it means that the firm age does not significantly influence the underpricing level of IPO companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) within the period 2015 to 2017.  
 
The age of the companies is not influencing the level of underpricing because investors do not concern about how 
long a company has been established. The older companies do not reduce the uncertainty of initial Returns. The older 
companies cannot ensure the good prospect of the issues. Also, younger companies do not necessarily show a bad 
prospect of the issues. The age of the companies cannot be the evidence that older companies can reduce the risk of 
future investment as the firm age cannot be the proxy of firm quality. Younger companies are not always riskier than 
older companies. Investors are more interested in analyzing the financial factors rather than the company's age. Due 
to that reason, age is not becoming the factor determining the degree of Return. Companies of any age can 
experience unhealthy financial conditions or even have the possibility of bankruptcy. Thus, the company's age is not 
the consideration of investors in assessing the value of issues. 
 
3.7 The Influence of Financial Leverage towards Underpricing 
According to the t-test, financial leverage has no significant influence. The influence shown in Table 6 has a 
significance value of 0.068 and a coefficient of -0.136. The significance value of financial leverage is greater than 
the significance level of 0.05 (0.068 > 0.05). Therefore, H0 is not rejected, and H1 is rejected according to the 
criteria.  
 
The result shows that financial leverage does not significantly influence the underpricing level in IPO companies 
listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2015 to 2017.  
 
Financial leverage does not significantly influence underpricing because investors are not concerned about the level 
of leverage. Leverage can be both good and bad. It depends on the investment made by the company. If used 
successfully, leverage can be very advantageous for the company as they can use the fund from the debt to buy more 
assets to improve production and profit. On the other hand, financial leverage also comes with the risk of loss and 
bankruptcy if not well managed by the management. Thus, based on the research result, financial leverage is not a 
consideration for investors to invest in a company, and investors do not seem to view financial leverage as a relevant 
factor in determining the company's future. 
 
3.8 The Influence of Number of Shares Offered towards Underpricing 
Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the number of shares offered in IPO has a 
significant negative influence on underpricing. The conclusion is made by looking at the coefficient of -0.062 and the 
significance level of 0.044. The significance value is lower than 0.05 (0.044 < 0.05), so it can be concluded that the 
number of shares issues significantly influences the level of underpricing. The coefficient of -0.062 shows the 
negative direction from this variable towards underpricing. The significant negative effect shows an inverse 
correlation between the number of shares offered and the underpricing level. The number of shares offered and 
underpricing level move in opposite directions as the smaller the offering size will increase the underpricing level, 
and the larger the offering size will decrease the underpricing level. 
 
A large number of shares sold to the secondary market will affect the decision of the investor to purchase the shares

The ability of all variables to explain the underpricing level is 21.8%. The remaining 78.2% is determined 
by other variables not identified in this study. This result is obtained from the R-squared test conducted in the 
previous chapter. The result shows the adjusted R-squared of 0.218 or 21.8%, as shown in Table 7 
3. 
Return on the asset, the age of the firm, financial leverage, numbers of shares issued, and auditor reputation 
simultaneously affect underpricing of companies that conducted IPO from 2015 to 2017. This result can be seen 
from F-test in table 8. The test result shows that the significance value of the F-test is less than 0.05 (0.003 < 0.05). 
This research has provided a deeper knowledge for the researcher of the capital market, especially related to initial 
public offerings in Indonesia. The advice given to researchers is to expand the range of the observation, such as using 
stock exchanges from other countries or other financial or non-financial variables not mentioned in this study.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to identify the factors that affect the decision to apply accounting conservatism. The factors used are 
profitability, investment opportunity set, and debt covenant. The main goal of this study is to determine whether the 
level of profitability, investment opportunity set, and debt covenant affect management's decision to apply a 
conservative principle in the accounting method. The objects of this study are the consumer goods companies listed 
on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, with an observation period of 3 years, ranging from 2014 to 2016. This study 
concluded that profitability, investment opportunity set, and debt covenant simultaneously affect accounting 
conservatism. The variable profitability has a significant positive effect on accounting conservatism, while variables 
investment opportunity set, and debt covenant has no significant effect on accounting conservatism.

1. Introduction 
Along with globalization, the economic sector of trade and technology will certainly develop rapidly. With the 
development of the economic sector, which is fundamental to a country, surely it is necessary to have adequate 
supervision of the situation or financial condition of the industry. Financial Reports published annually by 
companies listed on the Stock Exchange are one of the supervisory tools that can provide investors with a reference 
for decision-making and forecasting. Financial statements are records of company financial information in an 
accounting period, which are used to describe the situation or performance of the company or can also be interpreted 
with a record of financial information neatly compiled by the company to evaluate the company's performance, 
which is useful to meet the parties who use it. One of the main concerns in financial reporting is earnings 
information, which provides data on a company's financial performance during a certain period. Accounting 
principles are needed to produce relevant and reliable figures to realize these benefits. 
 
One of the principles adopted in the financial reporting process is the principle of conservatism. The principle of 
conservatism in accounting itself faces several pros and cons. This principle prioritizes prudence in recording, so 
using this principle is considered important because the financial statements can reflect the company's actual 
financial condition because the data recorded must have the certainty to avoid conflicts of interest between 
management and shareholders. On the other hand, this principle is considered to affect the quality of financial 
statements to be biased. Penman and Zhang in Enni Savitri (2016) estimate that conservatism results in lower 
earnings quality and is less relevant. Conservatism affects the quality of the figures reported on the balance sheet

2223","The results of the study are in accordance with research conducted by Dwitayanti and Fahlevi (2015) and Andreas, 
Ardeni, and Nugroho (2017). According to Aggrawal and Kyaw (2006) in Andreas, Ardeni, and Nugroho (2017), 
IOS is a number that shows the level of growth (growth opportunity) owned by a company. A high level of sales 
growth often increases market expectations of future cash flows so that management will apply the principles of 
conservatism accounting. The higher the IOS value, which indicates the company's growth rate, the higher the 
accounting conservatism applied by the company. 
 
However, the results of this study are not in accordance with the research conducted by Saputri (2013), which 
concluded that the investment opportunity set has a significant influence on accounting conservatism. This is 
because companies that have good growth rates can attract investors, so the choice of companies in investing 
through assets, which will affect the company's growth, has a large influence on management policies in applying 
conservative accounting principles. 
 
3.4.3 The Effect of Debt Covenant on Accounting Conservatism 
The third hypothesis in this study is that debt covenants have a significant effect on accounting conservatism. The 
debt covenant in this study was measured using the Debt to Asset Ratio (DAR). In the previous hypothesis test 
results table, the debt covenant variable has a coefficient value of .290 and a value of 1.518 with a significance value 
of .134. The significance value is greater than the α value used, which is 0.05, so the debt covenant variable does not 
have a significant effect on the dependent variable of accounting conservatism. Thus, the H3 of this study, namely 
debt covenant has a significant effect on accounting conservatism, is rejected. 
 
The use of debt as a source of corporate funds is something we will always find. But companies that have gone 
public by issuing their shares on the stock exchange also get funds through the issuance of these shares. Stocks are 
considered to have a smaller risk compared to debt contracts. With the source of funds through these investors, debt 
agreements owned by the company will not be too influential in the implementation of conservative accounting. 
 
The results of the study are in accordance with research conducted by Ayuningsih, Nurcholisah, and Helliana(2018), 
which said that the company did not have a significant influence. Jayanti and Sapari(2016) conclude in their 
research that the higher the level of debt owned by the company, the greater the possibility of management doing 
earnings management because to collect loan funds, the debtor must provide a guarantee to the creditor that the debt 
obligations can be paid off in the future. Therefore, the management can manipulate the value of earnings to 
improve the performance of the company in the eyes of the debtor, so the company can increase the likelihood of 
getting a loan. 
 
However, the results of this study are not in accordance with the research conducted by Sari, Yusralaini, and Al-
Azhar (2014), which concluded that debt covenants have a significant influence on the application of accounting 
conservatism. This can be explained by the fact that debt covenants are the company's preferred source of funds, but 
a debt agreement generally has certain conditions determined by creditors, so the choice to make a debt contract can 
affect company policy in applying conservative accounting. 
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
4.1 Conclusions 
Based on the results of statistical tests conducted, it can be concluded that the profitability variable has a significant 
effect on accounting conservatism, while the investment opportunity set, and debt covenant variables do not have a 
significant effect on the accounting conservatism variable. The variable profitability and investment opportunity set 
have a negative effect, while the debt covenant variable has a positive effect. These variables also have an effect of 
26.9% in explaining variations in accounting conservatism variables. 
 
4.2 Suggestion 
Based on the results obtained from the study, investors can be careful in investing by looking at profitability as the 
main benchmark in predicting whether accounting conservatism has been carried out by companies. Creditors can 
also see profitability as a reference in providing loans to determine if the company has carried out conservative 
accounting principles and recorded profits to describe the actual financial situation, so the company can return the 
investment given by creditors. In addition, this research company can be included as well as a reference in 
considering the policies for preparing conservative accounting methods in the proper financial statements. This

better to use other variables such as leverage, firm size, managerial ownership, institutional ownership, etc., as well 
as using a proxy for accrual accounting conservatism or stock return relations.

Abstract  
 
This research aims to test the influence of the corporate social responsibility, Chief Financial Officer gender, and 
majority firm toward tax aggressiveness listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2013-2016. The sample 
collection technique has been done using purposive sampling, and 11 samples of firms have met the stated criteria. 
This research shows that corporate social responsibility has a negative effect on tax aggressiveness. It means that if 
the corporate social responsibility disclosure rate is low, then the tax aggressiveness rate on that firm is relatively 
high. On the other side, the Chief Financial Officer's gender and the majority of firms do not influence the tax 
aggressiveness.

1. Introduction 
Tax is the biggest source of income for the country. According to Purwanggono and Rohman (2015), the tax for the 
company itself is calculated through the company's net income in the income statement in its financial statements. 
Taxes are considered costs that will reduce company profits and reduce net income (Sari, 2017). By taking a tax 
reduction action, the company's burden will become smaller to increase the company's profit. This will certainly 
benefit the company because it can maximize its profits. Therefore, it encourages companies to be aggressive in 
taxation. 
 
Tax aggressiveness refers to the most extreme part of tax avoidance activities, and according to Hanlon and 
Heitzman (2010), it is an action that can suppress the tax law as much as possible (Francis, 2014). Although not an 
act contrary to law, tax aggressiveness will always be associated with tax avoidance (tax avoidance) and tax evasion 
(tax evasion). Not all taxpayers who are aggressive towards taxation carry out tax evasion, but all taxpayers who 
carry out tax evasion are certainly aggressive towards taxes. Therefore, according to Balakrishnan, Blouin, and Guay 
(2011), tax-aggressive companies are characterized by lower transparency.  
 
The relationship between CSR disclosure and tax aggressiveness lies in the company's main objective to obtain 
maximum profit without eliminating social and environmental responsibility. The greater the company's profit, the 
greater the taxable income (Jessica and Toly, 2014). 
 
Companies are involved in tax planning to reduce the tax burden (Balakrishnan et al., 2011). One of the parties who 
contribute to making decisions about the company's sustainability is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or 
commonly referred to as the Finance Director. As an official in the top position of the company's chain, the CEO 
plays a very important role so that the company can continue for a long time and make a large profit. In addition to

2234","3.3 Effect of Majority Ownership on Tax Aggressiveness 
The results of research with the independent variable majority ownership (FAM) have a p-value of 0.9448 which 
means it is greater than 0.05 with a coefficient value of -0.000937. This proves that the FAM variable does not 
influence tax aggressiveness. In other words, H3 is rejected. 
 
The results of this study are not in line with research conducted by Purwanggono&Rohman (2015), which states that 
the majority ownership variable (FAM) has a negative effect on tax aggressiveness. Companies with a greater 
proportion of share ownership owned by non-public and family companies will report lower ETR. This happens 
because the majority of shareholders who also have control over the company will be more careful of their business 
behaviour to not harm themselves. 
 
The majority of ownership itself indicates ownership of shares above 50%. There are various forms of share 
ownership structure, one of which is managerial ownership. According to Hadi&Mangoting (2014), it can be 
concluded that managerial ownership does not affect tax aggressiveness. This result states that managerial 
ownership in a company does not influence managers to carry out tax aggressiveness. In addition, Faizah 
&Adhivinna's (2017) research with institutional ownership as one of the variables states that institutional ownership 
does not affect tax avoidance. Institutional owners, based on the size and voting rights owned, have an incentive to 
ensure that management makes decisions that can maximize the welfare of institutional shareholders so that it only 
focuses on earnings management.  
 
This study uses one control variable, the company size variable (SIZE). The company size control variable (SIZE) in 
table 10 shows a p-value of 0.0019, which is smaller than 0.05. This indicates that SIZE influences tax 
aggressiveness. In addition, the SIZE variable has a coefficient value of -0.011408, which indicates that SIZE has a 
negative effect on ETR but has a positive effect on tax aggressiveness. It can be concluded that the larger the 
company's size, the higher the level of tax aggressiveness. 
 
The results of this study differ from the results of research conducted by Purwanggono (2015). In the study results, it 
is known that SIZE has a significance level of 0.151 which means above 0.05. Therefore, the SIZE variable is 
considered to not influence tax aggressiveness.  
In contrast to the results of research by Purwanggono, the results of research conducted by Kuriah (2015) stated that 
SIZE has a positive influence on tax aggressiveness. This shows that the higher the size of the company, the higher 
the tax aggressiveness of the company. The larger the company's size, the company can use its resources (assets). 
Companies with large categories can pay more tax experts to manage taxes. In addition, the greater the company's 
total assets indicate the size of the company is complex, the transactions will be more complex. This allows 
companies to take advantage of existing loopholes to transfer profits to companies in other countries (Dewi and Jati 
in Hadi and Mangoting, 2014). 
 
4. Conclusion 
Based on the data that has been collected to obtain 11 companies with a total sample of 44 pieces, the conclusions 
can be drawn from this study, i.e.:  
1. The variable Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in trading and service companies from 2013 to 2016 
has a p-value of 0.0361 which means it is smaller than α = 0.05, indicating that CSR influences tax 
aggressiveness, while the coefficient value on the number 0.177957 shows that CSR has a positive effect 
on ETR, but has a negative effect on tax aggressiveness. High CSR disclosure figures indicate that the 
company cares and pays attention to environmental and social conditions in carrying out its operational 
activities. Companies that are aggressive towards taxes have relatively low transparency. Therefore, 
companies that disclose large amounts of CSR should pay taxes properly. In other words, H1 can be 
accepted. 
2. The gender variable Chief Financial Officer (POST) in trading and service companies from 2013 to 2016 
has a p-value of 0.1324 which means it is greater than α = 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0.017843, 
indicating that POST does not influence tax aggressiveness. In previous studies, it can be concluded that 
gender does not affect tax compliance and tax morals. In this study, both men and women have the same 
treatment of tax aggressiveness. In other words, H2 is rejected. 
3. The majority ownership variable (FAM) in trading and service companies from 2013 to 2016 has a p-value 
of 0.9448 which means it is greater than α = 0.05 with a coefficient of -0,000937, indicating that FAM does

2241","not influence tax aggressiveness. Companies owned by the majority and minority do not have different 
attitudes towards tax aggressiveness. In other words, H3 is rejected. 
4. The three independent variables, namely Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Gender Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO), and Majority Ownership, have a Prob (F-statistic) of 0,000591, which means greater than 
0.05 indicates that the three independent variables have influence together with Tax Aggressiveness. In 
other words, H4 can be accepted. 
5. The company size control variable (SIZE) in trade and service companies from 2013 to 2016 has a p-value 
of 0.0019 which means it is smaller than α = 0.05, indicating that SIZE influences tax aggressiveness, while 
the coefficient value in figure -0,011408 shows that SIZE has a negative effect on ETR, but has a positive 
effect on tax aggressiveness. The larger the company, the higher the company's complexity, so there can be 
various kinds of gaps in carrying out tax aggressiveness. For example, suppose the company has an 
overseas branch or subsidiary with a low tax rate. In that case, the company can use the gap to transfer 
earnings to the overseas branch or subsidiary. It can be concluded that companies with large sizes are more 
prone to be aggressive towards tax. In other words, H5 can be accepted. 
 
Limitation 
This study does not escape from several limitations, i.e.: 
1. Limited information regarding the Corporate Social Responsibility Report carried out by the company in 
the Financial Statements. 
2. The study was only four years with three independent variables, so the research conducted could not 
provide maximum results. 
 
Suggestion 
After conducting this research and reviewing the limitations faced by researchers, then the advice given is as 
follows: 
1. Government 
The results showed that CSR negatively affected tax aggressiveness. This shows that the lower the CSR disclosure 
rate, the greater the level of tax aggressiveness. In addition, the results of the study also showed that company size 
had a positive effect on tax aggressiveness. This indicates that the larger the company's size, the company will be 
more vulnerable to tax aggressiveness. It is recommended that the government pay more attention to companies with 
a low level of CSR disclosure with large company sizes to minimize the possibility of tax aggressiveness by 
companies. 
 
2. Investors 
The results showed that CSR negatively affected tax aggressiveness. This shows that the lower the CSR disclosure 
rate, the greater the level of tax aggressiveness. In addition, the results of the study also showed that company size 
had a positive effect on tax aggressiveness. This indicates that the larger the company's size, the company will be 
more vulnerable to tax aggressiveness. Investors are advised to reconsider when investing their shares in companies 
with a low level of CSR disclosure with a large company size because these companies tend to be aggressive 
towards tax. Companies that are too aggressive towards taxes cannot be said to be good companies to invest in. That 
is because the risk of companies dealing with tax problems will be even greater, and the company's image can 
decline. 
 
3. Author 
For the writer, it is suggested that further research can be considered to increase the research period to more than 
four years and try to examine companies in other sectors outside of trade and services to obtain more valid research 
results.

This study aims to determine the effect of suppliers, internal and customer integration on the supply chain 
performance moderated by the demand uncertainty at PT XYZ. This study uses quantitative research methods to 
collect data using questionnaires with a sample number of 38 using saturated sampling techniques. Data analysis 
with SEM-PLS with WarpPLS 6.0 software. The results of this research are suppliers of integration that directly 
influence the performance of the supply chain, in addition to the integration of suppliers and customers that 
influence the performance of the supply chain, measured against the demand uncertainty. The results of this survey 
indicate that managers need to improve the integration of suppliers and customers to improve the performance of the 
supply chain.

1. Introduction 
The distributor industry is undergoing rapid change, where distributors have enormous challenges and opportunities. 
Nowadays, many distributors must face changes in the digital age. In this digital age, distributor companies that do 
not adapt to take advantage of situations and opportunities will experience backwardness over time. Distributor 
companies are required to build and create proper supply chain management. According to Van Der Vaart in Alfalla, 
Marin and Medina (2014), effective supply chain management is a source of potentially sustainable competitive 
advantage for organizations. Supply chain integration plays an important role in this regard. Flynn et al. in Ganbold 
and Matsui (2017) stated that supply chain integration covers three dimensions: internal integration, supplier 
integration, and customer integration. Van Den Vaart et al. in Yu, Jacob, Salisbury, and Enns (2013) suggested that

2244","Based on Table 3, several values such as APC, ARS, and AVIF have fulfilled the requirements criteria, while the 
AARS does not meet the requirements criteria (figure 3 and table 4). 
 
From these six hypotheses, the analysis for the hypothesis test was tested with a significance level of 5% (Kock, 
2017). The test results of hypothesis 1 showed that the p-value of 0.004 ≤ 0.05 (Ho is rejected). This shows that 
supplier integration has a positive effect on supply chain performance, while the effect size is included in the weak 
category of only 7.4%, which indicates that supplier integration on supply chain performance has a weak influence. 
The results of the hypothesis 2 test show that the p-value of 0.455 ≥ 0.05 (Ho is accepted). This shows that internal 
integration does not affect supply chain performance. The results of the hypothesis 3 test indicate that the p-value of 
0.067 ≥ 0.05 (Ho is accepted). This shows that customer integration does not affect supply chain performance. The 
results of hypothesis test 4 show that the p-value of 0.001 ≤ 0.05 (Ho Rejected), this shows that supplier integration 
negatively affects supply chain performance, which is moderated by demand uncertainty, while the effect size value 
is included in the weak category of only 11, 6% which indicates that supplier integration on supply chain 
performance has a weak influence. The test result of hypothesis 5 indicates that the p-value of 0.110 ≥ 0.05 (Ho is 
accepted). This shows that internal integration does not influence supply chain performance. The test result of 
hypothesis 6 shows that the p-value of <0.001 ≤ 0.05 (Ho is Rejected) (Table 5). This shows that customer 
integration has a positive effect on supply chain performance moderated by demand uncertainty, while the effect 
size is included in the weak category of only 21.0%, which indicates that supplier integration on supply chain 
performance has a medium influence. In this study, the results of hypothesis testing where in hypotheses 1, 4, and 6 
found that these hypotheses are in line with previous studies (Yu, Jacob, Salisbury and Enns, 2013; Ding, Lu and 
Fan, 2017). However, the results of hypothesis testing 2, 3, and 5 showed no influence. This is not in line with 
previous research conducted by Alfalla, Marin, and Medina (2014) and Huo, Qi, Wang, and Zhao (2014). The 
absence of influence in the results of testing hypotheses 2, 3, and 5, which is different from previous research, can 
be due to: the supply chain integration does not have the same impact on performance depending on the country, 
industry, and product complexity (Alfalla, Marin, and Medina, 2014).

Based on Table 5, the construct variability of supplier integration, internal, and customer integration moderated by 
the uncertainty of demand can explain the diversity of supply chain performance variables by 19.7%. Then, 80.3% is 
explained by other factors not examined in this research. Q2 value for supplier integration, internal integration, and 
customer integration, moderated by the demand uncertainty for supply chain performance, is 0.042. This value 
indicates the ability of the model to predict values of 4.2%. Both results show good predictive validity because it has 
a value of more than 0. So, supplier integration, internal integration, and customer integration moderated by demand 
uncertainty can predict supply chain performance variables. 
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestions 
Based on the analysis results of the analysis, supplier integration influences supply chain performances in PT. XYZ. 
It means that the better the relationship with the supplier will improve the performance of the supply chain at PT 
XYZ. Then, internal integration and customer integration do not influence supply chain performance. This means 
that internal integration cannot improve supply chain performance. Supplier integration and customer integration 
affect supply chain performance, which is moderated by the uncertainty of demand at PT XYZ. This means that the 
better the integration of suppliers and customer integration the stronger demand uncertainty will further improve the 
performance of the supply chain, internal integration does not influences supply chain performance which is 
moderated by demand uncertainty at PT XYZ. This means that internal integration, which is moderated by demand 
uncertainty in this study, cannot improve supply chain performance. 
 
Based on the results of the study, discussion, and conclusion, some suggestions can be concluded that the integration 
of suppliers that affect the performance of the supply chain. The company should be able to maintain good relations

activities with company partners through information sharing and joint planning to accommodate end customer 
demand, supplier integration which has an influence on supply chain performance that is moderated by demand 
uncertainty, the company should continue to maintain good relations and communication with suppliers to be able to 
act quickly in the receipt of erratic orders, customer integration affects the performance of the supply chain which is 
moderated by demand uncertainty, the company should continue to improve relations between companies and 
customers and improve services in the receipt of orders that are always changing or uncertain, internal integration of 
supply chain performance, customer integration of supply chain performance, and internal integration of supply 
chain performance that is moderated by demand uncertainty has no effect. For further research, can use other 
variables that might influence the practice of supply chain integration, and suggestions for future research can use 
other variables besides SCI that affect the supply chain performance. Also considering that in this study there are 
limitations in the number of samples because they are only done in one company, so for further research can be done 
by increasing the number of companies to increase the number of samples or respondents.

Abstract 
 
This study and research aim to determine the effect of work environment, work motivation, and transformational 
leadership on employee performance at PT. XYZ. The research method is quantitative with this type of associative 
and descriptive research. The data analysis technique used is multiple regression analysis. This study was conducted 
on 153 employees out of 247 employees. The result of existing research shows no significant effect of the work 
environment on employee performance. Also found that there has no significant effect on work motivation towards 
employee performance. Furthermore, there is a significant effect between transformational leadership towards 
employee performance. So, the conclusion is the work environment and work motivation in PT. XYZ has no 
significant effect on employee performance and transformational leadership in PT. XYZ has a significant effect on 
employee performance. But, work environment, work motivation and transformational leadership simultaneously 
have a positive and significant influence on employee performance of 34,9%.

1. Introduction 
In facing competition in the global era, companies must work more efficiently and effectively. Increasing 
competition causes companies to be demanded to increase competitiveness to maintain the company's survival. One 
of the most important aspects that support and hold the key to an organization's success in achieving the company's 
planned goals in carrying out its production process is the aspect of human resources. To achieve optimal 
organizational goals, quality resources are needed in accordance with organizational conditions and an ever-
changing environment. The things companies can do to achieve these goals by improve the quality of human

6.1 Conclusions 
The work environment is at a good level, Work Motivation is at a high level, Transformational Leadership is at a 
good level, and Employee Performance is at a good level. 
There is no significant effect between the Work Environment on Employee Performance at PT. XYZ.

There is a significant influence between the Work Environment, Work Motivation and Transformational Leadership 
simultaneously on employee performance at PT. XYZ. 
 
6.2 Suggestions 
Since the work environment variable does not significantly influence employee performance, the company does not 
need to make efforts to improve or pay attention to it. Because employee performance will not improve if only the 
work environment is improved, it is better to do it together with other factors. 
 
Since work motivation does not significantly influence employee performance, the company does not need to make

environment is improved, it is better to do it together with other factors. 
 
Considering that transformational leadership variables have a significant effect on employee performance, it is 
suggested that company leaders should communicate persuasively to their employees, pay direct attention to 
employees, put themselves in problems that are considered difficult by employees and give employees free opinions. 
Something that can provide positive input for leaders and for the company itself. 
 
To improve employee performance, leaders should provide jobs in accordance with the abilities of each employee 
because each employee has different abilities and provides training that is to support the work. Thus, the employees 
can do their work optimally.

Abstract 
Creating a robust curriculum is key to ensuring success in an academic degree. This paper provides insight into the 
use of data science tools to enhance curriculum mapping in higher education. Using course learning outcomes and 
program (degree) learning outcomes, a network map is produced to ensure synthesized outcomes that can allow for 
great success of a program and enforce student education. Based off this project, different departments and universities 
can obtain insightful information about their own curriculum and how successful their curriculum mapping is. Students 
can also benefit from seeing the way course learning outcomes map to their program learning outcomes which could 
guide them through their studies and future careers.

1. Introduction 
Higher education curriculum development is always changing. Universities are faced with new courses, new ways of 
teaching, and new technologies that only make maintaining a successful curriculum nearly impossible without 
evaluating how courses map to the overall program objectives. Students are always trying to stay on track to finish 
their degrees and maintain knowledge of new technologies, so they can succeed in their future careers. Students rarely 
have any idea of what is expected of them in a course until they get to the end of the course and take a final exam. By 
having an interactive tool that maps specific details about a course and how it relates to the overall program learning 
outcomes (PLO’s), it would allow faculty and students to learn more about the degree program and get insight on 
specific details. Faculty can ensure that courses cover all objectives and outcomes needed for a successful degree. 
When creating a course, faculty also can see if course learning outcomes are mapped to program learning outcomes 
and is not just a filler course that does not entail content that relates to the overall degree. Visualizing the way the 
content of a course, in any given degree program, is being mapped to their course learning outcomes (CLO’s), faculty 
and students can get a better understanding of the course and can ensure greater knowledge of the contents discussed 
in the course. This would also allow students to familiarize themselves with topics and can see how these course 
learning outcomes can help them in the future. 
This paper presents the concept of using a network modeling tool with text data from the undergraduate Data Science 
(DS) curriculum at Florida Polytechnic University as a use case. The DS Curriculum ensures that students, the future 
data scientists, develop mathematical models, computational methods and tools for exploring, analyzing and making 
predictions from data. That they ask appropriate questions about data and interpret the predictions based on their 
expertise of the subject domain (Florida Poly Degree Program: Bachelor of Science, Data Science). With wanting to 
ensure great success for students, mapping the specific course learning outcomes of each core course in the DS 
program to the program learning outcomes of the entire DS program helps visualize how each course has an impact 
on the degree being achieved and can allow for great student success. For the analysis considered in this work, the newly 
developed  ABET learning outcomes for Data Science were used (Criteria for Accrediting Computing Programs, 2021-
2022). They are as follows: 
1. Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines 
to identify solutions. 
2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements 
in the context of the program’s discipline. 
3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.

4.8. Discussion 
While working on this project, there were a couple of things that stood out. The first major one was that not all course 
learning outcomes had a Bloom’s Taxonomy Level for it. This means that there was no word that was found in the 
description of the CLO that matched with a Bloom Level and that it most likely needs to be worded better. By wording 
it better and using the Bloom words, faculty are providing a better opportunity for a student to understand what level 
they are at in terms of thinking skills. This also would allow for faculty to understand and ensure that lower-level 
courses and higher-level courses are being evaluated at the correct Bloom Level. 
Additionally, applying this tool to a department gives lots of insight into the courses being offered. The flow of a 
degree program is key to ensuring success and that all starts with mapping different course variables to each other. 
Being able to visualize the mapping of CLOs and PLOs, allows faculty to really see how the courses in the program 
relate to each other at an overall level and provides students with an additional tool to get information about courses 
in their degree program. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Work 
Throughout the project, the goal was to create a mapping tool to show the relationship between various variables in a 
course. Course learning outcomes were mapped to program learning outcomes with the respective Bloom’s Taxonomy 
Level. Each core course in the Data Science program at Florida Polytechnic University was mapped to a Program 
Learning Outcome. A table was then produced to show how course content (pulled from the syllabus) is mapped to 
course learning outcomes. This table shows that everything being taught in a course needs to have a purpose and if it 
does not have a purpose, then it needs to be updated. 
In the future, this tool can be improved to allow more content to be output. Courses that do not necessarily have a 
Bloom’s Taxonomy word in the CLO, would output a Bloom word based on the information in the course learning 
outcome. This would allow for less manual input from faculty and can improve the way CLO’s are written and mapped. 
When mapping course learning outcomes to course outline, some text mining tools were used to create more authentic 
results when pulling out matching words in the CLO and course outline. Although this did not change the entirety of 
the content of the course outline, certain words or numbers were dropped from the outline which might create some 
confusion with certain course outline descriptions. This could be further developed to incorporate a dictionary that 
would not change some words or remove only specific words, numbers, or patterns. 
Incorporating a tool that would also analyze assessment data for the different CLO’s would be an additional feature 
that can be created in the future. This would allow faculty to have access to everything on one dashboard and can give 
complete insight to a course from start (CLO mapping) to finish (assessment). Assessment data would include items 
like students success rate or which CLO had the most successful assessment. 
An additional tool that could be created based on this work would be to automate a syllabus that would include this 
mapping tool and include necessary information. Faculty would have access to this file and can simply click their 
course, and would be able to see the new syllabus created. This would allow for better insight for a student or faculty 
member and can create a uniform syllabus for all courses in a university. Some preliminary work has been done to 
start implementing this tool. In the two final tabs of the flexdashboard, there is a tab called “Example Syllabus 
(Prototype)” and “Future Implementation”. Ideally, the example syllabus tab is the format of the different tools being 
applied to what the possibility of a syllabus could look like. Each tool used in this project would be outputted based 
on the different course syllabus wanted to be produced. The Future Implementation tab allows for a user to click

2271","through the courses that are in the dataset and would be able to see the output of three of the tools created. The page 
changes as a different course is clicked on. The future implementation will also include any necessary course 
information. For example, if a course has a final project, the automatic syllabus creator would include the rubric for 
the project with any additional information needed.

Abstract 
 
The present work predicts different parameters key to a proper COVID-19 response, through machine learning 
methods. The number of patients affected, hospitalizations, and deaths in the context of the state of Florida is 
considered to provide a blueprint for regional pandemic response. To predict these variables, twenty inputs in four 
categories (type of tests performed, gender, race, and age group) were collected. Official data from the Florida 
State Department of Health were collected and submitted to a linear regression model, fuzzy logic model, and 
long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with the intent of producing predictions as close as possible 
to the actual numbers. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was calculated to measure the deviation of 
the predicted result from the actual values. In addition, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models was 
developed for each output parameter to statistically assess the results of these models. The LSTM deep learning 
model outperformed the fuzzy model, which in turn outperformed linear regression, in terms of the MAPE for the 
‘number of Florida residents affected’. For the ‘number of patients hospitalized’, the LSTM deep learning model 
again outperformed the regression model, while the regression model and the fuzzy model were not significantly 
different. For ‘the number of patient deaths’, however, no model significantly outperformed any other. These 
findings suggest that in regional data, the fuzzy model outperforms linear regression, and the LSTM deep learning 
model outperforms both the fuzzy model and the linear regression model. Implications of this work include a 
better understanding of opportunities and appropriate tools for short-term prediction of future trends when 
variability is high, as well as replacement strategies for datasets with missing values.

1 Introduction 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic 
(Arora et al.2020). Epidemics in one region of the world can quickly spread, especially given the high population 
density and high mobility of the present day (Aristarán et al. 2021). Due to the global pandemic, the world is 
facing a severe and acute public health emergence (Arencibia et al. 2020). The demand for healthcare services 
has rapidly escalated with the spread of COVID-19 (Austin et al. 2020). The economies of all nations of the world 
are facing adverse effects due to COVID-19 (Barbara et al. 2020, Cadogan and Hughe 2021), so the allocation of 
resources to healthcare must be careful and deliberate. Indeed, modeling public health epidemics is important to 
understand the potential impacts and encumbrances of the outbreak (Castillo and Melin 2020). Scantamburlo et 
al. 2021, believe that health authorities and policymakers have been helped by new technology tools to plan and 
modify containment efforts. To be better prepared to manage the impact of this outbreak, mathematical modeling 
is of prime importance. 
 
The government and health service providers need accurate predictions of the spread of the virus to design and 
plan their service responses for different counties and different geographic regions (Fanelli and Piazza et al. 2020) 
Accurate forecasting of the spread of confirmed cases, as well as the analysis of the number of recoveries and 
deaths, is required to predict the global impact of COVID-19. To ensure better healthcare service responses, this 
study aims to develop mathematical forecast models using machine learning approaches to predict the number of 
confirmed cases, the number of hospitalizations, and the number of deaths per day in Florida based on available 
and authentic data. 
 
Health crisis management can be guided by mathematical models. In healthcare policy making, forecasting has 
become the cutting-edge position due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Hamzah et al. 2020). To anticipate the spread 
of the COVID-19 in the UAE, Seasonal autoregressive moving average and autoregressive conditional

Abstract 
 
AdventHealth’s Orlando South Emergency Department’s (ED) Pink Pod, or Lean Pod, routinely provides some of the 
best patient satisfaction and processing time results in AdventHealth EDs in the Central Florida region; however, there 
are numerous opportunities to improve the process further by addressing systemic bottlenecks within existing 
operating procedures. The team sought to find opportunities to accomplish this while also establishing best practices 
and finding weaknesses within the existing system. Here we report the results of our Lean Six Sigma (LSS) effort 
toward improving an area of the ED that, statistically, is operating well but has the potential to perform even better. 
The team conducted explorative observations and interviews with Pink Pod medical staff and leadership to get a better 
understanding of existing procedures as well as employee concerns relating to Pink Pod processes and analyzed 
historical data collected and provided by AdventHealth to identify trends and key statistics. Ultimately, the team was 
able to pinpoint several causative factors affecting patient time-in-system and satisfaction, including issues with 
communication between departments, transportation of patients, the triage process, the implementation of team 
nursing, and gathering and disposing of equipment for use with or on patients. Remedying these issues helped to 
alleviate potential areas for delay and led to increased patient satisfaction and less time spent in the ED for patients in 
the Pink Pod. As a result of the project, AdventHealth has addressed many of the issues the team discovered, including: 
adding more equipment, such as sharps bins; standardizing staffing with core groups of personnel for Pink Pod; and 
revisiting their registration and triage process to help ensure patients are evaluated properly before being assigned to 
their bed in the ED.

1. Introduction  
AdventHealth is responsible for the physical, emotional, and spiritual care of many patients. Each Emergency 
Department (ED) of AdventHealth functions as their own independent system with processes differing from campus 
to campus. The focus of this project will be to investigate the processes of the Orlando South ED campus. Within each 
ED there is a multitude of areas a patient can be placed in depending on their ailment. These areas are defined as 
“Pods.” The choice on what Pod a patient is placed in is dependent upon the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) that the 
patient is assigned. These ESI numbers are defined on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the most urgent and 5 the least 
urgent, based on acuity and resource needs. Pink Pod, which will be the focus of this project, holds patients assigned 
with an ESI level of 5, 4 or 3. The ESI level is assigned by the Triage Nurses upon initial evaluation in the ED. From

2289","5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The team proposed several improvements as a result of our analysis. These included: 
• 
Keeping core groups of workers in the Pink Pod who want to be there 
• 
New doors for patients in the Pink Pod to provide privacy and as a health safeguard 
• 
Increased Sharps bin availability 
• 
More laptops for Pink Pod staff 
• 
More CT machines 
• 
Revise registration process to check for patients with conditions excluding them from care in Pink Pod 
• 
And improvements to the triage process 
With the implementation of these improvements, we believe that patients will experience reduced wait times while 
in Pink Pod. Pink Pod staff will spend less time trying to find specific forms and equipment throughout the ED and 
will be able to provide care to patients in a timelier manner. The team also believes that effectively explaining to 
employees in the Pink Pod expectations and how to achieve them will ultimately aid them in meeting expectations 
as everyone will be aligned to the department’s vision; likewise, should this prove to be insufficient for helping to 
meet expectations, some sort of accountability system could be implemented. Keeping core groups of employees in 
the Pink Pod is beneficial as they work together better as a team that has good chemistry rather than a seemingly 
random group of employees who rotate in and out of the Pink Pod as their schedules, or the department’s schedules, 
allow. Ultimately, tight cohesion and high performance of the group on both the individual and group level is of the 
utmost importance due to the team nursing arrangement present in the ED. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results of our study provided several areas for improvement for the Pink Pod as well as for the ED and 
AdventHealth as a whole. The team recommends an improvement to the onboarding process for new employees which 
will introduce them to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) based on the PMAPs the team developed for the key 
processes a patient will pass through during their time at the ED. Recommendations also include providing a binder 
in the Pink Pod with these SOPs as well as any relevant common health or safety information in case an employee is 
unsure of how a task is completed or how to deal with a certain situation they may face in the Pink Pod. 
 
Difficulties were encountered in attempting to obtain and utilize data for certain time-based metrics; specifically, the 
time taken for the imaging process (excluding transport time). This was identified as a major item that the nurses 
waited on in the treating of patients as per Fig. 7, thus motivating investigation into the time associated with this time 
item. However, it was found over the course of the study that this data was recorded manually, and thus was 
sufficiently low fidelity as to warrant its dismissal during the course of the performed analysis. This then presented 
the team with difficulties in placing numerical values on the savings to be had through the implementation of various 
measures as a share of the magnitude of the patients’ time-in-system. 
 
Communication problems were evident between leadership and the workforce. In several instances, employees were 
asked to explain the process behind certain tasks. There was a high level of variance in response depending on the 
level of experience of the employee as well as how long they’ve worked within Pink Pod. This contrasts with what 
was explained to the team by leadership, which is that everyone is expected to know what they’re doing or what 
they’re supposed to be doing. During our surveys of the employees, we encountered someone who claimed they did 
not know what the proper procedure for a certain task. We believe this could be remedied by a combination of the 
solutions provided in Section 5.3 as well as townhall style meetings between leadership and employees to ensure 
everyone is on the same page and knows what is expected of them. 
 
Overall, the study identified several weak areas within the ED. It can be reported that the ED has already begun the 
process of implementing some of these changes, and to very positive effect. The largest change so far has been the 
implementation of core groups or teams of nurses that work together within Pink Pod regularly. The increase in 
satisfaction among the nurses has been reported by leadership to have been improved, as well as the patient 
throughput—though statistics on these improvements are lacking at the time of writing. Other small improvements 
including additional sharps bins and a revised registration have also been rolled out, though the effects of these changes 
are also yet to be quantified.

Abstract 
 
The Radiation protective mobile cover is a product that blocks or reflects radiation emitting from a communication 
device. These gadgets are continually processing data, thus they are always active. Different components tend to 
generate and emit microwave radiation while processing this data and most of the radiation is emitted through the 
display unit. In this study, the flip cover has been designed in a systematic approach of concurrent engineering to 
obtain a higher overall shielding from radiation generated by the display unit as well as the other components. The 
cover is made of low-cost materials (aluminum foil, rubber) in order to be both economical and healthy for all clients.  
The developed protective cover can protect the customer effectively by filtering 96.07% of the generated radiation. 
This study designed a cover that protects against dangerous energy released by mobile phones. Other sorts of dangers, 
such as fire, chemical, biological, and projectile hazards, can be protected using the principles of the present invention.

1.Introduction 
This research aims to discover how a mobile case can protect humans against Electromagnetic Field (EMF) 
radiation. Smartphones emit radiation mostly when it is transmitting data over cellular networks like texting, calling, 
internet browsing, etc. The majority of mobile phones use frequencies of 850-1800MHz or 900-1900MHz. A mobile 
cover that shields or reflects radiation emitted by a communication device is known as a radiation protection mobile 
cover. Mobile phones are evolving as per customer needs; therefore, mobile phones are getting more attention from 
the customers, manufacturers, and to researchers. Different technologies are employed in a single phone to gain 
additional functionality. Thus, smartphones nowadays contain millions of small semiconductors, network modules, 
etc. that emit microwave radiation while processing data. These microwaves have the ability to penetrate semi-solid 
substances (human skin) and increase temperature. Besides increasing the temperature, these microwaves also cause 
cellular malfunction affecting the self-healing capability of the body cells. Moreover, many users also complain about 
headaches, fatigue, tiredness, blur vision, eye burning, etc. due to the use of mobile phones for prolonged hours. The 
study demonstrates how to overcome these problems by introducing a specialized cover.  
 
2.Literature Review 
Smartphones are becoming part of everyday life for people. We cannot think of a day without smartphones. With the 
technological advancement in making more user-friendly and effective cells, the smartphone industry is changing 
rapidly. However, with that advancement, some degradation is shown in health issues over the last two decades. It has 
been shown that radioactive frequency (RF) radiation has the ability to cause biological damage through heating 
effects (Bonaldi et al., 2014). In a cell, there are seven clusters and each of them has different frequencies. Cells are 
interlinked next to each other to create the cellular network (Webber et al. 1995) . Electric field of 1 V/cm can introduce 
disturbance of the thermal equilibrium inside a cell of 10 μm radius, which is equivalent to disturbance produced by 
a temperature rise of 1 K (Hinrikus et al., 2005). Research shows that there is an effect of radiation on male fertility. 
(Agarwal et al., 2008) An experiment on rats shows that continued use of cell phones permanently damages tissues. 
(Yan et al., 2009) Another study shows continuous use of cell phones over 10 years increases acoustic neuroma 
disease. (Christensen, 2004). On the other hand, some studies show negative or no relation with cancers or such kinds 
of disease. One of them found rare incidents with cancer but they suggest it might show headaches, fatigue

2301",,"Deployment, we get technical preferences.  Then we used the digital logic method to get relative weight and after that, 
we get the weighted score from relative weight and scaled property. From the calculation, we decided to take 
aluminum and rubber. We chose aluminum for radiation protection and rubber for core material. Both are cost-efficient 
and widely available in the market. In the reduction of direct exposure to radiation, our product makes a huge leap in 
the reduction of 96.07 % in E-field and 95.46 % in H-field. Cover design can also withstand impact force in a limited 
range. As our cover only focuses on blocking the radiation emitting from the back of the mobile. However, in front, 
while the mobile is off flip cover will protect but when we work on a mobile screen the cover cannot protect the user 
from radiation. In the future, we should focus on developing a way to defend against radiation emitted directly from 
screens while using mobile phones. We should also focus on developing its design to make it more effective against 
potential damage. Apart from that, we can also work on sustainability, as the world is moving toward a more 
sustainable future.

Abstract 
 
In today's environment, mental wellness is more important than ever. High stress, long hours, work pressure, building 
a reputation for oneself, and a work-life balance between personal and professional life are all symptoms of mental 
illness disorder. Mental health problems are highly prevalent among workers in the tech workplace. This research 
used a dataset called the mental health in tech survey, which gathered data from people all over the world. The goal 
of the proposed research is to determine the frequency of mental health disorders among technical employees versus 
non-technical employees in the workplace. We have explored what are the differences in the prevalence of mental 
disease and attitudes toward mental health by geographic location? What are the most powerful predictors of mental 
illness in the workplace, as well as specific attitudes regarding mental health? It is important detection and diagnosis 
of mental health conditions. This research illuminates the most effective techniques for improving employee well-
being and encouraging them to seek treatment when necessary.

1. Introduction 
Our emotional, psychological, and social well-being are all part of our mental health. It has the potential to influence 
our interactions with others, as well as our professional performance and physical wellness. The problem of mental 
health is receiving an increasing amount of attention these days. For persons with mental illnesses, having a positive 
attitude toward obtaining therapy is critical. There are a variety of elements that can influence one's attitude. Mental 
disease is strongly characterized in society as a shortcoming in a person, and most people are not comfortable admitting 
that they are suffering from mental illness.  According to WHO (2005) high stress, long hours of labor, work pressure, 
and the desire to make a name for oneself characterize people in technical sectors. Perez and Wilkerson (1998) 
mentioned that stress is quickly becoming the most common cause of worker incapacity; according to a poll, stress is 
responsible for 40% of job turnover, and 25% of workers consider work to be their greatest source of stress.

6. Recommendation & Summary of insight 
 
Participants who battle with mental illness but refuse to seek treatment had the most concerns/fears (of 
negative workplace consequences) about disclosing a mental illness, as well as the least availability of benefits and 
support resources. 
 
Supervisors might be trained to spot mental problems and take the initiative to reassure staff to get treatment 
as needed to avoid negative consequences, as they are likely to be the first to notice any issues. 
 
Messages/posters such as ""Having a mental illness is not a shame”, “having a mental illness does not mean 
you are weak"", and ""employees can still strive with managed mental illness"" could be promoted in the workplace to 
increase positive thinking and encourage coping with mental illness, which is especially important when the company 
size exceeds 1000. 
 
Offering benefits to cover mental health treatments encourages people to seek help. 
 
There are fewer negative effects in the job when leave allowance and anonymity protection are provided. 
Many employees are unsure whether their identity is secured when utilizing mental resources, thus employers should 
consider stressing anonymity protection. 
 
7. Conclusion  
With mental health has been a prominent issue of conversation around the world in the last decade, one of the most 
significant spurts in the study has been in this area. From the fundamental causes of mental health difficulties to the 
signs of mental health issues and the most important element of this examination, is how people with mental health 
issues react to them. When comparing those who work in tech to those who do not work in tech, there was a clear 
majority of those who do work in tech. For individuals in the tech industry, the majority of the results were as expected. 
When it comes to the above-mentioned questions and answers, it's clear that there's still a lot of work to be done in 
terms of raising awareness and emphasizing the significance of businesses to begin taking mental health action. A 
startling number of people who said they had mental health concerns didn't even know if the company they worked 
for provided resources, care plans, or assistance for mental health.

Why it is important to discuss the Generic Features of a 
Discrete Event Simulation Software 
Sankar Sengupta 
Professor, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering,

Abstract 
The purpose of this technical paper is to present the generic features of a discrete event simulation software. 
The generic features represent the needs of a model builder during the translation of a problem statement into  a 
simulation model. The generic features are software neutral and recognition of them helps a simulation  model 
builder to migrate from one software to another easily. Some examples of the generic features related to model 
building include: entity generation scheme, resource management procedures, queue management procedures, 
manipulating the simulation clock , representation of system state and ways to terminate a simulation run. In 
addition, the features also include the important tasks of analyzing the input data to identify the best statistical 
distribution for each random element and generation of random variates from commonly used statistical 
distributions. The generic features also include a good source of random number generator as well as capabilities for 
statistical analyses of simulation results. Simulation is an evaluative and not a normative tool. The decision maker is 
often interested to find the best operating parameters of a system that requires use of optimization procedures. The 
DES software should have the added capability to include a search procedure that can operate on a simulation 
model to carry out this task.

Abstract  
 
The aim of this research is to enlighten the methodology model of Industrial Design Structure (IDeS), and validate it 
through the design of different mobility solutions focused on the state of the art technology, as well as offering updated 
product and service characteristics according to the present offerings. IDeS integrates both internal and external 
feedback and exemplifies the application of known methods like QFD, and Design for Six Sigma to systematically 
bring the information across the entire organization, resulting in important time and resources gain in the overall 
product development process. The IDeS methodology is sequentially composed of Quality Function Deployment 
(QFD), Benchmarking (BM), Top‐Flop analysis (TFA), Stylistic Design Engineering (SDE). Then planning the whole 
product development, including the prototyping and testing phases, budgeting, aiming to reach production-related 
decisions. The present work illustrates how the IDeS method manages to integrate the abovementioned design methods 
to achieve a convincing result. As a result, different sustainable mobility solution proposals are exposed, both for 
personal and mass transportation, that combine speed, comfort and eco-sustainability with the purpose of replacing 
the current means of transport and moving towards future technologies for vehicles, and after the assessment to the 
observed problematic on urban and extra-urban transport systems, as well for new vehicle development requirements.

1. Introduction  
This work proposes to analyze the IDeS method in its overall complexity, going to show, by breaking it down into its 
various parts, how its application will help designers in the realization of complex projects. During the development 
of a project there are many complexities and problems that occur, the application of this methodology allows with 
proven ease to keep an eye on all these aspects in one place, with obvious increase in overall efficiency in terms of 
time invested and final quality of work. One of the main problems is to be able to follow in an organic and in-depth 
way the whole chain of the project, being able to have the possibility to go down in the development of individual 
details while being able to have an overview, which is essential to have the highest level of innovation as a track for 
the project. Thanks to the IDeS method this problem is significantly reduced, thanks to the structure of the succession 
of the various steps that make the whole design very scientific and repeatable. 
  
The Industrial Design Structure (IDeS) method is organized according to a well-defined analytical scale and is useful 
for designing a valid product within the reference market. Several case studies were taken for practical application of 
this method, and the foundations were laid for the design of a concept for the development of a new hybrid vehicle, 
with technologies available nowadays, combining the functions of an electric minibus with those of a magnetic

6. Conclusion  
State of the art review noticed the increase of demand of sustainable mobility solutions in order to solve current 
environmental and mobility challenges in our societies. Industrial Design Structure Method was successfully applied 
to the conception, and feasibility analysis of four mobility solutions for the near future. This case studies of a probable 
product conception were developed by the information gathered from knowledge of the design department, which 
allowed to oversee main product use and shapes. This information also was useful to gather the understanding that 
mobility solutions often require a physical plus a service product offering, and every detail can be solved on time from 
the first product requisites gathered at this point. The obtained models were subjected to physical and virtual validation 
through CAM technologies such as AM and visualization tools through rendering such as VRed and Keyshot. Through 
these tools, it turned out to be possible to have photorealistic three-dimensional images from the previously made 3D 
models, so as to provide a clear idea of the product, and to be able to make photo-insertions, so as to place it in a 
credible usage environment. Using Unity, it was possible to create an augmented reality environment in which to 
verify the use and proportions of the product.

Abstract 
 
A digital twin or digital replica is a virtual model of a physical asset such as a product, process, system, or facility. It 
utilizes data from an actual physical asset to understand better and augment its performance, powered by artificial 
intelligence (A.I.), machine learning, and data analytics. Digital twins can mirror a physical twin and reveal issues 
before they occur. They rely on sensors embedded in the physical world to transfer real-time data about the operative 
process and environment. The data collected from the connected sensors is then analyzed on the cloud and is accessible 
via a dashboard. Digital twins are powerful masterminds to drive innovation and performance. Unsynchronized 
production can easily cause problems such as the backlog of intermediate warehouses, unsmooth production, and long 
production cycles. Synchronized production helps to improve overall efficiency and reduce waste. The material 
handling, production logistics path, movement pattern, suspension, and caching mode of the WIP (Work-In-Process) 
need to be planned based on the equipment's action and behavior mode. Unloading, distributing, and delivering raw 
materials to the manufacturing unit and warehouse are all part of material handling. The digital twin technology 
provides a highly efficient runtime environment for simulating complex systems and searching for robust 
computational optimization models. Digital twin technology has a wide range of economic value depending on the 
monetization model. This study explored costly industrial or business equipment, services, or processes that can be 
optimized by reducing asset downtime and lowering overall maintenance costs. These capabilities are essential, 
making internal software competencies crucial to driving value.

1. Introduction 
At the dawn of the 21st century, the world is witnessing the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation 
of the business world, which is commonly referred to as Industry 4.0. (Ardito et al. 2018), (Bauer 2018), (Shadravan 
et al. 2021) and (Rad et al. 2015). Since the term ""Industrie 4.0"" was first publicized in 2011, the digital transformation 
created by Industry 4.0 has immediately grabbed the attention of industrialists and governments worldwide 
(Nascimento et al. 2018) and (Mirabi et al. 2018). During the first industrial revolution in the 18th century, the world 
was challenged to meet the ever-growing demand for goods from limited and diminishing resources, while limiting 
their impact on the environment and society (Beier et al. 2018), (Zakertabrizi et al. 2021), (Hosseini et al. 2021), and 
(Müller et al. 2018). It is increasingly recognized that Industry 4.0 can contribute to sustainable economic, 
environmental, and social development (Talaeikhozani et al. 2020), (Taheri et al. 2018) and (Gabris et al. 2022). The 
industry 4.0 environment places computers, smart materials, and intelligent machines in constant communication, 
interacting with the environment, and making decisions without the need for human intervention (Shokrolahzade et 
al. 2017) (Gilchrist 2016) and (Shokuhi et al. 2017). The digitalization of manufacturing and business processes and 
the deployment of smarter machines and devices may offer numerous advantages such as increased productivity, 
increased resource efficiency, and reduced waste (Shadravan et al. 2019) and (Tortorella et al. 2018). The present 
study seeks to address this issue by examining how the Digital Industrial Revolution - a set of underlying digital 
technologies and design principles - can help achieve economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Therefore, 
this study presents a concise analysis of the concept of the industry 4.0 phenomenon and its functionality. 
 
This technological framework presents a background for smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS), which is designed 
to optimize production processes in an interoperable context by combining digital twin (DT) technology for automated

Abstract 
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic impacted millions of people worldwide, it is vital to know the factors that may affect 
the risk to an individual. The epidemic of COVID-19 posed a significant threat to public health. This study aimed to 
assess the risk perception of COVID19 among students in the Philippines during the quarantine period and to 
investigate the risk factors associated with it. This study used an online survey to encourage college students from 
various parts of the Philippines' National Capital Region to participate. The study comprised a total of 100 college 
students. The risk factors affecting the students' perception of COVID-19 risk were determined using the RIKA risk 
assessment tool. Health, behavior, exposure, and social policy were all considered risk factors. The link between the 
risk factors and the perceived risk of COVID-19 was investigated using correlation analysis. The study revealed that 
exposure risk factors had a minor association with the perceived risk of COVID-19 among students. In addition, it 
was also found that health risk factors had an association with behavioral, exposure, and social policy risk factors. In 
contrast, behavioral risk factors are associated with exposure and social policy. Hence, because of COVID-19's high 
infectivity and opacity, it's critical to raise risk perception among college students through various forms of health 
education, with particular emphasis dedicated to some high-risk individuals.

1. Introduction  
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
outbreak appears to have started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Chen et al., 2020). As a result, it has spread 
rapidly both within and outside China (Giovanetti et al., 2020). It has evolved into a unique, worldwide public health 
issue as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted millions of people worldwide. It is essential to know the factors that may 
affect an individual.  
 
As the number of people dying from the virus climbs worldwide, it's more important than ever to grasp the 
infection's perceived risk. People's subjective evaluation and judgment of hazards to which they may be exposed, in 
terms of severity, features, and management, is known as risk perception. Individual, societal, cultural, and 
contextual factors all influence it, and it is founded on experiences, beliefs, attitudes, judgments, misunderstandings, 
and sentiments (Cori et al., 2020). Fear and anxiety are heightened because of risk perception, prompting preventive 
behavior. People with high-risk perceptions are more likely to undertake protective health behaviors, which 
minimizes the risk of infection (Dryhurst et al., 2020; de Bruin & Bennett, 2020). 
 
At the individual, local, and worldwide levels, risk perception is critical in determining the extent of community 
understanding of the pandemic's severity and readiness to participate in the implementation of health-prevention 
measures. There is a research gap regarding the degree of risk perception in reaction to health pandemics in different 
societies, particularly among students. Colleges and universities are among the most dynamic groups, with high 
mobility and sociability. They are youthful, healthy, and show just minor symptoms after becoming infected with a 
highly contagious virus and quickly passed from one person to another (Tadese et al., 2021). Furthermore, 
determining the level of awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic among students, their intentions and abilities to

6. Conclusion 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, strategies to encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors should emphasize 
raising risk perception and demonstrating the effectiveness of the behavioral actions taken to reduce risk. Health 
education programs customized to specific sociodemographic groups are critical for boosting the adoption of 
outbreak prevention measures by raising public awareness, perceptions, and attitudes.

Abstract 
 
As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, the transition to online education has affected college students' academic 
stress and their compelling environment. Students may experience significant stress due to such a rapid and abrupt 
change in the educational system. Family-related pressure, financial problems, an excessive amount of workload, fear 
of contagion, isolation, and their relationship to academic life contribute to academic stress. This study aims to 
determine whether there is a relationship between the perceived risk of COVID-19 and college students' academic 
stress. A total of 303 college students participated in the online survey questionnaire to measure their perceived risks 
of COVID-19 and their academic stress. The results were tallied and analyzed using statistical procedures. The results 
were treated using correlation analysis to determine the relationship between the perceived risk of COVID-19 and 
academic stress factors. Results revealed that the perceived risk of COVID-19 had a significant effect on 
undergraduate students' academic stress, specifically on factors such as isolation, contagion, and relationship to 
academic life. These findings suggest that some students may be particularly vulnerable to academic stress and poor 
emotional well-being due to the pandemic, emphasizing the need for immediate intervention and prevention strategies.

wreaked havoc on the health care system and the education system. Students' learning losses are projected to be 
considered a result of school closures and issues in the delivery of remote learning. While the number of students 
taking online courses has expanded in recent years, most students are still unfamiliar with the concept of distant 
learning. This lack of expertise could be exacerbated by difficult home conditions, such as a lack of academic resources 
(e.g., computers and internet access) and distractions in the home learning environment. Preliminary research indicates 
that at-home distractions (such as interruptions from other family members and additional responsibilities) pose a 
significant challenge for COVID-19 college students learning from home (Son et al., 2020). These issues, when 
considered collectively, are likely to cause severe academic stress and uncertainty. 
 
Students are also dealing with the emotional impact of COVID-19 and the stressors associated with a potentially 
unfamiliar online learning environment. Fear of contracting the virus, a lack of treatment, a higher mortality rate 
associated with the virus, and uncertainty about when the virus will be controlled and when a vaccine will be available 
are the major factors found to be highly responsible for increasing psychological distress, adjustment, and even more 
serious mental health problems. Economic loss, disruption of daily routine, inability to participate in social events and 
constant news exposure are all factors that negatively impact mental health. In the U.S., a study showed that college 
students exhibit mental health and well-being problems comparable to those in other parts of the world dealing with 
COVID-19 (Luo et al., 2020; Son et al., 2020). 
 
During times of pandemic, emotional well-being is influenced by both individual and societal factors. Until now, 
COVID-19 research on emotional well-being has primarily focused on societal-level factors such as response to

6. Conclusion 
The outcomes of this study revealed that the COVID-19 outbreak had had a substantial impact on student's mental 
health, education, and daily routine. The COVID-19-related disruptions bring critical issues and provide an 
opportunity to assess alternative educational strategies. Results of the present study revealed that the perceived risk of 
COVID-19 had a significant effect on undergraduate students' academic stress, specifically on factors such as 
isolation, contagion, and relationship to academic life. These findings suggest that some students may be particularly 
vulnerable to academic stress and poor emotional well-being due to the pandemic, emphasizing the need for immediate 
intervention and prevention strategies.

Abstract 
 
Since the coronavirus outbreak, the Philippines has been one of the many countries in the world to close its colleges 
and institutions, putting students at risk of being isolated from their schools and communities. This study was able to 
help address the issues that contribute significantly to students' sleep quality by assessing the impact of the pandemic 
on their fatigue levels. Based on the results of 216 students, the majority of respondents are mentally drained, have 
insufficient stamina for daily activities, and become sleepy very quickly. Thus, it is critical to support and monitor the 
well-being of college students when they reach critical developmental milestones in an unstable social environment.

1. Introduction 
On March 8, 2020, the Philippine government announced a declaration of the public health crisis throughout the nation. 
In late January 2020, the first foreign patient of COVID-19 was discovered. The people's right to health is safeguarded 
and promoted. A total lockdown or Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) was imposed on the whole Luzon cluster 
of islands. ECQ is the harshest category of lockdown, putting institutions, workplaces, shared spaces, and public transit 
on pause. Most of the remaining portion of the Philippines was quarantined shortly afterward in the same year, 
wreaking havoc on the healthcare, socioeconomic, cultural, and educational systems. These constraints drastically 
altered people's way of living and social interactions, causing uneasiness in many. There was a considerable rise in 
psychological discomfort and mental illness manifestations in the broader public (Aliana et al. 2021). 
 
Students have been unable to attend classes in the Philippines due to the strict quarantine protocols. Because several 
Filipinos lack access to technology and dependable internet, distance learning has presented many issues for numerous 
students, families, and professors. Since the coronavirus epidemic emerged, the Philippines has been one of the few 
nations to keep colleges and universities shut, putting pupils at greater risk of opting out of educational and community 
isolation (Armand et al. 2021). Adverse occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic can create emotional trauma and 
depressive disorders, which have been noted by 7% of female Wuhan students in the latest studies and can severely 
affect sleep quality. 
 
According to considerable research, stress, anxiety, depressive illness, and sleeplessness have grown throughout the 
COVID-19 outbreak, particularly among college students who have changed their lifestyles. As a result, sleep 
difficulties or disorders wreak havoc on university students' academic performance, frequently linked to mental health 
conditions (Henna et al. 2028). Many young people don't acquire as much sleep to function effectively in class and on 
schoolwork, and excessive use of technology tends to disrupt their sleeping patterns. Because blue light from 
smartphones and electronics suppresses melatonin release, the most affected one is the sleep quality (Benham et 
al,2020). 
The study mainly tackles the effect that the Covid pandemic has contributed on the respondent's quality of sleep. Other 
factors that could affect an individual's sleep quality besides the pandemic are not discussed. It is also essential to

5. Conclusion 
Since implementing the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in the Philippines in 2020 due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, schools and universities have shifted to online education to prevent the virus spread among students and 
teachers. Since the pandemic, universities, and schools are closed, contributing to the probability of students feeling 
that they are opting out of school or community isolation. Furthermore, through the shift in online learning, the 
difference between home-study life can be challenging to separate. Stressors such as excessive workload, anxiety, 
depressive disorders, and sleep deprivation presumably affect the students' physical, emotional, and mental health. 
Being in a situation of uncertainty, it is essential to prioritize health, especially among students. One of the most critical 
factors that affect one's health is sleep, as it is considered a basic necessity in one's life. Most students feel that studying 
excessively and finishing the workload of activities compared to having a good quality sleep can increase their 
academics. Yet, this type of habit can be dangerous to one's health. For further analysis, this study aims to evaluate 
the sleeping quality of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic by determining the effects of sleep quality on 
their fatigue level. This can be beneficial to students and universities to assess the factors that contribute to a student's 
fatigue level. Results in this study were gathered from college students using a survey questionnaire aiming to 
determine. Through the collected data, the assessment of students' fatigue is feeling exhausted throughout the day. 
This can be correlated to students' sleep quality since sleep deprivation makes students feel drowsy and tired during 
the day (Henna, 2018). To understand the factors that disturbs students' sleep quality, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI) was utilized. Hence, by assessing these factors, it was determined that difficulty in sleeping attained the highest 
rate, followed by lack of enthusiasm. Night routines such as using gadgets before sleeping and academic performance 
can be causes that can affect these situations. 
 
In closing, mental fatigue and physical fatigue have affected one another. Students experiencing either one of these 
fatigue levels causes them to experience the other. Their relationship with one another suggests that excessive 
workload from school or home and stressors regarding their mental health can be indicators of fatigue that students 
can experience within their bodies. 
 
6. Recommendation 
This study provided an accurate and deep understanding of how mental and physical fatigue correlates to the sleep 
quality of college students. Results show that 92.6% of the respondents experience substantial fatigue, and all factors 
from the fatigue assessment scale are significant. Moreover, there is only a moderate correlation between sleep quality 
and physical fatigue, which proves that the students' only four (4) from the PSQI were significant and highly felt. 
Given these numbers, it is still advisable for students to achieve a good sleep quality as it is the primary source of 
vitality, motivation, and physical and mental well-being. 
 
In an unstable social situation, it is crucial to show support and monitor the well-being of college students as they 
achieve major developmental milestones, as sleep deprivation highly influences university students' academic success. 
Institutions are advised to provide ample time for students to recover from academic workloads, provide counseling

their working environment. 
 
This study was limited to the information on the students' academic workload and their daily activities. However, it 
was evident that the sleep quality of the respondents is slightly greater on poor sleep. This could be attributed to bad 
sleeping habits, including irregular sleep cycles, medical conditions, psychological issues, taking vices, or too much 
screen time. For future researchers, it is recommended to look at the students' sleep quality before, during, and after 
the COVID-19 lockdown. It is also advisable to consider other age groups as respondents (Elementary, Junior and 
Senior High School, Master's Degree, and Post-Graduate) and look upon their pre-existing psychological issues and 
daily activities.

Abstract 
 
As a preventative measure against the spread of the coronavirus disease, most educational systems worldwide have 
shifted to remote learning (COVID-19). However, the quick shift to online learning has produced some difficulties 
that have yet to be overcome. This paper aims to describe the effects of academic workload on student burnout during 
online classes. Students in the Philippines face difficulties with remote learning after the COVID-19 crisis. The 
researchers used data from a sample of 204 respondents obtained from a digital survey containing their responses. The 
research aims to analyze and give an interpretation of the survey results with the use of Pearson correlation analysis. 
The content analysis revealed the following categories of effects of academic workload on student burnout during 
online classes: work is hurried and rushed, workloads are challenging to manage during online classes, feeling 
discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed, feeling burnout, and feeling fatigued. Furthermore, regression analysis 
proved that students' academic burnout is significantly influenced by physical workload, reduced sense of 
performance, effort, and frustration. Thus, education and counseling support are needed to reduce the student’s burnout 
during online learning.

1. Introduction 
Due to the current situation in the Philippines, schools and universities have decided to postpone face-to-face classes 
indefinitely and instead conduct online classes. As a result, students study at their respective homes while finding it 
difficult to study online (Santos, 2020). Studies have been conducted by (Yang, Chen & Chen, 2021) that academic 
workload on student burnout is one of the factors limiting students' ability to perform well in online classes. It also 
takes a toll on students' physical and mental health as new problems arise. Students' physical and mental health are 
currently suffering due to the movement from normal life to a new environment or system that they are in.  
 
A study by (Alam et al., 2021) showed that many students complain about the academic workload during online 
classes, which leads to burnout and harms their health. In particular, their mental and physical health because they are 
required to sit for long periods in front of computer screens, which can cause back and eye problems, eating problems, 
and even sleep problems. The researchers want to know how strong the relationship between academic workload 
burnout and students' physical and mental health is and whether online classes are hazardous to students.  
 
This study was designed to address the presence of academic workload on the burnout of undergraduate students 
during online classes and its relationship to their physical and mental health during online classes and help instructors 
and the university appraise the workload given to students. Students will benefit from this research by analyzing and 
assessing the academic workload assigned to them to avoid burnout and prepare for potential risks to their physical 
and mental health. The findings of this study will also assist professors in assessing and limiting the academic 
workload assigned to students and ensuring that activities distributed during online classes are appropriate for the

2386","5. Conclusion 
The findings of this study can be used to look at how health, stress, and workload are associated and draw conclusions 
about what this means for undergraduate students doing online learning. This study's findings have significant 
consequences for mental health professionals. The study showed that burnout, a widespread problem among students, 
impacts numerous aspects of their lives, including their functionality, contentment, and outlook on the future, causing 
them to experience psychological issues such as despair. When a student seeks psychiatric help with complaints like 
disappointment due to high expectations, inactivity due to a lack of energy, frustration due to giving up personal 
expectations, lack of interest, and sensitivity, mental health professionals may be able to provide them with more 
efficient help if academic burnout is suspected.

Abstract 
 
This research study focuses on determining the boredom and work engagement of the students in the online class 
setting. Boredom is a prevalent emotion of becoming uninterested in any activity. It is a common emotion for everyone 
and significantly affects the work engagement of the students in an online class. The researchers gathered data from 
200 students from different universities. Student boredom was measured using the Utrecht Boredom Scale, which 
contains eight items capturing boredom's affective, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations. On the other hand, work 
engagement is measured using a 3-item version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, which contains items 
measuring vigor, dedication, and absorption. The association between boredom and variables of work engagement is 
analyzed using the Pearson correlation test. Results revealed that students who felt bored during online learning 
displayed a low level of vigor and absorption. In contrast, students who showed a high level of vigor said a higher 
level of absorption and dedication during online learning. The result opens an opportunity to make the learning system 
in online classes better because it is more susceptible to boredom that lessens the work engagement of the students.

1. Introduction 
Boredom is a prevalent emotion of becoming uninterested in any activity. It is a common emotion that slowly leans 
towards negative consequences. It can be achieved due to being empty and having nowhere to direct the energy in our 
system. According to (Hooft 2018), boredom correlates with the level of arousal activation of the people. As the 
gradual increase of boredom occurs, the mental health of a human being slowly falls on being frustrated and depressed. 
Based on (Weir 2013), boredom relates to the power of attention. Even though a person has different goals and 
priorities, being stimulated and aroused is not present. Thus, the attention is being scattered away and unable to do 
anything because of the mental engagement. Boredom is always present in students' engagement with different 
subjects. Based on a study by Sweeney (2019), a student's attention fades away due to various circumstances, such as 
the subject being uninteresting, the class being too easy/difficult for the student, and the professor is not conducive to 
learning.  
 
This issue has already existed since school started. The universal experience of boredom affects different ages but is 
commonly directed to students because of lesser priorities than adults. The boredom worsened when the pandemic 
and online classes were introduced (Hansanali, 2021). According to Affelat's (2021) study, various factors affect 
students' boredom in an online class setting. Disengagement, monotony, repetitiveness, and lack of satisfaction and 
challenge contribute to students' boredom in classes (Pawlak et al., 2020). It was also found that low achievers report 
a higher boredom level than high achievers. The boredom and psychological distress of the students were also found 
to be significantly associated.  
 
One of the components that are negatively impacted by boredom is engagement, which decreases performance. 
Boredom must be overcome to avoid disengagement (Macklem, 2015). Engagement is a multifaceted phenomenon 
that is an essential aspect of the learning process. Behavioral engagement, such as effort; emotional engagement, such

2394","In a study conducted by Barnes & Noble College Insights (2022) on 400 college students whose schools had recently 
moved to online education, it was found that 60% of students thought they were at least somewhat prepared for the 
transition and find online learning more challenging that traditional learning. This was especially true for students 
who had previously taken an online class. 64% of survey participants voiced concerns about their ability to focus and 
sustain the self-discipline required to study online. Most of the students  recounted the challenges of distance learning, 
from struggling to understand assignments and getting easily distracted to not having reliable internet. This current 
state of online learning is likely to worsen existing disparities and create barriers to remote learning. According to a 
nationwide cross-sectional study, thirty-two percent (32%) and twenty-two percent (22%) of 3,670 Filipino medical 
students polled, respectively, have difficulty transitioning to new learning styles and do not have dependable internet 
access (Baticulon et al., 2020). For some, purchasing a learning gadget that allows them to effortlessly tune in to online 
classes and turn in assignments in the online system may be tough (Santos, 2020). Despite efforts to make education 
more accessible to all, Filipino university students still face numerous challenges when it comes to distant learning. 
 
4.4. Result of Correlation Analysis 
Table 3 showed the Pearson r correlation results. Student boredom was tested to each factor of work engagement 
(vigor, dedication, and absorption). The result indicated that vigor and absorption had negative association to boredom 
suggesting that the more bored students reported themselves to be, the lower their levels of vigor, absorption and 
behavioral engagement. Moreover, it was found that absorption had highest association with vigor and has moderation 
association with dedication. This suggest that students who exhibited high level of vigor had exhibited also high level 
of absorption and dedication during online learning. These findings are consistent with previous research into the 
relationship between boredom and its causes and effects (Pekrun et al., 2010, Tze et al, 2013; Tze et al, 2014).

According to studies, boredom and work engagement are linked, suggesting that boredom reduces students 
productivity and well-being (Whiteoak, 2014). Work engagement is defined as ""a pleasant, rewarding work-related 
state of mind marked by energy, dedication, and immersion"" (Schaufeli et al., 2002,). Students who are bored, on the 
other hand, are in a dissatisfying negative mood that is often related with unfavorable outcomes and withdrawal from 
task (Bruursema, Kessler & Spector, 2011; Game, 2007). It suggests that boredom reduces student engagement and 
vice versa (Reijseger et al. 2012). Workplace boredom (an unpleasant state of passiveness) is the polar opposite of job 
engagement (a positive state of activity). According to Warr and Inceoglu (2012), work engagement is adversely 
associated to workplace boredom. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the findings, the students indeed feel bored during online classes. When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, 
most students had difficulty transitioning to virtual learning. According to the result of this study, most of the students 
found their studies challenging during online learning, and while doing some school requirements, they observed that 
time seemed to pass very quickly. It was also found in the study that students who feel bored during class had displayed 
low level of vigor and absorption during online class. Thus, to avoid boredom during online learning, the researchers 
recommend the following. It is recommended that the institution initiate interaction by providing creative and helpful 
programs during online classes, such as making games as promising learning tools every once in a while, throughout

2398","the class. Games have unique characteristics that allow teachers to engage difficult-to-reach students in ways that 
lessons cannot (Matthew Lynch, 2016). Furthermore, it is recommended that the institution find new ways to check 
in with the students, such as assistance to struggling students, then conducting surveys regarding their mental health 
and providing contact details to the people they can reach out to. It is also recommended for students to involve in 
some indoor activities with people in their houses, such as indoor exercises, family game nights, and virtual movie 
parties with friends. When things become more unmotivating during online classes, these activities may help them 
boost their social interactions. 
 
Students should be taught to accept boredom as a temporary absence of excitement and to recognize and understand 
their own needs and feelings in order to devote more diligence, sobriety, and engagement to their assignments. 
Boredom can be lessened by giving students choices so that they feel more in control of the learning process. Mastery 
goals that demonstrate the true meaning of perseverance can also be strengthened to reduce boredom. It makes students 
less likely to give up in difficult situations and makes them more determined to discover task-based self-improvement 
activities.

Abstract 
 
This research study focuses on determining the factors that influence the satisfaction level of students in their learning 
environment during an online class. A learning environment refers to learning resources and technology, teaching 
methods, modes of learning, and connections to societal and global contexts. In this study, the factors used to measure 
the learning environment consisted of adequate learning materials, adequate access to gadgets for online learning, 
reliable and fast internet connection, physical and mental capacity, enough time and resources, enough skills for an 
online class, and enough infrastructure to support online learning. On the other hand, student satisfaction was measured 
based on teaching and delivery quality, facilitating conditions, and LMS quality. Pearson correlation test was 
employed to determine the association of learning environmental factors to students' satisfaction. In addition, 
regression analysis was also utilized to determine which factors influenced students' overall satisfaction during online 
learning. Results revealed that enough resources and skills and enough infrastructure to support online learning, have 
very high association with teaching delivery quality and LMS quality. In addition, regression analysis showed that 
factors that significantly influenced students' satisfaction are adequate learning materials, adequate access to gadgets, 
enough resources and skills, and enough infrastructure to support online learning.

1. Introduction 
The public health concerns led to a rushed closure of most higher education institutions worldwide in late March 2020 
to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of these closures, universities have had to utilize online 
teaching platforms regardless of the expertise of students and teachers in terms of technical skills and readiness. While 
online learning is not a new pedagogical method and has been used in various fields for many years, there is still a 
lack of competence in implementing online learning platforms. The emphasis on information technology in education 
is broadening beyond enhancing learning environments to include factors other than hardware, software, and the 
network. The learning environment is a synthesis of human practices and material systems, much like an ecology is a 
synthesis of living things and their surroundings.  
 
Online learning refers to an electronic learning (e-learning) environment where, unlike traditional learning, there are 
no physical peer learners, and time and space are free. However, e-learning makes learning flexible and offers an 
alternative for those who, for some reason, cannot attend traditional classrooms. With the growth of technology and 
the internet, e-learning has secured a good position in the academic world. E-learning is temporarily classified under 
the distance learning category. Indeed, there are numerous benefits of online learning, especially today. Still, 
conversely, some concerns lead to online learner brain drain and ultimately hamper the progress of online courses. 
Lack of interest or lack of motivation is one of the main reasons that inhibit the growth of online learning and, in this 
way, also increases the rate of online course dropouts. Research has identified numerous critical challenges that are 
believed to affect education in an online environment. These challenges include the instructors' assessment of learners' 
academic integrity, cyberstalking and cyberbullying, lack of internet access, low quality of online instruction delivery, 
cost control, individual learning process, lack of professional technological training, inaccessibility of tools, and

4.4. Result of Regression Analysis 
Table 4 shows the result of regression analysis; it was found that the factors that significantly influenced students' 
overall satisfaction during online learning are adequate learning materials, adequate access to gadgets, enough 
resources and skills, and infrastructure and resources. This finding is supported by prior studies that attempt to prove 
factors affecting students' satisfaction in e-learning. In a study by Allen et al. (2020), it was found that digital literacy 
levels, learner engagements, instructor support and guidance, and course design have all been linked to higher levels 
of learner satisfaction. According to Al Ghandi (2017) and Alyasi (2016), most universities invest heavily in a large 
team of specialists to enable remote learning and provide an effective preparation program for students and faculty. 
To deliver distance education, various technological tools that enhance learning interactions via learning management 
systems, such as video conferencing, discussion forums, threads, or prerecorded videos, have been used.

On the other hand, physical and mental capacity showed no significant influence on students' overall satisfaction, as 
supported by the study by Ahmad (2011). Prior research proved that traditional classroom settings are more effective 
than online learning since students can participate actively in face-to-face classes and interact more with teachers and 
classmates than with e-learning. Lastly, another factor found to have no significant influence on overall satisfaction is 
having enough time and resources. Since most participants of the study were from Mapúa University, wherein there 
are classes/courses that are self-phased or asynchronous, most activities/requirements are done in the students’ 
convenient time, and students are not required to have immediate access to the internet, thus, having enough time and 
resources do not affect their overall satisfaction.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The study's findings revealed that three learning environment factors, such as LMS quality, facilitating conditions, 
and teaching delivery quality, played significant roles in student satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic's 
emergency shift to remote learning. In addition, it was also proved that having adequate learning materials, adequate 
access to gadgets, enough resources and skills, and having infrastructure and resources during online learning

students' overall satisfaction with online learning. The researchers also recommend that schools and universities use 
this data to help improve the overall quality of relaying educational instructions to their students. The researchers also 
suggest that this topic be generated from a more specific perspective in future research.

Abstract 
 
This research paper focuses on the details of designing and executing an assessment center towards an endeavor for 
leadership readiness in organizations. The paper is designed to help today’s managers and professionals about the 
fundamental information required to create the assessment centers that can act as a springboard to develop the 
employee’s leadership abilities. Being a talent development practitioner, the author could trace and provide insights 
on how assessment centers can provide an ideal platform for the high potential performers in organizations to be 
successful in an increasingly complex world. Based on literature review and the contemporary work done the most 
critical need today in business leadership is a new kind of leader: authentic leader- and the assessment center approach 
can serve as a pedestal and tool in evaluating the leadership traits and competencies. The efforts involved in designing 
and executing an assessment center is outlined that can be used in nurturing the high potential performers for 
leadership readiness. The assessment center is depicted to be a reliable platform and tool for gauging and evaluating 
the existing leadership pipeline in an organization revolving around the scope of this work. Assessment center methods 
can help organizations achieve the mission critical goals- helping its leaders to be successful in hostile, turbulent, 
ambiguous and uncertain business environment on increasing the organizational competencies to sustain the strategy.

1.Introduction 
Over the past six to seven decades, various scholars have conducted research, studies and analysis with an intention 
to explore the varied and different styles, characteristics or the personality attributes of successful business leaders. 
However, it is surprising to observe that nothing definite has emerged that would authenticate a clear profile of the 
ideal leader. This is not surprising as there cannot be a specific formula or panacea that the individuals would be 
forever trying to imitate.  Moreover, by doing so their originality would be lost and the authenticity would be in 
question. As a matter of fact the team members would like their leaders when they are genuine and not a replica of 
another individual. Authentic leaders demonstrate a passion to whatever they are involved in, they adhere strictly to 
the values and use both the head and heart to lead. They are in a mode to establish long term relationships and 
demonstrate self-discipline to get the results. 
Over the years several industry captains have indicated their strong desires to become authentic leaders and have tried 
to explore the ways and build platforms that can help them to realise their potential. Can there be a platform that would 
help identify the budding leaders core competencies   that would highlight and enhance the individual’s capability and 
productivity as a leader, evoking passion in others and personal effectiveness? Increasingly, the industry captains are

5.Proposed Findings and Managerial Implications 
The lessons that we have learned over the course of the last several decades have made it very evident that volatility 
is ubiquitous. Nobody has been able to accurately forecast how deep COVID-19 will go. The executives of a company 
need to get their heads around the fact that the Leadership Development process can only be altered if it can be adapted 
to the existing culture of the company. Rather of focusing on the accomplishments of the past, the most essential thing 
is to identify the skills. However, it has been noticed that any discussions about the process of defining the essential 
skills have the potential to quickly become contentious. The topic of whether or not competences can even be defined 
at all raises the eyebrows of many people. However, it is important to note that the vast majority of business leaders 
are of the opinion that once the competencies have been defined, one can without a doubt anticipate consistent results 
regardless of location, role, or the business entity in question. This fact bears mentioning because it is relevant. At this 
point, the assessment centres have an opportunity to make a significant contribution. 
 
It is becoming more usual for businesses to bring in executives from outside the company in order to broaden their 
range of capabilities and expertise when they undergo structural changes in order to adapt to new forms of technology, 
new types of clients, and new types of markets. The leaders need to rely on the development function throughout this 
process of picking the leaders from external sources, bearing in mind the cultural challenges, and so introducing the 
newly recruited leader to the company's ethos, norms, culture, and values. Because diversity is the order of the day, 
organisations have a responsibility to work toward including members of a broad community into the process of 
leadership development. To a greater extent, since the unique experiences and viewpoints brought by the members of 
the group contribute to the overall acceleration of the learning process. As a result, it is not uncommon to find that 
many organisations in today's world are working toward incorporating a diverse range of nationalities, cultural 
perspectives, and business savvy into their leadership development programmes. Evaluation carried out at assessment 
centres thus serves as a pivot point to entwine this preparedness for leadership. . The design of an effective assessment 
centre has the potential to reflect and unfold changes in the underlying processes, practises, and systems that have an 
effect on the fundamental aspects of an organization's performance. Assessment centres are beneficial to leaders 
because they encourage them to think about developing new methods of working together, which in turn sparks new 
ideas. This is true despite the fact that such leaders may have a variety of titles and responsibilities. Let's all agree that 
organisations will keep on focusing on identifying and developing a small set of essential competencies. The design 
and establishment of assessment centres are increasingly taking place within this framework. An organised effort that 
is made in the assessment centres may shed light on the way that one thinks about leadership. This is because the 
leadership practise entails increasing the capacity of role holders who are involved in actual change processes to 
prepare themselves today to react tomorrow.  
 
The use of assessment centre methods can assist organisations in accomplishing their mission-critical objectives, such 
as assisting their leaders in achieving success in an unfriendly, turbulent, ambiguous, and uncertain business 
environment, and in increasing the organisational competencies necessary to maintain the strategy. This study paper 
is a novel piece of work that may be of tremendous importance not just for academics but also for HR professionals 
and talent development experts more generally in terms of recognising, cultivating, and developing future leaders. 
 
6.Conclusion 
The higher echelons of many organisations maintain the practise of promoting individuals into management and 
leadership roles based on a single particular ability such as technical proficiency. On the other hand, there are plenty 
of situations in which that level of expertise does not always translate into strong leadership preparedness and 
performance. When people assume new leadership responsibilities, they frequently fail to recognise the ways in which 
their previous roles have evolved. They may not realise that their jobs are no longer merely mechanical but instead 
involve assisting others in achieving their goals; that driving the bus may require them to take a backseat; or that

Abstract 
 
Winning in today’s competitive scenario requires top-quality talent. We also know what it takes to build that talent 
pipeline and how much organizations spend on significant financial and human resources to make it happen. However, 
many business organizations that are elegantly planned and have procedures that have been well benchmarked may 
not transfer into a depth of talent at the bottom of the pyramid. Why? This article argues that organizations seeking to 
maximize the value of talent need to act in radically new ways. The author, who has worked as a talent nurturing 
professional with multinational corporations, has attempted to focus on the problems that new hires face, particularly 
those in the entry-level managerial cadre, and has attempted to present a new blueprint for assimilating talent as soon 
as it enters the organization and making the most of it through the writing of this article. The effort is to show how 
talent assimilation initiatives can be made robust and impactful, bringing enormous value and arresting untimely 
departures of talent.

Abstract 
 
The previous research applied the Artificial Immune System Algorithm in job shop scheduling with five jobs and three 
machines with a makespan result of 61.15 time-units. The algorithm is considered inaccurate because it requires 
complicated steps for operators to understand, such as determining random numbers of initialization and clones, donor 
seeds, and repetition of gene fragments to produce a smaller makespan. The proposed algorithm is derived from the 
Non-delay Algorithm with a modification in the form of ranking based on the criteria of the earliest start time, the 
earliest finish time, the longest remaining total processing time, and the total remaining operations. Modifications are 
also made by giving the priority order of machines based on the most used machines in each operation. The results 
showed that the proposed algorithm could shorten makespan by 3.99% to 57.16 time-units with a reliability percentage 
of 55.55%. The proposed algorithm gave the same or better results in the first ten cases with two to six jobs. The small 
number of jobs and machines resulting in a small combination of scheduling sequences and cases that might be 
resolved optimally on the reference data. The proposed algorithm could not give a shorter makespan result in the 
eleventh to eighteenth cases with more than six jobs. The proposed algorithm only provided one scheduling sequence, 
with the advantage of being a few easy steps.

1. Introduction 
Production scheduling is one of the main activities in the manufacturing industry. In production scheduling, there is 
an activity of dividing jobs into available machines or workstations. This activity requires an algorithm or steps in the 
preparation that might determine the makespan or total completion time. Makespan will affect the speed of job 
completion or product delivery. Using the proper steps, methods, or algorithms can reduce makespan to enable the 
next job to be started earlier. 
Astuti (2013) applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) Algorithm to minimize the overall time used in job shop 
scheduling, which produced a makespan of 61.15 minutes. This study was accomplished at PT. Aneka Adhilogam 
Karya. The company was initially established in 1968 and is currently engaged in metal casting, producing pipe fittings 
with gray cast iron and ductile cast iron specifications. It produces five kinds of products: the collar, flange socket, 
flange spigot, giboult joint, and clamp saddle by three machines, namely lathes, drills, and hand grinders. The 
algorithm application above is considered relatively complex as they applied random numbers to the initialization 
stage, clone, and donor seed and re-calculate to aim lower makespan.  
A simple job shop problem with five jobs on three machines can be solved with the Non-Delay (ND) Algorithm. The 
advantage of this algorithm is the relatively easy processing process by scheduling work based on the earliest start 
time. However, the makespan result using the ND Algorithm can give a longer result than applying the AIS Algorithm. 
Based on the above problems, modifying the ND Algorithm to minimize the makespan with more straightforward

The comparison of the settlement results between the proposed algorithm and other case data is used to check the 
algorithm's reliability in providing a shorter makespan. The proposed algorithm can give the same or better results in 
the first ten cases out of 18 cases with a reliability percentage of 55.55%. The first ten cases have two to six jobs. In 
11 to 18 cases, the proposed algorithm cannot give better or comparable results than makespan in the source case. 
Cases 11 to 18 have many jobs totaling seven to 10 jobs. 
 
In two jobs, the proposed algorithm gives the same results as the makespan data derived from the data source. It has 
occurred because the number of jobs is small. Therefore, the possibility of changing positions for scheduling between 
jobs is limited. Furthermore, in three jobs, the proposed algorithm gave better results in case fourth. In cases with four, 
five, and six jobs, the proposed algorithm can produce a better makespan than the makespan from the case data, except 
in the case by Fisher and Thompson (1963) with six jobs; the proposed algorithm produces the same makespan which 
is 55.00 time-units. A previous study by Thamilselvan and Balasubramanie (2011) used a genetic algorithm, while 
Kurdi (2015) used the Island Migration Algorithm, like the genetic algorithm using random numbers to determine 
scheduling sequences. The case of Prasetyo et al. (2015) also applied random numbers to scheduling work. Thus, the 
resulting schedule does not necessarily produce the best or the shortest makespan.  
 
If the number of jobs is more than seven, the proposed algorithm cannot give similar or better results. The more jobs 
that must be scheduled and the number of machines available, the more combinations can occur for scheduling. In this 
case, the proposed algorithm with criteria such as earliest start time, shortest completion time, longest remaining 
processing time, and the highest number of remaining operations gives a sequence that results in a makespan longer 
than makespan from the case data. Thus, for cases with a many number of jobs with vast combinations, the algorithm 
with random numbers can produce a shorter makespan. However, the algorithm with random numbers must go through 
a certain amount of work to get good results. It is different from the proposed algorithm, which only requires one 
work, although the results are not necessarily the best. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the conducted research, it could be concluded that the proposed algorithm can provide a shorter makespan 
compared to Astuti (2013) by 3,99%, from 61,15 time-units to 57,16-time units. Applying the proposed algorithm in 
eighteen cases with a different number of jobs has a reliability percentage of 55,55%. The proposed algorithm produces 
the same or shorter makespan for the first ten cases, with fewer jobs between two and six jobs. The proposed algorithm

could not provide a better or the same result for the cases with more than seven jobs, which generate a high number 
of possible combinations. Therefore, it is better to apply an algorithm with random numbers as the generator.

Abstract 
During 2017 Hurricane Maria destroyed the island of Puerto Rico. Most of the damage and loss of the people were 
due to the poor preparation and decision making of individuals. The concept of the iWiLL application is to aid in 
individual decision-making during emergencies. In the application, the user has the option of choosing an event under 
different categories that has occurred to him/her or their surroundings during and after a hurricane. After, the 
application will provide some recommendations so that the individual can make a sound decision. To be able to 
quantify and observe the wellness of the user in the application, the team developed a calculation for wellness. This 
is seen as a maximized inventory by taking into consideration detrimental effects, meaning reducing an 
individual’s wellness, and restorative actions, which mean choosing a solution for the situation presented. The user 
then has the option to share the information which will be sent via the ViSER website to first responders so that they 
can aid users for each of the individual situations that are present.

Abstract 
 
South Korea perceived its soft power as weaker than its economic standing and military capacity. Hence, the 
government is allocating substantial resources to improve the national image through public diplomacy, which 
incorporates culture, knowledge, and policy. The current pandemic provides some sort of silver lining for South 
Korea as it is perceived successful in flattening the curve without a lockdown. Using an expert survey, our study 
finds that COVID-19 has become a game changer for South Korea’s public diplomacy. The regional cooperation 
projects with ASEAN and bilateral assistance programs significantly support South Korea’s “New Southern 
Policy”, which was announced in 2017. This study offers important insights as to how South Korean soft power 
is perceived by a developing country such as Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
Foreign workers make up a substantial portion of the labor force in developed countries and emerging markets' 
hospitality industries. Hence, managing international employees has received the attention of scholars and 
multinational companies in this field. The goal of this study is to examine the association between the foreign workers' 
perceived organizational support (POS), cross-cultural adjustment, and job performance. This study used structural 
equation modeling to analyze sample data of ninety-nine hospitality workers from Indonesia who were mainly living 
and working in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. The result of the study indicated that perceived organizational 
support positively influences cross-cultural adjustment. Also, the cross-cultural adjustment has been found to 
positively influences workers' job performance. Interestingly, this study found that there was an association between 
perceived organizational support and job performance. Lastly, cross-cultural adjustment moderates the relationship 
between perceived organizational support and workers' job performance. This research is one of the first studies that 
examine the Indonesian hospitality foreign workers’ perception of organizational support, cross-cultural adjustment, 
and job performance. Our findings shed a new perspective on one antecedent of foreign workers’ job performance. 
Our findings also serve to elucidate the roles of cross-cultural adjustment in a multicultural workplace.

6. Conclusion 
This study aims to examine the relationship between Perceived Organizational Support (POS), cross-culture 
adjustment, and job performance among foreign workers in the hospitality industry in Australia. This study found a 
significant positive relationship between POS and cross-cultural adjustment, POS, and workers' job performance. A 
meta-analysis study examining the relationship between Perceived Organizational Support and job performance 
conducted by Riggle et al. (2009) found that there was a significant positive relationship between these variables. This 
finding was supported by Shen et al. (2014) who also found a significant positive relationship between perceived 
organizational support and expatriates’ job performance. 
 
However, the current study found that there was no significant relationship between foreign workers’ perception of 
organizational support and their job performance. This result was not expected. Many Indonesian hospitality workers 
in Australia experienced culture shock as a result of their work. The contrasts between their home and host countries 
usually cause tension and bewilderment. Miscommunication due to a language barrier may also cause frustration 
among these workers. Managers and local staff, for example, may utilize slang language that Indonesian workers do 
not understand. Furthermore, inequalities in cultural power distance (Hofstede, 2011; Khatri, 2009) may have an 
impact on Indonesian workers' cross-cultural adjustment. To put it another way, when the host country is more 
culturally distant, it is more difficult to adjust (Wang & Varma, 2019). This may result in a situation in which the 
hospitality company's support is viewed differently by Indonesian hospitality workers, negatively impacting their job 
performance. On the contrary, if these workers have a high level of cross-cultural adjustment, workplace cultural 
misunderstanding can be reduced. In other words, the cross-cultural adjustment will increase the poor link between 
Perceived Organizational Support and Job Performance, thus, this study supported hypothesis 4 (H4). 
 
The findings of this study have several implications. First, the research has contributed to the organizational and social 
exchange theories, as well as other fields. This study integrates the variables perceived organizational support, cross-
cultural adjustment, and job performance in order to examine the social interchange between Indonesian hospitality 
foreign workers in Australia. Despite the importance of foreign workers in the hospitality business, past research on 
migrant worker POS, CCA, and job performance has been limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
that examines these topics, especially in the context of Indonesian foreign workers in the hospitality industry. 
Second, the hospitality businesses that employ foreign workers should be more focused on cultural training at the 
work induction program. Also, hospitality managers should be aware that every employee who comes from many 
different cultural backgrounds may misinterpret the form of support due to cultural differences. Hence, it is crucial to 
conduct feedback sessions at the beginning of employment, either formally or informally. 
 
At the last, for the future research it is recommended that the findings of the current study be tested on other foreign 
workers from different countries. The comparison study also would be required to differentiate the result based on the 
nation's culture. Lastly, since this study relies on quantitative data, which lacks certain amounts of perceptive 
information, qualitative data would be significantly important to be explored.

Abstract 
This research intends to examine the strategies used by SMEs during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study also 
designed a future business model using a Business Model Canvas (BMC) approach for SMEs and was analyzed using 
a qualitative method. The data was collected through an in-depth interview with the respondents: owner, customer, 
marketing officer, and supplier.  The results showed that the company’s value propositions began to create new images 
in the eyes of its customers. The value proposition includes high-quality raw materials, the characteristic in selecting 
colors and leather types, simple and elegant design, relatively standard prices, and involving the surrounding 
community in the production process to create an empowered and independent society. Regarding the channel, the 
company used online media as a marketing tool for transactions, such as marketplace, social media, and admin sales. 
Revenue streams are no longer sourced only from the sale of SMEs products online and through social media but also 
from the dropship, resellers, vendors, and offline sales (bazaar, workshops, and exhibitions). Concerning the key 
resources, adequate equipment was used to reach maximum results. Besides, manufacturing products manually or 
using machines to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of production are the activities added to the element of 
key activities. The key partnership added was a permanent supplier for the companies, easing them in obtaining their 
raw materials. Finally, in terms of cost structure, the new value added by the company was to provide discounts for 
resellers and SMEs dropship suppliers who purchased products.

The New Colombo Plan (NCP) program was launched by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) 
in 2014. It aims to enhance Australia’s public diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific region, whilst sending Australian 
students to learn in various countries, including Indonesia More than 2,000 Australian students have been studying 
in Indonesia under the NCP scheme, however, little is known about how this opportunity is improving Australia’s 
public diplomacy in its nearest neighbour. Using survey and interview approaches, this paper examines the 
experiences of Australian students in conducting the NCP program in Indonesia between 2018 and 2020. The 
findings suggest that students have excellent experience during their time in Indonesia, and the program has been 
instrumental in improving Australia’s public diplomacy in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
At the time of writing this article, Indonesian health system has collapsed due to the spread of COVID-19. As a close 
neighbour to Indonesia, Australia is reflecting the importance of Indonesia in its news coverage. How do Australian 
newspapers report Indonesia’s struggle in tackling the health crisis? This paper aims to answer that question by 
examining seven Australian dailies, including two nationally distributed papers and five state-based media. The 
findings indicate that stories on COVID-19 in Indonesia are dominated by travel restriction, vaccines, and corruption 
scandals. In particular, the Australian press tends to highlight the lack of strong leadership during the current pandemic. 
In addition, some minor topics emerged such as the release of an Islamic cleric, natural disasters, and a plane crash. 
The framing of terrorism continues to display how the Australian media is portraying Indonesia as a hotbed for 
radicalisation.

1. Introduction  
The spread of COVID-19 has received worldwide attention since early 2020. Molla (2020) reported how Coronavirus 
took over social media with the number of articles with coronavirus-related terms have exploded, with nearly 20 
million on March 11. The Google Trend also shows how coronavirus search volume replaced Trump, music, and 
video. Citing Simon Rogers, a data editor on the News Lab team at Google, ""people are not panicking, but they just 
want to know how long they have to wash their hands"" (Molla 2020). This exponential growth of the number of 
searches may lead readers to ""infodemic."" Infodemic means too much information, including false or misleading 
information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak (World Health Organization 2020). The 
solution to prevent infodemic during a pandemic is ""risk communication."" Risk Communication refers to the real-time 
exchange of information, advice, and opinions between experts (World Health Organization 2020). This type of 
communication provides education and protective behaviors (Gesser-Edelsburg et al. 2014). 
 
Infodemic also took place in a relatively advanced economy such as Australia. A report by the University of Canberra 
(2021) suggests that general concern about false and misleading information online in Australia is high (64%), and 
much higher than the global average (56%). Almost 60 percent of Australians also say they encountered 
misinformation in the last week. Experience of misinformation about COVID-19 was the highest (38%) followed by 
politics (33%) and climate change (23%). The report also finds local news continues to be an important part of 
Australia’s news diet, confirming a significant role of local newspapers in generating a sense of community.

2439","least quoted are ambassadors and commoners--with less than 5 citations. As many as 23 articles have no quotes from 
any individual, meaning the stories were not referring to a specific position at all. 
 
From the framing analysis, travel restriction is dominating the news coverage of COVID-19 in Indonesia with most 
quoted sources being ministers explaining policies on border control. Another prominent topic is vaccines as the 
Indonesian government is prioritising the national vaccination program as the solution to curb the pandemic. 
Epidemiologists and public health experts were heavily cited in articles on vaccines as the government is planning to 
roll out as early as 13 January of 2021. 
 
5. Conclusion  
There is no doubt that Indonesia is one of the most important neighbours for Australia, both in the security and 
economic aspects. However, the interest to report how Indonesia is dealing with the current pandemic is far from 
adequate. This study has demonstrated that in the last 12 months, articles on COVID-19 in Indonesia comprise only 
177 collected from seven Australian newspapers. Echoing Tapsell’s (2021) assertion, the Australian press is far more 
inclined to report what is happening in the US or the UK, rather than its neighbouring countries.  
 
This study argues that the way the Australian press is framing COVID-19 in Indonesia is determined by its readers. 
For example, the West Australian newspaper tends to report on trade relations since their readers are dominated by 
farmers and those working in the agricultural sector. Hence, it is expected that the news coverage will be dominated 
by how the current pandemic and travel restriction will be resulting in significantly lower cattle exports. Meanwhile, 
other dailies tend to exaggerate terrorism and the potential security threats following the release of an Islamic cleric. 
Again, news coverage in Indonesia is associated with terrorism using harmful stereotypes. The framing of issues 
related to the Bali bombing continue to utilise an Orientalist approach (Mahony, 2010), reflecting Australia’s racist 
past and its fear of terrorism. 
 
Some caveats of this study include the type of media observed that only focus on printed newspapers. In a digital era, 
this might probably exclude a vast population who are now more relying on social media or other digital platforms 
for news feeds. However, the current paper remains important as it provides the first examination on how the 
Australian press are reporting Indonesia’s struggle in tackling the spread of COVID-19. Future research could expand 
this analysis by looking at different media platforms or to compare Indonesia with other Southeast Asian countries 
with similar levels of importance to Australia.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 spread rapidly and infects many countries which caused China to receive criticism from several 
countries, one of which is the United States, which accused China of being the source of the outbreak and hid the 
information about the outbreak of the Coronavirus. This makes China do everything possible to counter the 
accusations that they are the source of the outbreak and try to rebuild its positive image. China started conducting 
digital diplomacy through Twitter, which we will call ‘Chinese Twiplomacy’. This study aims to examine China’s 
efforts to counter negative narratives during COVID-19 pandemic. It finds that China has been used bot accounts 
to boost their persona online by multiple strategies such as donations of medical supplies overseas to frame its 
image as a responsible global leader and offering some cash to the Chinese influencers to post positive messages.

1. Introduction  
The World Health Organization (2020) declared in December 2019 the outbreak of respiratory diseases caused 
by the new coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The COVID-19 spread rapidly and infects 
many countries which caused China to receive criticism from several countries, particularly the USA, which 
accused China of being the source of the outbreak and hid the information about the outbreak of the Coronavirus. 
Rizky (2020) suggests that China is faced with the possibility of domestic social and economic upheaval, the 
Regime cannot let this issue affecting negatively to its geopolitical influence. Alden and Chan (2021) examine 
the three possible intertwined reasons for China to conduct a digital diplomacy offensive through Twitter. The 
first reason is that Twitter enables China to reach an international audience rapidly and effectively, also Twitter 
has the hashtag feature that facilitates seeing content related to it. The second reason is Twitter allows China to 
look after and gauge international public opinion. The third reason why China uses Twitter officially is because 
its governments can easily recognize the impact that the platform offers related to public diplomacy and pushing 
back the negative narratives online, despite the fact that China previously was not proactive in using Twitter.  
 
Farras (2019) reported that China is also known to have many laws and regulations prohibiting inappropriate and 
illegal online content introduced by the Cyber Administration of China (CAC) in November 2018 ordering all 
social media platforms that can upload short videos, live streaming, any kind of microblog, to periodically assess 
their risk when it comes to mass mobilization, even China has a complex network of internet filtering systems as 
known as the Great Firewall which is used to block access to thousands of foreign websites, consequently the 
online daily newspaper The New York. The Times and social networks like Google, Twitter and Facebook are 
banned in China. Even China has made alternative applications for the platforms they banned, for example Baidu 
for Google, Weibo for Twitter, and iQiyi for Netflix, and several other Chinese brands.  
 
Nurbaya (2017) examine the reason why China banned Twitter and other Western social media in their country, 
so that Chinese people won't protest on social media that can quickly trigger other Chinese people, the applications

Chinese companies such as Huawei, Alibaba, and Baidu. Moreover, ProPublica discovered that there is a tool that 
can be used to send messages in bulk across a number of accounts on Western social media platforms. This tool 
is used by China Daily's official Twitter account. During the epidemic in China, many accounts became 
cheerleaders for the government, calling on citizens to unite in support of efforts to fight the epidemic and urging 
them to “dispel online rumours”. These accounts have sought to promote the Chinese government's image 
overseas and shore up its domestic support. One typical recent tweet in Chinese stated: “We are not afraid during 
the outbreak because our country is our rear-guard. Many warriors fighting disease were pushed to the front line. 
Even more volunteers are helping in seemingly trivial but important ways.”  
 
The third example is an account that has now been suspended by Twitter, namely an account named Melinda 
Butler, which is suspected of being a fake account that was deliberately created. The account posts about the 
Coronavirus, sometimes in a mixed language of simplified Chinese and traditional characters. ProPublica suspects 
Butler's account is fake because of many things - suspicious things, for example even though the account looks 
like it was created by someone named Melinda Butler, profile photo showing a middle-aged Chinese woman 
wearing a beige baseball cap, which this photo can be found all over the internet, ProPublica found it in a 
horoscope and product promotion spam account on the social networking site Weibo. Butler's account was newly 
created in January 2020, and does not provide any personal or biographical information, does not follow anyone 
on Twitter and has only one follower for its obsessive posts about the Coronavirus outbreak. During the last few 
weeks of research, ProPublica still got a record of the proposition that some prominent Chinese Twitter users 
(influencers) got an offer from a fake account. The fake account offered a sum of money aimed at users with more 
than 10,000 followers to promote videos of Wuhan's battle against the coronavirus ""in the public interest."" Another 
offer came from a “cultural promotion media marketing agency” account that contained a photo of Japanese 
actress Kasumi Arimura asking users to post a text, accompanied by a photo or video (all provided by the agency) 
for 400 to 2500 renminbi (approximately $60 to $360) per post.  
 
Another account that calls itself an “international cultural exchange” company offers 1,700 renminbi (about $240) 
per post to the Australian-Chinese artist Badiucao. This political dissident has nearly 70,000 followers on Twitter. 
After a day of negotiating with the company, he obtained and shared with ProPublica a sample 15-second 
propaganda video clip. The video is trying to show that the Chinese government has defeated the coronavirus and 
that everything is back on track. ""This is what Chinese propagandists call a 'wave of positive energy'. Badiucao 
believes, based on their interactions, that the company he communicates with, works for the Chinese government. 
Badiucao speculated that the company used social media monitoring tools to identify their targets (evidence shows 
they reached out to Chinese-speaking Twitter users who have more than 10,000 followers). China’s efforts that 
Propublica has discovered appear to be aimed at a different audience overseas. Most of the posts found are in 
Chinese and appear to be aimed at influencing the millions of overseas Chinese, as well as to shape and control 
international public opinion. Some studies have supported that in carrying out its propaganda on Twitter, China 
attempts to use fake and suspicious accounts to boost its diplomats Twitter activities whether to like every post 
issued by a Chinese party account or retweet the posts (Carnegie Mellon University study, 2020; Stanford Internet 
Observatory study, 2020; Anne-Marie Brady, 2020; Wang, et al., 2020; Kao and Li, 2020). Although of China's 
presence, especially its “Wolf-Warriors” has been more proactive in past one half years, especially during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, China's influence on Twitter is still less than the other of world leaders, particularly in Asia, 
for example Foreign Minister of Philippines Teddy Locsin Jr, who is in the first place on the social rankings of 
“The 50 Most Active World Leaders”, and PM Narendra Modi’s India account which is in the top two of “the 50 
Most Followed Leaders” after Donald Trump. 
 
4. Conclusion  
This paper has demonstrated that COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly makes China do everything possible to 
counter the accusations that they are the source of the outbreak and try to rebuild its positive image. It started 
conducting a digital diplomacy offensive on Twitter that has become China's ‘channel of choice’ for digital 
diplomacy and was previously known not proactive in using Twitter. The involvement of the Chinese government 
in social media Twitter shows that digital diplomacy can make a real contribution to crisis management, both in 
the form of disseminating information to the public and in supporting communication between countries. The 
current pandemic has emphasized the importance of digital diplomacy skills in efforts to deal with crises, 
especially through Twitter which ultimately forces every state leader or representative to adapt to current 
development. Chinese’s aggressive tweets showed up when it comes to replying all the negative narratives on 
Twitter, that well carried out by its “Wolf-Warriors”. Which from the previous studies China used bot accounts

Abstract 
 
This article examines Indonesia's role as a middle power in the Katowice Climate Change Conference or COP-24. To 
voice developing countries’ interest, Indonesia has pursued three important negotiation points toward developed 
countries in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement namely financial support, technology transfer, and 
capacity building. To overcome tension between developed and developing countries, Indonesia has mobilized its 
middle power status particularly in the importance of developed countries to fulfil their commitments to developing 
countries. During the negotiation, Indonesian negotiators seek to use the middle power position symbolically as a 
negotiating power and become representatives of other developing countries to reach a negotiating agreement at 
COP24. This can be seen in Indonesia’s ability to create a narrative of symbolic power in the form of language, and 
identity, which is able to convince developed countries to agree with Indonesia's demands. This article then contributes 
to the middle power literature by bringing the discussion of symbolic power into the discussion.

1. Introduction 
Many literature have established the importance of middle power in regional and global order (Beeson & Higgott, 
2014; Blaxekjær, 2015; Cooper, 2011). Most studies show that due to its limited capacity, middle power's primary 
roles mainly revolve around mediator, facilitator and bridge builder, emphasizing multilateralism (Holbraad, 1971; 
Pandey & Watson, 2014; Siwon, 2015). This middle power diplomacy then focuses on diplomacy that put 
forward technical competence, effective communication, and moral suasion (Cooper, 2011). Such focus on small 
number functional niches would allow middle power to concentrate their resources.   
 
One crucial agenda in which the middle power has shown greater interest and leadership is in multilateral negotiations 
of the climate change issue (Dimitrov, 2010). Countries such as Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia and South Korea 
have shown a greater roles in many international for a concerning in climate change issue (Hochstetler & Milkoreit, 
2015; Siwon, 2015). Most studies of a middle power in climate change focus on the use of coalition-building as well 
as network position as s diplomatic strategy to take advantage of increasingly decentralizing power (Patience, 2014; 
Watson, 2015). Through the establishment of Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), South Korea able to create a 
coalition for a middle power to be able to oppose large powers and lay down its demands also win the international 
society’s approval (Kim, 2016, p. 149). Watson (2015) further shows how middle powers are creating their own

2463","at COP-24. As a middle power country, Indonesia have putting its role as a negotiator, mediator and bridging dialogue 
through negotiations between developed and developing countries. With the concept of symbolic strength, which is 
language and identity, Indonesia constructs a narrative of symbolic power that is able to give birth to interaction in 
social space. Indonesia is able to voice its concerns to other developing countries because of its status as a middle 
power. Its aim is to promote the financial assistance, technical transfers, and capacity building, which are needed to 
assist developing countries to implement the Paris Agreement program (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Three point of negotiation 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this article shows that Indonesia is trying to use the middle power as a symbolic tool to increase its 
interest in COP-24 in Katowice in 2018. By analyzing Indonesia's role in the Katowice conference shows that it has 
always reaffirmed the importance of developing countries. This repetition shows that Indonesia is trying to provide a 
social space that aims to create space for developed countries to support developing countries in fighting climate 
change. As a middle power, Indonesia symbolically represents the identity of a developing country. Indonesia through 
the delegation of Indonesia voiced three important issues that became problems for developing countries in 
implementing the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. 
 
 
From the results of negotiations between the Indonesian side through The Delegation of Indonesia at COP-24, several 
findings were produced. First, Indonesia uses the status of middle power to play its role as a negotiator, mediator and 
also to bridge dialogue in voicing the interests of developing countries in the issue of climate change. Second, all of 
Indonesia's three negotiating points during COP-24 were successfully voiced. However, not all points have the 
expected outcome. Financial support is easier for developed countries to fulfill, compared to technology transfer and 
capacity building. It is because technology support and capacity building must be adapted to the different of ""gaps"" 
and ""needs"" of each country. Thus, many developed countries are still considering and need time to review these two 
points compared to financial support. 
 
 
Moving forward, this article only focus on the COP-24 multilateral climate change conference held in Katowice in 
2018. This will be a good avenue for further research on the role of middle powers at the next conference. Basically, 
every year the UNFCCC always holds a regular conference in one of its member countries. This article does not really 
look from the side of other countries, it only focuses on the role of Indonesia during the climate change negotiation 
process at COP-24. Hence, it would be better if someone explores the role of other middle power countries in the 
climate change conference so that they can produce a detailed and specific justification for the role of the middle 
powers.

Abstract 
 
This research seeks to explain shared challenges and opportunities in ending the high rate of child marriage in two 
South Asian countries, namely India and Bangladesh. Both countries are listed with the highest absolute numbers of 
child marriage in the world with 15.6 million and 4.4 million cases respectively recorded in 2019. By analyzing 20 
papers published in the last 10 years, this study identifies a couple of similarities in factors that drive the prevalence 
of child marriage in India and Bangladesh. Studies pointing to the importance of government and non-government 
interventions as well as the efforts in improving education as strategies to combat the trend of underage marriage. The 
findings offer generalizability to the wider region and beyond. It is also important to note that some policy 
recommendations can be applicable to be implemented in countries with similar socioeconomic status.

Abstract  
 
Culturally based habits and expectations influence learning. Identifying these cultural expectations is a 
prerequisite for designing learning environments that best serve students. This research studied the behavior of 
university students in the greater Jakarta area using the model of culture. The model of culture was an extension 
from Hall’s model, and consists of eight dimensions, i.e., time focus, time orientation, power, competition, action, 
space, communication, and structure. 1207 responses from different universities in the greater Jakarta area were 
collected and analyzed using two-stage cluster analysis (combination of Ward method and K-means clustering). 
The result shows three clusters, namely: the millennial engineers, the diffused social studies students, and the 
silent achiever. Different teaching tools were then suggested for each cluster to address their weaknesses and 
strengths.

1. Introduction 
Culture influences our way of life, including in the education sector.  Culture can influence the way students share 
information and skills amongst their peers (Alothman et al., 2017). In the context of higher education, students 
have the opportunity to develop their social skills allowing them to learn beyond just technical competencies 
(Farber, 2014). In addressing their long-term plans, it is crucial for students to acquire the right aspect of culture 
and how to deal with other people (Zabadi and Al-Alawi, 2016). To make students better prepared for professional 
work, it is important to address soft skill and social growth in addition to academic growth (Rigden, 2019). 
Without the right cultivated culture, student learning can lead to dropouts that can impact long term educational 
goals (Abdul Kareem Al-Mansoob, 2018). On the contrary, positive culture building during the learning process 
can stimulate more gain for both teachers and students (Chen, 2018). Culture of peer coaching can be crucial to 
give better exposure and dealing with tasks during the learning process. Students with an open culture embrace 
more new innovations in the learning process (Mazur, 2010). 
 
The inherited culture from students' backgrounds also plays an important role. For example, in collectivist culture, 
a sense of trust within society triggers an initiative to pull resources into a shared purpose (Yakaboski et al., 2017). 
In the end, the students' cultural background and the culture of the schools they attend influence the quality of 
learning experiences (O’Sullivan et al., 2019). This makes it necessary to embrace diversity in the teacher’s 
composition (Keane and Heinz, 2016; Villegas and Irvine., 2010). 
 
With the advancement of technology, students' behavior in the learning process has formed different cultural 
behavior and habits (Spathopoulou, 2019). With e-learning platforms, students' opportunities become wider and 
beyond spatial, social and economic constraints (Zabadi and Al-Alawi, 2016). 
Attention and transformation have been done in the education field to address quality, equity, and diversity. 
Creative teaching strategies must be developed to address diversity inherited in students’ needs. This will

2477","For cluster 1 we suggested to mix individual and group work as tools in the learning process. Group work can 
enhance more creativity and better result from group thinking and discussion as most of them have polychronic 
traits. Nevertheless, the learning style must still acknowledge the individual performance. This can be done by 
assigning several accomplished students as group leaders or agents for change for their peers as a source of 
inspiration for excellence. 
 
For cluster 2, learning plan and strategy should stress more on groupworks and collaboration in the class, to cater 
to their collectivism traits and desire for cooperation. The collaboration can be done either within groups or within 
classes, in such a way students get engage and take more initiative so we can see their implicit aspiration. The 
collaboration mechanism should also involve more “future orientation” elements to assist them sharpen their 
analytical mind. 
 
Cluster 3 is actually the easiest to be managed. They are independent, mature, explicit, and aware of the 
importance of the learning and studying process for themselves. Lecturers can make use of this cluster as the 
change agents to help stimulate their peers (especially those in cluster 2) during the learning process, while 
assisting them to gain experience and expertise as group leaders and/or moderators. Lecturers may need to 
explicitly acknowledge their role as group leaders to ensure they are respected by their peers so collaboration can 
take place. By involving them as group leaders, this cluster can soften their competition behavior in lieu of leading 
expertise. 
 
Although we should apply different teaching styles to suit the preferred style of each cluster, learning behavior 
can be dynamic over time. It is therefore still beneficial for students to be introduced and profited from different 
learning strategies that may require them to develop openness to alternative learning styles. By experiencing 
different learning styles over time, students learn to be adaptable to a variety of environments after completing 
their degree, which help them to be more mature and ready for professional work. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Despite being the millennial generation, students have different cultures and preferences in the learning 
environment. The eight dimensions of the model of culture is a suitable tool to capture these differences. Three 
clusters of students identified in the study which gain insights into requirement and possibility for further 
improvement. As also mentioned by other previous scholars, the cultural assessment is not a static one, and can 
evolve over time. With that spirit, learning approaches and tools can be exercised in accordance with students' 
preferred style in order to form a better learning experience for the students.  
 
In general millennial students in the greater Jakarta area still require a teacher role as experts, despite more 
acceptance for a less hierarchical structure and diffuse environment. They are less future oriented, which need to 
be improved in order to prepare them for the business environment. The 1st cluster shows a good sign where 
engineering students show a more polychronic behavior which can help boost creativity and better result. The 2nd 
cluster, where most of the social science students are, need to improve in “future” orientation in their learning 
process. The 3rd cluster, which is most of the students, shows a promising trend in terms of awareness for 
achievement. The next task is to encourage creativity in the learning process to make it better.  
 
The study proposed a preferred learning strategy for each cluster as guidance. With the preferred and more suitable 
learning strategy, both lecturers and students can get an effective teaching-learning experience. Nevertheless, 
openness and exposure to different styles could also later be exercised to give them diverse and open learning 
experience. 
 
The study has limitations in form of sampling, as it only uses convenience and snowball sampling. A wider 
sampling coverage and/or a longitudinal study can enhance as future opportunity to capture a better dynamic of 
student requirement

Abstract 
 
Colonialism left a big impact on power relations at the social level. One of the most prominent is the ideology of 
“colorism” which sees a person’s position and ranking based on racial features and skin color, thus created racial 
hierarchy. The problem is, this indication is still happening today, the lifetime of Generation Z (Gen-Z) who was 
born in the 21st century, when the world has become increasingly converged by globalization and easy access to 
information. The “ideology” of colorism still persists by placing the white race as a race that is considered superior 
and has higher privileges compared to the “indigenous” race. But we wanted to explore whether the same trend 
holds true for Gen-Z of white and “indigenous” descent. Through the Postcolonial approach, we conducted a 
survey of 152 respondents and semi-structured interviews of mixed race and “indigenous” people in Jakarta and 
found that the colorism tendency only applies to those who are fully “white”, but not fully to mixed races. 
However, this mixed race still gets a lot of benefits from this racial condition, as well as often finds discrimination.

1. Introduction 
After colonialism, the Western beauty standard is still imprinted until now in the time of Z Generation (Gen-Z), 
the current generations that will likely be more active in the scene of global politics (Dolot, 2018).  Social media 
such as Tiktok, Instagram, and Twitter helps Gen-Z, through beauty influencers, to associate their beauty to the 
Western ideals of beauty, marked by brighter and lighter skin and hair tone. This Western ideal of beauty is 
socially, culturally, and even politically privileged, and creating a certain kind of superiority of particular races  
(Golby et al., 2001; Ross, 1901).  
 
Gen-Z is also not immune from this tendency. In the case of Indonesia, as exemplified by research by Tanu (2017) 
who conducted an interview in one of the international schools located in Jakarta, where some of the respondents 
are mixed whether half white half Indonesia or half white half Oriental, one of the respondents answered that she 
would rather be called white than Indonesian. Her caucasian father told her that she’s mixed but she still refused 
to be called like that and persisted to be called ‘bule’, and Indonesian term for foreign descent that considerably 
seen as an “upper race” (Tanu, 2017: 216). From an interview with Hannah Al Rasyid who is mixed French 
Indonesian that was conducted by Magdalene explained that being mixed-race is a pride to herself since the 
stereotype benefited her. Soap operas in Indonesia also shows this tendency, as well as beauty pageant events that 
several times wins people with mixed Caucasian race. For example, the winner of Puteri Indonesia (Miss 
Indonesia) 2019 was Frederika Alexis Cull who represented DKI Jakarta is a British-Batavian descendant (CNN, 
2019). She was also protruding in the Miss Universe by occupy the top 10 spot which is higher than any Indonesian 
(“natives”) representative ever sent to the same events.

2489","On the other hand, she is also aware that those kinds of actions that she received can be harmful to other students 
and can create jealousy between her and other people. On the other hand, Wenny, our next respondent, was also 
aware of that privilege but she did not feel like it was necessary to think more about the special treat. She is one 
of those people who think normatively that she is as equal as any other people regarding any races.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Postcolonialism discusses the issue of power relations between people with white racial backgrounds who are 
often considered to have privileges in society. This issue then emerged as an “ideology” of colorism, which placed 
the privilege only on the basis of differences in skin color and racial features. This is supported by the embodiment 
of this mentality into social practices that preserve the racial and color-based social system of colonial heritage, 
even long after the practice of colonialism ended. In the case we studied, this tendency is still passed down to the 
generation born in the 2000s or 21s century, otherwise known as Gen-Z. 
 
By taking samples of Gen-Z aged 18-25 years from Jakarta, we conclude that this colorism tendency still persists 
until this research is made. Both the MR and NM groups realized that the superiority of the white race could be 
clearly iterated. But the same thing is not fully felt and experienced by MR. As a figure who is only half white, 
they are still often discriminated, although not to a destructive level, as is the discrimination between the Hutu 
and Tutsi races in Rwanda. In fact, often this discrimination does not occur in a negative sense, it even tends to 
benefit them in their social relations. However, we realize that this study is still too early to conclude more 
comprehensively on the tendency of colorism and colonial privilege inheritance, given the unrepresentative 
sample size and the limited survey area in Jakarta. Further studies need to be carried out to obtain a more accurate 
picture of this phenomenon in various regions in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
This paper discusses the joint border management of United Kingdom and France in dealing with the illegal 
immigrants’ issue which creates Calais Jungle phenomenon in Calais, France. Calais Jungle is an illegal camp area to 
build to accommodate the large number of immigrants who entered France with the aim of going to the United 
Kingdom. Most of them who were unable to enter United Kingdom are survived in the Calais Jungle camp. The 
increasing number of immigrants who come and occupy the camp creates its own problems. As France considered 
United Kingdom as the destination country for those immigrants, this country must also be responsible for solving 
this problem together. Therefore, the cooperation between the two countries is considerable to overcoming the Calais 
Jungle phenomenon. This paper uses international cooperation theory to analyse the Effectiveness of Joint Border 
Management in the UK and France in 2003-2016.  Using descriptive qualitative techniques and it is supported by 
secondary data. The results of this study provide an explanation of the effectiveness of joint border management 
carried out by United Kingdom and France in dealing with the phenomenon of illegal immigrants.

Abstract 
 
This article continues to expand the examination on women’s representation in the media during the COVID-19 
pandemic by bringing the perspective of Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country. With women 
greatly impacted by the pandemic from health, economic, and social standpoints, are they getting enough and 
equal representation in the media? Drawing on a unique dataset from 197 news articles related to COVID-19 
vaccines in Indonesia, the current study finds that there are a sufficient number of female authors but only 25% 
of sources being quoted were women. Subsequently, only one out of nine categories has more female than male 
sources. It raises concerns on how women's voices could be heard in a country where women make up for 50% 
of the population yet continue to be underrepresented in media coverage.

1. Introduction 
A bulk body of research suggests that the COVID-19 stories in various angles from its cause and impacts on 
human bodies (Kontis et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020), effects on mental health (Pfefferbaum and North, 2020), 
to impact education and economy (Daniel, 2020; McKee and Stuckler, 2020). Others have focused on how the 
global pandemic affects one of the most vulnerable groups today, women. Girls and women are traditionally given 
the role as caretaker in their family and society. They make up 67% of the global healthcare workers and have to 
take more responsibilities at home to care for their families during the pandemic (Boniol et al., 2019; Power, 
2020). The struggles of women do not stop there as studies have shown that more women than men are losing 
their jobs and face the threat of domestic violence from their husbands as the time spent at home increases 
significantly (Chang, 2020; Dias et al., 2020; Roesch et al., 2020). Their stress level is also overwhelming which 
may lead to death (Ifdil et al., 2020; Pradana et al., 2020). 
 
If women face such enormous challenges during this pandemic, how exactly are they being represented in the 
media? Do they get enough airtime in the media? Unfortunately, this topic remains understudied with very small 
exceptions.Smith (2020), for example, found that 93% of daily press briefings in the UK on COVID-19 are done 
by male politicians with only one female minister ever leading the brief. In first world countries, like the United 
States and Australia, quotations in news that are attributed to women make no more than 30%. Far worse, in 
developing countries such as India, Kenya, and Nigeria, only 20% quotations are given to females (Jones, 2020; 
Kossova, 2020). This shows just how poorly women are represented globally. A study by Prihatini and 
Halimatusa’diyah (2021) on how an Anglophone newspaper in Indonesia is reporting COVID-19 suggests that 
male sources continue to dominate news coverage. This composition is reflecting the political structure in which 
very few women are holding public offices such as parliament or local government (Prihatini, 2021). 
 
While nearly every existing study that the author could identify is done in non-Asian country and not a single of 
them is executed in a Southeast Asian country, this article aims to fill in this gap by observing women 
representation in the Indonesian media. This analysis is the first to provide empirical data of female distribution

2500","31 women elected as local leaders (Tribun News, 2018). This makes women's contribution sit at 6% from 508 
cities and districts. In the provincial level, only one governor is female out of 34 provinces which resulted in 
women’s share merely at 3% (CountryMeters,2021). The only province with a female leadership is East Java 
which is led by Khofifah Indar Parawansa, who is also a former minister and lawmaker (Ramadhan, 2019). 
Interestingly, she was never quoted despite the fact that her province is among those with highest positive cases 
(Rizky, 2021). Similarly, the top job in the country continues to be dominated by men since the independence in 
1945 as Megawati Soekarnoputri (2001-2004) is the only female president out of seven presidents. With these 
facts, the author asserts that women’s underrepresentation in the media is mirroring the political realm in 
Indonesia. This situation is not unique to Indonesia as it happens in at least 120 other countries. 
 
Among male leaders who have been massively quoted by the media are governors, vice governors, and regents in 
Java and Bali. Both islands are high populated areas in Indonesia with 151 million people hence it explains the 
massive quotations by the media (Sensus Penduduk, 2020). It is also worth noting that Jakarta, which is located 
in Java, is the capital city and business hub of the country where state civil apparatus mostly reside. Local leaders 
usually explain the vaccine distribution plans for their respective districts and cities such as Jakarta, Semarang, 
Solo, and Banyumas.  One of the examples is the Governor of Central Java, Ganjar Pranowo, who explained the 
priority groups of vaccination in an article published by Detik (4 January 2021) titled COVID-19 Vaccines have 
Arrived, on 14 January, Central Java Healthcare Workers will be Vaccinated.  
 
In comparison, male leaders have been massively quoted by the media. These men leaders are Anies Baswedan 
(Governor of Jakarta), Ganjar Pranowo (Governor of Central Java), Ridwan Kamil (Governor of West Java), 
Wayan Koster (Governor of Bali), Ahmad Riza Patria (Vice Governor of Jakarta), Andika Hazrumy (Vice 
Governor of Banten), Fadeli (Regent of Lamongan, East Java), and Sri Purnomo (Regent of Sleman, Special 
Region of Yogyakarta). These men mostly explain about the rollout progress in the areas they lead such as 
Pranowo in Kompas (5 January 2021), The data of the vaccine recipients from 35 districts/cities are available. 
The highest are in Semarang, Solo, and Banyumas. The average is above 10,000 doses''. With the same ability to 
lead, apparently Indonesian media still choose male leaders over women who are as meritful as these men in 
leading their regions. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper has demonstrated that women are still poorly represented in COVID-19 vaccines stories in the 
Indonesian media. There are two key takeaways from the current study. Firstly, there are more female journalists 
covering this topic, yet male sources are overrepresented when it comes to news quotations. From a total of 197 
news articles published by 26 media, more than half of journalists/authors are female. Secondly, news sources are 
massively attributed to men. From a total of 9 categories, only one category has more women being cited. 
Indonesian experience offers generalisability in terms of the condition in Southeast Asia and beyond. With the 
largest population in the region and the fourth in the world, women’s underrepresentation in Indonesian media 
will continue to shape how women’s fare in news coverage, especially during the current pandemic. The current 
study lends support to previous observations which suggest that women tend to be invisible in media reports 
regardless of countries’ socio and economic status.It supports previous studies that assert how women are barely 
visible in the media (Global Media Monitoring Project, 2020; Jones, 2020; Kossova, 2020; Smith, 2020).  
 
Improving women’s representation in the media is inseparable with the improvement of their substantive 
representation. Positions that currently are unfriendly toward women such as local/national leaders or ministers 
should admit more females. One of the approaches is through quota implementation. Furthermore, existing studies 
have suggested that gender stereotypes that exist in society limit women’s coverage to mostly feminine related 
topics (Van der Pas and Aaldering, 2020; Widiati, 2021). To tackle this, society must be educated that women’s 
roles are beyond being in the kitchen or as moms, but they can also be powerful leaders. There are two main 
caveats of this paper. First, as this paper collected its samples from Google News, hence it did not display the 
entire articles published during the period of the study. In this respect, some media may not appear in the search 
result as well. Therefore, future research might be interested in expanding the sampling method to other platforms 
beyond digital media and the period of observation. Doing it would allow more articles and media to be collected 
as data samples. Second, future study may also be interested in interviewing journalists to provide a qualitative 
perspective as to why authors choose to cover men or women sources in their articles. This could fill in the white 
spaces of this study that mainly focuses on a quantitative viewpoint in understanding gender bias in the media.  
 
Despite the mentioned limitations, one of the biggest contributions of this study is its attempt to fill in the white 
spaces in existing research. The current paper provides empirical evidence on how poorly women are represented 
in the media in a developing country, specifically in Southeast Asia. Previous studies have paid more focus to

1. Introduction 
Maintenance management is critical for guaranteeing continuous equipment performance improvement and ensuring 
quality operation while keeping the safety of the people and the environment. (Jiang, 2015). Maintenance for a 
repairable system aims to restore it as necessary, but primarily to enhance the system's reliability. (Rausand and 
Hoyland, 2004). As a result, a system's reliability analysis gives information about its failure process, assisting in the 
understanding of system operation and what to expect from its performance so that maintenance planning may be 
better adjusted. (Barringer, 2004). The need for the Maintenance function to keep up with the industrial system's 
continual changes and complexities necessitates that it should be well-structured and organized. (Guariente et al, 
2017). And with global competition increasing, the focus is now on optimizing asset effectiveness, avoiding failures, 
and maximizing gains (Santos et al, 2019). 
To reduce equipment failure or service degradation, Preventive Maintenance should be carried out which is indicated 
in the manufacturer’s instructions for use or technical documentation. (Iandanza, 2020). Therefore, planned 
maintenance includes works that will predict possible breakdowns to ensure higher equipment availability, thus, the 
tasks are needed to be done in advance. (Amaral FD, 2016).

4. Conclusions 
Conducting a system analysis using McKinsey’s 7s, internal analysis of the current system design, and decision 
analysis using the Kepner-Tregoe Approach helps the researcher to come up with a logical selection of the priority 
problem. In conducting a Why-Why Root Cause Analysis, the researcher has been able to address the problem 
accordingly. After all the analysis, the problem statement was finalized as The High Rate of Breakdown Maintenance 
was because there is no frequent Preventive Maintenance in the Standard Operating Procedure thus resulting in a 
loss in Production hours. Using a How-How diagram a rational frequency of weekly preventive maintenance was 
established, this triggers the new system design for the Maintenance Standard Operating Procedure. By using a 
Solution Planning and Implementation, this paper provides Maintenance Department with how to put the solution into 
action. In conducting a Potential Problem Analysis using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, the Maintenance 
Department will be able to prioritize which step they should be more focused on to improve process controls or re-
engineer the process step, shall there be any new issue arises.

Abstract 
 
Online shopping become one of the transaction methods for human beings to purchase products and services, 
especially since the pandemic of COVID-19. The goal of the study is to examine the relationship between 
functionality, delivery, and security towards satisfaction mediated by the online shopping experience at an e-
commerce marketplace platform. The research is a quantitative research approach and gathers data using an online 
survey. The survey data were collected using an electronic questionnaire on Microsoft Forms from 292 respondents 
who used e-commerce marketplace platforms. The structural equation method AMOS was utilized to evaluate the 
data. The results demonstrated as follows: the functionality and delivery variable have a significant effect on online 
shopping experiences; the online shopping experience variable as mediation has shown a significant effect on 
satisfaction, however, the security variable has no favorable effect on online shopping experience in e-commerce 
marketplace platform.

1. Introduction 
The global pandemic already changed heavily our daily activities and daily operations of business. Government 
implemented several strict restrictions and lockdown in order to minimize the transmission of the virus. Some 
countries experienced in and out the lockdowns for many times such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United 
Kingdom as the virus mutated in several variants’ of COVID-19 such as Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Some 
consequences of the lockdown were work-study from home, confinement at home, and morbidity psychosocial 
increased (Freeston, M. et al. 2020). As the social distancing restriction implemented in many public places, therefore 
the customers shifted from offline buying into online buying behavior as the safest way during the pandemic. Most of 
the customers make online shopping for products and service through e-commerce.

Abstract 
 
The consumption of Korean popular culture in Indonesia has always been increased since the early 2000s. In 
September 2021, the entire world was shocked by the South Korean entertainment industry with the appearance 
of the ""Squid Game"" Netflix mini series. South Korean language and culture is currently being globalized with the 
Korean wave, a term given when Korean pop culture has spread worldwide in various countries since the 1990s, 
such as films and music. The success of South Korean in exporting its culture can be immediately detected by the 
hike of interests in learning Korean. This study is particularly interested in examining the growing interest in 
learning Korean using online platforms, following a massive hit of the ""Squid Game"" in Indonesia. It also seeks 
to understand Indonesian young people's perceptions towards the Korean language.

1. Introduction 
Currently, with the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all face-to-face learning has turned to online learning. 
Digitization and the use of information and communication technology have changed all aspects of the educational 
process, bringing several benefits as well as disadvantages (Stefanovic and Klochkova 2021). The foreign language 
education environment has become more colorful, attractive and effective with the use of digital learning materials 
over the last few years (Karademir, Alper, Soğuksu, and Karababa 2021). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is 
forcing the world to turn to e-learning practices as attending classes physically is sometimes not possible, and 
digital education allows one to study anytime and anywhere (Kosareva, Demidov, Ikonnikova, and Shalamovа 
2019), a shift from traditional learning to e-learning approaches, more or less already proven by some study. On 
the one hand, it contributes to overcoming the existing difficulties, but on the other hand, it will be interesting to 
evaluate the effects and final results in the years to come (Stefanovic and Klochkova 2021). In addition, e-learning 
can improve foreign language skills in reading, listening, speaking, and writing. The use of e-learning is a new 
learning process that can provide new experiences (Ying, Mulyadan, and Lim 2021). 
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone can learn a language anywhere, anytime, and through anything cheaply 
and even for free. Many digital platforms to learn such as Duolingo, Cakap, Lingotalk and many more. For example 
Duolingo which is an online language learning platform launched in 2012 that offers courses in 27 different world 
languages (Teske 2017). Although Duolingo can be accessed by any web-enabled device via the internet at 
https://www. duolingo.com/, the greatest affordability is mobile access worldwide. Learner progress across 
multiple platforms can be synced across devices. The program also includes features for interacting with both the 
program and other language learners (Loewen, Crowther, Isbell, Maloney, Miller, Rawal and Kim 2019). 
However, apart from Duolingo, there is a language education platform called Cakap by squline which is the pioneer 
of online education in Indonesia since 2014 by Tomy Yunus. Cakap by squline is a company adopting a two-way 
interaction platform by facilitating language learning for non-native speakers either by providing pre-developed 
content or by connecting learners with native speakers. The Cakap platform caters to learners of all ages, whether 
they are in school or adults looking to develop new language skills (World Bank Group 2020). And in 2019 Cakap 
already has more than 100,000 users (Marsyaf 2018). 
 
In the late 1990s, South Korea became a new center for transnational popular culture production (Sari and Jamaan 
2014), distributing its media products to many Asian countries such as Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Singapore. At that time it was the Chinese media who popularized the ""Korean Wave"" or ""Hallyu"" which is the 
term for the spread of Korean popular culture abroad (Hae-Joang 2005) and also describes the love of Korean 
cultural products by young Chinese. Initially only distributing Korean TV dramas, now there are various kinds of

2531","“..there are limitations in exploring the apps with paid features, sometimes the vocabulary is not for daily 
conversation, so I really don't know who should be our partner in the exercise (older person, parents, 
peers, etc.)” (R3) 
 
“There are times when the task becomes neglected because I forgot to use the platform because there is 
no reminder” (R6) 
The purpose of the study was to identify the effects of the successful ""Squid Game"" series on the use of online 
learning platforms and young people's perceptions of the Korean language. The results showed that the atmosphere 
of the COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the desire to learn languages, especially Korean, but it did not become 
an obstacle for second language learners, instead it became an encouragement for them to be even more 
enthusiastic and many of them used online media platforms as a tool to hone their language skills. they. Even so, 
the use of online platforms still has its advantages and disadvantages, such as flexibility, efficiency, and even an 
attractive layout that creates its own advantages. However, online platforms have drawbacks such as limited use 
of applications with paid features and unstable internet connections. Further studies are needed to examine how 
and why the interest in learning Korean using online platforms can change, especially when the pandemic ends.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Our study has shown that after watching the “Squid Game” series and the current pandemic, most respondents 
continue to learn foreign languages, especially Korean. In fact, the limitation of face-to-face learning could actually 
encourage learners to use online platforms because this approach offers flexibility and can be accessed at any time. 
This paper reveals the interests of our respondents in learning Korean through online platforms after watching the 
“Squid Game” Netflix mini series and during the pandemic using online surveys and interviews. The findings 
show that most of the respondents in this study are very interested in learning Korean after watching the “Squid 
Game” series and their main motivation is because they are very interested in Korean cultural products such as K-
pop, Korean films, and TV programs and also they want to broaden their insight about Korea. This paper 
contributes to the literature on Korean foreign languages and the use of online platforms to study Korean. Some 
caveats from this study include the number of respondents and the duration of the observation. While the interest 
in learning Korean can be triggered by the “Squid Game”, more study is needed to examine whether this is 
sustainable in a longer run. It is also interesting to test whether the new skill will provide a better job opportunity 
for young Indonesians.

Abstract 
The success of an organization is measured by accomplished project deliverables and growth in market competition. 
However, hindrances can be an impediment in project successes. These hindrances are mostly attributed to project delays. 
This study aims to outline project delays in construction projects, particularly in elevator constructions. Furthermore, the 
paper addresses the issue of these delays and proposes a process performance improvement through the identification and 
mitigation of delays in elevator construction – by presentation of project research criteria and identification of appropriate 
project management tools and techniques. To achieve this goal, a multi-mode descriptive  study is adapted by using 
quantitative and qualitative approaches by means of interviews, root-cause analysis, decision analyses, and potential 
problem analysis. Based on the analyses conducted, risk assessment, supply chain forecasting, Critical Path Method (CPM), 
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), Make to Stock (MTS), and schedule compression are necessary to 
avoid the three most significant delays: lack of project management tools, poor risk management plan, and delay in delivery 
of materials by supplier, respectively.

Based on Table 11, the highest risk priority number obtained is the setting of accurate deadline. Given the aforementioned 
challenges, authorized individuals in the business should validate the client's needs and implement the technique of 
documenting, prioritizing, and agreeing on the project scope by both sides in order to generate and set an attainable 
deadline. The team must also make use of scheduling software and tools.

5. Conclusion 
Proactive approach for process improvement is utilized for the prevention of issues that may occur before the project begins 
- through the application of Decision Analyses in the identification of delay factors and implementation of controls on 
project management. To avoid having delays, the company must focus on the duration of project activities and control the 
crucial risks that may occur during project development. The study recommends that there is a need to improve in project 
planning in the current processes of the company; and adaptation and investing in project management tools and software 
is necessary. Furthermore, the application of weighted scoring in project development can contribute greatly for the 
prioritization of actions - by means of ranking delays in order to gain adequate insight on risk assessment for project 
completion. Finally, the study implores that the benefits of integration of PM software outweighs the costs of such tools.

Abstract  
 
A time study project is conducted to analyze the effects of a canning factory's production floor designs. Several factors 
are considered in this study, including production times, safety, and financial aspects. Four team members observed 
the process of conducting the time study using the ""Stopwatch Method"" and the ""Real-Time Camera."" Both methods 
were used independently to ensure higher accuracy. The original floor plan was used to calculate the production times 
while considering the losses from machine downtime. Then, the times are compared to a newly designed floor plan. 
With the stopwatch, the team collected data times implemented into the mathematical equations to determine digital 
evidence without peripheral distractions. After the mathematic calculations were completed, the team moved to the 
video of the entire process during an actual production time during 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shifts.  The video showed the 
amount of time wasted when employees and maintenance. It is also seen several risks of losing workers due to forklift 
traffic. The team brainstormed a new floor plan to be implemented. After calculating and comparing the two 
floorplans, the new floor plan indicated that rerouting the walkway allowed for less downtime, a shorter distance 
between work areas, and a higher level of safety and production. The new design would enable machine operators to 
move faster between locations and reduce the number of cans lost.

Abstract  
 
The advances in technology in the recent decade have led to the introduction of a new term called 
Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution, which has led to the emergence of the term lead to 
Quality 4.0. Quality 4.0 is the digitalization of traditional quality approaches and focuses on digital 
tools used to improve an organization's ability to meet customer requirements with high quality. 
The application of Quality 4.0 practices in higher education institutions (HEIs) has the potential 
of driving innovation through technological advances in various aspects. Therefore, the digital 
transformation would be leading to transformation in education to achieve a comprehensive set of 
practical and significant goals through the formulation and execution of quality initiatives 
supported by Industry 4.0 related technologies. The research aims to develop a framework to assess 
the maturity level of HEIs towards transformation to Quality 4.0 while considering the impact of 
such transformation on the process, people, and technology dimensions defined in the Quality 4.0 
model proposed by the LNS Research. Around 93 practices were categorized into 11 Quality 4.0 
axes to form a survey that determines the current level of HEIs transformation efforts and find out 
their strengths and weaknesses and locate them at one of the five defined maturity levels 
accordingly. The proposed framework has been validated by determining the maturity level of 
Quality 4.0 implementation within Saudi HEIs. The result showed that all 26 Saudi HEIs obtained 
scores in the second, third, fourth, and fifth levels, indicating that all HEIs are above the first level 
(initial quality). This finding indicates that some HEIs have a basic understanding of digital 
transformation and are familiar with some processes but are unfamiliar with new technologies, 
while others are at the most advanced level of Quality 4.0 adoption.

Abstract  
 
To investigate customer behavior on an e-commerce platform in Thailand that was expanding in response to the 
increasing value of a market in which more people purchase online. Furthermore, e-commerce is an advertising 
medium since it instantly connects information or user needs to target customers while also responding to market 
demands by reducing the time it takes to bring products to market, allowing for rapid market expansion. The study 
aims to study consumer behavior in online shopping through an application or platform and analyze the critical aspects 
of online shopping of customer behavior in e-commerce. Data were collected and processed using exploratory factor 
analysis (EFA) techniques, and a sample of 400 general people was chosen for survey research using questionnaires. 
The study's findings were as follows: Reliability testing; KMO and Bartlett's tests; total variance explained; Scree 
plot; rotated component matrix. The result of the EFA analysis came down to two components from 21 variables. As 
a result, they have been extremely positive and have garnered the most attention.

1. Introduction  
E-commerce in Thailand is growing at an unprecedented pace with the increasing value of a market where more 
consumers shop online than in-store. Especially the emergence of new technologies that change the presentation as 
well. E-commerce is running a business using electronic, text, audio, image, or video clips.  E-commerce operators 
must pay the same tax as other operators.  Same as with other online services, income tax and value-added tax (VAT) 
are payable over the internet.  Financial transactions and capital are considered e-commerce.  These business 
transactions can be done in four different ways: business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-
to-consumer (C2C), consumer-to-business (C2B), and e-commerce standards.  It is a commercial transaction made 
via the Internet.  Online stores like Amazon, Flipkart, and Shopify. 
 
Electronic commerce, commonly known as ‘E-Commerce’, refers to the model that allows both businesses and 
consumers to acquire or trade either goods or services through an electronic network or the internet. As well as the 
transmission of funds or data. E-commerce can be conducted through various devices such as computers or 
smartphones. These transactions can either be business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-
to-consumer (C2C), or consumer-to-business (C2B). These terms are usually used interchangeably. E-tailing or 
electronic retailing can sometimes be referenced to any transaction process that constructs online retail shopping.  
 
In Thailand, there are 3 main platforms of  E-commerce, which are Shopee, Lazada and J&D central. All platforms 
use a hybrid of C2C and B2C as their e-commerce transactions and model. C2C business is a business model that 
proceeds with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy. The C2C model capacitates customers to trade with 
each other, usually in an online environment. B2C is where a company that sells products or services directly to the

2554","6. Conclusion  
For this study, most consumers choose to shop online because it is more convenient and they can buy goods and 
services anywhere, anytime. Most of them choose to use Shopee because of the diversity of the products, which was 
counted as 53.7 percent from 400 responses and the major thing that most of them consider purchasing is the price 
which is 66.6 percent. We chose to study consumers in Thailand that use the Shopee application through a 
questionnaire form and using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) tools to analyze the data and results using the SPSS 
program. The results analysis showed from 21 questions that Cronbach's Alpha is an excellent level of reliability. To 
determine sampling adequacy, the KMO test is employed. With said results, we can see that consumers use online 
shopping because of the convenience and the diversity of goods or services on the application by concentrating on the 
price. 
 
Most customers in Thailand are concerned about the price of the product, they will choose the product from an 
application that has the lowest price. When they had experience with that application, they will have a perception 
about that application is the cheapest. The customer has the perception that the Shopee application sells the product 
lower than another application, the customer will re-purchase the product from the Shopee application again. The 
seller of the application owner should concern with the price of the product. If the seller can sell the product at a lower 
price, then customers will come back and re-purchase. The application also has a chance to sell another product.

1. Introduction  
Technology enables innovation in many sectors, especially in financial technology services or Financial Technology 
is growing rapidly. One form of technology service that is being developed is Internet Banking (IB). This is because 
banking services are currently required to be more flexible, fast, and easy in line with technological developments in 
the era of globalization. Internet Banking is becoming the most profitable among other e-commerce applications. All 
banks have introduced Internet Banking to improve services and reduce costs. In addition, IB will not only benefit the 
bank but will also meet the needs of customers. Banking technology adjustments must at least offer services that 
support customer or user activities and can be accessed easily. For this reason, customers are recommended to use 
internet services because they do not need to physically meet face-to-face with bank officers and do not need to deal 
with other customers. This is to reduce inconvenience, transaction costs, and time. 
 
With regard to minimizing physical contact between customers or users, the world is also being hit by the Covid-19 
pandemic, which requires reducing and limiting human activities that require direct or physical contact to prevent 
transmission of the virus. This has prompted governments in various countries to make several policies, one of which 
is physical distancing. This policy was also called by the World Health Organization (WHO) which advised banking 
customers to make transactions online. Governments in more and more countries are taking action to encourage 
contactless or physical payments. This is because many people are worried about the spread of the Covid-19 virus 
through physical money. Physical money can be a medium for transmitting the virus when it is touched by an infected 
person. Therefore, WHO recommends processing payments using digital money whenever possible. Prior to this 
pandemic, cashless or physical payments via smartphones were already known to many people in developing countries 
such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In Indonesia, there has been an appeal to make digital payments submitted 
by the Governor of Bank Indonesia, especially in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic to prevent transmission. Based on 
the background that has been described, the authors are interested in conducting research with the title ""Factors 
Influencing Bandung Students Using Internet Banking as a Non-Cash Payment Tool in the Covid-19 Pandemic Era 
(Case Study of the Livin Application by Bank Mandiri"".

Abstract 
In this research work, a problem related to the most expensive cut that is purchase (Tenderloin) by food service 
operations company has been analyzed. The monthly relevant data such related to fixed and variable costs was 
collected. The monthly demand and average selling price of Tenderloin observed. The breakeven point, Sensitive 
analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were done. The risk associated with the loss (22%) has been observed and 
recommendations were given to enhance the price.

1. Introduction
The aim of this project is to conduct several what-if analyses, Most empirical studies indicate that farmers are risk 
neutral to slightly risk averse. It is doubtful whether decision makers could be classified according to their risk 
preferences. Proposed topics for agricultural risk research include the need for a strategic change and the effectiveness 
of decision support for different decision problems (Gul & Pesendorfer, 2008) in order to help a food service operation 
company in Saudi Arabia to plan for their procurement (Sen, 1998). By understanding the different possible scenarios 
and what could happen as a result for each of them, the management of the company could make a well-thought and 
sound decision, the integration of life-cycle assessment methods with a new input‐output model of the world economy 
to analyze the environmental and economic implications of alternative future diets. It reviews findings by industrial 
ecologists about the energy and land required for the production and consumption of alternative foods and diets. 
 (Duchin, 2005). The decision directly impacts the bottom-line of the company, as it will increase the revenues 
obtained (Liu & Lu, 2015). Three different analyses were conducted: 
-
Breakeven analysis
-
Sensitivity analysis
-
Monte Carlo Simulation
1.1.  Objectives 
The objective of this work is to help the management of the company determine whether or not to order a certain cut 
from a supplier to satisfy the monthly demand of the customers. 
2. Methodology
To begin, we needed to understand the business side of the problem. We sat down with the Operations manager, and 
the Supply Chain Executive to understand how the process of purchasing work. We then agreed to tackle a single 
problem which is related to the most expensive cut they purchase (Tenderloin). Furthermore, we obtained all the

relevant data such as all cost items whether it was Fixed Costs or Variable Costs. After that, we looked into the monthly","Figure 4. Expected Standard deviation and First Simulation 
Then we ran the model for 500 other simulations, and figure 5 are the results for just the first 20 of them. Finally, we 
calculated basic statistics to help aid the decision making, in which we found out that 22% of the times ordering will 
not be profitable for the company (will yield loss instead of profit). 
Figure 5. Basic statistics to help aid the decision making 
4. Conclusions and Future Research 
As per the above analysis, we recommend that the company make the order, as it will yield profit from it. However, 
it should try to increase the price if possible, and if not then increasing the demand will also increase their net profit. 
The risk associated with loss in this is only 22% which is moderate, but this is a decision for the managers to make. 
One way to improve and carry on this work is to conduct the same analysis for the full range of products (portfolio of 
products). The analyses conducted throughout this work has been very insightful to the directors at the food service 
operation company. Their decision before to order was not informed by data and powerful statistical insights, therefore 
in the past they have been barely profitable. Such analysis is expected to enhance their profitability in the near future. 
Alternative way is recommending to the company to change the way they do business by utilizing sea freight shipping 
for bigger quantities instead of air freight. Also, negotiations with the suppliers for better prices, as well as reducing 
the storage and delivery costs of their operations in Saudi Arabia.

Abstract 
 
Due to the worldwide epidemiological crisis, the biomedical engineering sector, as part of the Egyptian Public Health 
Administration, has become under intense pressure to play a vital role in delivering appropriate healthcare services in 
the country and improving its performance. Most medical equipment maintenance centers in the country have 
struggled to provide functional medical equipment in the public healthcare sector while keeping up with huge repair 
orders to meet the growing needs of medical devices to provide quality services at affordable cost. Hence, there is a 
great need to deploy continuous improvement and waste elimination methodologies such as lean six sigma (LSS) in 
the biomedical engineering sectors to enhance the process capability to return repaired equipment to the field promptly. 
The purpose of this article is to present a case study on the application of Lean Six Sigma methodology at a medical 
devices repair center in Egypt. A comprehensive analysis of the entire process has been carried out to reduce the lead 
time of the repair by improving the entire process. The results indicate that lean six sigma can be applied effectively 
to improve the availability of functional medical devices in public hospitals in Egypt.

4. Conclusions  
This paper demonstrated how LSS was successfully utilized in Egypt's public health system to reduce the repair time 
of medical devices. LSS is a long-term method and despite being time-consuming, it guarantees a proper problem-
solving approach for the maintenance process. A large data collection sheet was created to collect all the measured 
data for 80 medical devices to assess the current state of the repair process. Results from FMEA indicated that the 
process of finishing paperwork for functional devices has the highest RPN. The implemented solution was 
transforming conventional methods related to the paperwork of all sub-processes in the repair center into a web-based 
system. Furthermore, the follow-up processes transformed into electronic-based methods. Consequently, the step of 
finishing paperwork, which has the largest influence on delaying the entire repair process was eliminated.  This work 
showed the power of integrating the PDCA cycle with LSS throughout the control phase ensuring continuous 
improvement.

1. Introduction 
The world’s limited resources have to be shared by a population that keeps growing. The Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) said that by 2050, there will be 9 billion people on Earth, and the number of people who need 
food will grow by 70% (Pivoto et al., 2018). But there isn’t much land that can be used for farming, and climate 
change threatens crop yields. It is very important to deal with these dangers. In fact, one of the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) (Opoku, 2019) in the UN 2030 Agenda is to get to sustainable food production systems 
through farming methods that increase productivity and adapt to climate change (J. & N., 2018). We used bibliometrics 
tools to describe the boundaries and dynamics of the IoT Based Agriculture research field. Quantitative analysis 
(Hosseini et al., 2019) and statistics are applied to published publications by bibliometrics in order to gauge their 
influence. The qualitative technique of a structured literature review and the quantitative approach of meta-analysis

Abstract  
 
This research aims to see how government policies regarding the standardization of tin with Sn 99.9% content affect 
the condition of Indonesian tin and its impact on the global tin market. This research uses the concept of a global 
production network. This research focuses on strategy and dynamics in the tin industry. This research uses secondary 
data obtained from news, reports, and previous research that discusses the Indonesian tin industry and primary data 
obtained through interviews with relevant parties that influence policy formation, then analyzed using the explanatory 
method. This research shows that the policy of Sn 99.9% content in tin affects the condition of Indonesian tin. The 
main reason for establishing this policy is to protect the availability of tin raw materials. The price of tin with a Sn 
99.9% higher content makes for superior profits. The impact of standardization of tin content tends to be positive 
because Indonesia can directly sell tin without reprocessing it. On the other hand, the entry of tin products with a 
content of Sn 99.9% into the global tin market has increased the availability of tin supply. This condition certainly 
makes customers no longer dependent on one supplier. Customers in the global market can also buy directly from 
Indonesia. However, in some situations, other factors affect the state of the tin market.

1. Introduction  
The covid-19 virus spread since early 2020 has changed human behavior and habits quite a lot. This condition certainly 
impacted the declining economic conditions in the first quarter of 2020, but these conditions gradually recovered 
(TIMAH 2020). One industry that has seen its development is the electronics industry, which is increasing because 
people need additional electronic goods during the social distancing period at home (Elisabeth 2021). Tin is one of 
the industries that has risen because tin is the raw material needed for producing electronic goods. As one of the global 
tin suppliers, Indonesia certainly has a significant role in meeting this demand. As is known, Indonesia currently 
occupies the second position as the largest tin-producing country in the world after China (ICDX 2021). According to 
data obtained from the Indonesia Commodity & Derivatives Exchange, the domestic industry only uses five percent 
of the total production of 70 to 80 thousand metric tons annually. This data reveals that most of Indonesia's tin 
production is distributed overseas (Ibrahim et al. 2018). On the other hand, since 2015, China has had a policy of using 
their tin production to support the production of several other domestic industries (Irzon 2021).  
 
This policy forced China to limit its tin exports to the global market. The Chinese government set this policy because 
China has many companies that are advanced enough to produce various products that require tin as a component. 
This condition forced China to limit their tin exports to the global market, which also affected the supply chain because 
previously, China was the largest tin producer and supplier in the global market. However, the amount of tin 
production from Indonesia, the second-largest tin producer after China, can also meet the demand that comes from the 
global market. This condition illustrates that even though China has limited the number of their exports, the 
sustainability of the global tin supply chain is still running and available because there are other producers in the 
market. These factors prove Indonesia's current position as the largest tin supplier globally. The picture below is top 
10 refined tin producers.

From a strategic perspective, we can see that the government's primary objective in setting a standard policy of Sn 
99.9% content in tin exports is to protect the natural resources still available in Indonesia. This strategy certainly 
contributes to the sustainability of the tin supply chain in the global market. The government's strategy to protect the 
availability of tin resources is the best step to reduce illegal activities, which further reduce the number of available 
tin resources that will later be produced. Indonesia's position as one of the global tin producers and suppliers has an 
essential role in the global tin supply chain. To maintain the condition of the supply chain sustainability of tin in the 
global market, of course, the government must continue to strive to protect the availability of tin resources that can be 
produced later. However, another thing that is also why the government set this policy is to get a more significant 
profit. Previously, Indonesia only exported tin ore produced by other parties to become refined tin with an Sn content 
of 99.9%. The government assesses that producing tin up to Sn 99.9% will increase Indonesia's profits. This is because 
the selling price of refined tin tends to be more expensive than tin ore. The strategy regarding the standard policy of 
Sn 99.9% content in tin implemented by the government also has a considerable impact on customers in the global 
market. They can directly buy refined tin from Indonesia to be directly used as a component of the production of other 
goods. As previously known, China is the primary producer of refined tin in the global market. 
 
In the future, Indonesia and China are still being important actors in the supply chain sustainability of tin in the global 
market. This relates to the Competent Person tasked with investigating and reporting on the origin of tin, resource 
estimation, reserve estimation, and exploration results. Through this report, it can be seen how significant the estimated 
reserves of tin resources are. The report results explain that Indonesia will still be one of the actors who play an 
essential role in the global tin supply chain in the next few years, and China, which also fulfills domestic demand. It 
can be said that the Indonesian government's policy regarding the standard content of Sn 99.9% contained in tin has a 
significant impact on the global market, especially on the supply chain sustainability of tin in the global market. 
Through this policy, the government can secure the availability of tin resources that can be processed for the future. 
Moreover, as previously mentioned, Indonesia has an essential role in the global tin supply chain. If the government 
does not take firm action against these illegal activities, it will further deplete the availability of tin resources, and 
perhaps the amount will run out faster. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Indonesia's position as one of the largest tin-producing countries globally certainly has an essential role in the world's 
tin supply chain. This is illustrated by the government's attention to the tin industry since 1967. To protect the 
availability of tin resources in Indonesia, the government has set a policy to standardize the Sn 99.9% content in the 
tin as an export requirement. This policy can be said to be the central policy on tin export permits and affects the 
condition of the Indonesian tin industry. As one of the largest producers and significant suppliers of tin globally, this 
condition then affects the global tin market. This can be seen from the decline in the price of refined tin after Indonesia 
officially implemented a standard policy of Sn 99.9% content. The increased supply of refined tin due to supply from 
Indonesia makes prices tend to fall because the number of customers also does not increase. However, from the 
Proceedings of the 7th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering 
and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022

2611","perspective of customers in the global market, this policy is favorable because they can directly buy refined tin from 
Indonesia to use as a component in producing other goods. Other conditions were also seen in 2019. The reduced 
supply of refined tin from Indonesia made the price of refined tin tend to increase from the previous few years. 
 
In terms of the main reason for establishing a standard policy of Sn 99.9% content in tin, we can also see that the 
supply chain sustainability of tin must be considered. The number of products that require tin as one of their 
components proves that tin is a commodity that is quite important in various industries. The illegal activities that 
previously took place were very detrimental because they further reduced the availability of tin resources that could 
be produced. Through this policy, the government can monitor and maintain the availability of tin resources for the 
supply chain sustainability of tin in the global market. Based on the concept of GPN, we can see that the government's 
policy regarding the content of Sn 99.9%  in tin has quite affected the dynamics of the global tin market. On the other 
hand, the government's strategy to adopt this policy impacts global tin market conditions. The dynamics of the tin 
industry policy in Indonesia will continue, and the government will, of course, continue to adjust the policy to current 
conditions. The challenge is how Indonesia's strategy, especially tin producing companies, is to continue to produce 
and meet global tin demand.

Abstract 
 
Contact tracing is one of the effective mediums in containing the virus brought about by the coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19). In the Philippines, Valenzuela City is known for pioneering the digital contact tracing system known as 
Project X. Despite implementing this system, users of Project X encounter challenges in Accessibility, Registration, 
and Scanning. Moreover, the repetitive and prolonged time of filling out Health Declaration Forms causes 
inconvenience. This study aims to redesign Project X into an inclusive digital contact tracing system with a unified 
system for citizens’ contact identification and health declaration. The research will be significant to Filipino citizens 
using digital contact tracing, contact tracers, the Local Government Units (LGUs), government agencies, and the 
future researchers who will be carrying out similar fields of studies. The researchers collected data through online 
interviews and survey questionnaires for the Analytical Hierarchy Process, Concept Scoring, and Usability Test. 
Alternative solutions such as RFID, Face ID, and Kiosk, and three design models were developed: RFID Card, RFID 
Keychain, and RFID Bracelet. Three design models were presented to the respondents for scoring and testing to get 
the best solution. Upon testing, the proponents received user feedback and recommendations for improvement.

1. Introduction 
Contact tracing has been one of the primary responses to mitigate the COVID-19. The LGUs from different cities 
implemented ways to determine the contacts, one of which is through the use of technology. The Valenzuela City 
adapted a Quick-Response (QR) scanning per establishment to trace individuals. Through the use of QR codes, citizens 
can give their personal information such as name, gender, birthday, and address to the establishment and LGU directly. 
 
Despite implementing this system, it is still a challenge for the users in the Philippines to adapt to the digital contact 
tracing system. If applying the digital contact tracing system with the general population is a challenge, it must be 
more difficult for those with visual impairment. With this, contact tracing must be accessible to all, including those 
with visual impairments (Chan et al., 2021). 
 
Applying the Design Thinking Approach, the users’ pain points focus on the following: Accessing, Registering, and 
Scanning (Chan et al., 2021). For accessibility, problems arise such as lack of internet connection, difficulty navigating 
website address, difficulty accessing the QR codes, and non-tech-savviness. For registering, difficulty in reading

2614","5.3 Validation 
From the results of the Process part, 98% of respondents agreed that there are no delays in detecting RFID Keychain, 
100% agreed that they are no delays in detecting their temperature, 100% find the process easy and fast, and 98% see 
the symbols helpful in navigating the scanner, and 100% can clearly read the text on display. In the RFID keychain’s 
design, 100% found the RFID keychain easy to use, 100% found the device more convenient when entering premises, 
95% found the device durable, and 100% found it handy and easy to carry. Overall, 98% of the respondents are 
satisfied with the simplicity and ease of the process. 100% also find the device user-friendly, 100% feel that the process 
should be implemented in all establishments, and 95% think PWDs can use the system. 
 
 
Figure 5. User Satisfaction Rate Chart 
 
From Figure 5 above, although the users have different perspectives on the proposed system, they all agree that they 
are satisfied with the system. From the gathered responses from the 40 users, we can conclude that the prototype is 
successful in aiding a better contact tracing process. It also reduces the processing time it takes the users to declare 
information regarding tracing. 
  
6. Conclusion 
In the second phase of the study (Product-focus), the researchers came up with three designs for a more efficient digital 
contact tracing system that encompasses the users’ pain points: RFID, Face ID, and Kiosk. In determining the optimal 
solution among the three, four criteria were considered: Cost-Efficiency, Accessibility, Ease of Use, and Availability 
of Resources. Subjected to their respective priority weights, Multi-Criteria Decision Making, specifically Analytical 
Hierarchy Process, was performed wherein RFID is the most preferred design. Concept Screening and Scoring were 
then executed to verify the results of the AHP with RFID as the proposed concept and Current Project X as the 
reference. The researchers designed three RFID models: card, keychain, and bracelet, with the keychain being the 
preferred design. Through Arduino UNO, the researchers devised a prototype for the users to test. The Usability 
Questionnaire shows that 100% of the 40 users are satisfied with the overall proposed Project X. These 40 users were 
able to suggest improvements and feedback on the prototype, such as the casing must be improved along with the 
connection of wires and how the devices were attached. There were also suggested improvements regarding the 
material used, such as the tape and the placement of the widgets in the casing. It was also recommended that the 
proposed system would not only be implemented in Valenzuela but also in other parts of the Philippines. With the 
inclusive designs taken into consideration, the Braille feature would require a braille printer device which will be used 
for mass production. Given this information, the project’s proponents shall integrate the Braille feature when the 
system is implemented.  
 
This study covered the objectives stated, such as proposing alternative solutions to the current Valenzuela’s digital 
contact tracing system, devising a working prototype, testing this prototype with real users of current Project X, and 
suggesting improvements for further study.

Abstract 
 
The spread of the corona virus, also known as COVID-19, has had a significant impact on the current situation of the 
economy, politics, services, and welfare. COVID-19 is spreading on a global basis, which means the virus is affecting 
people all over the world. Because of the pandemic, there is a lot of free time in the community, which allows people 
to enjoy more time by communicating on social media. A quantitative technique is used in this research. Quantitative 
research is a type of investigation that uses natural science approaches to generate numerical data and hard facts. 
Consumers and sellers of streetwear clothing in Indonesia are the focus of this study. The Partial Least Squares method 
is used in this research (PLS). SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) is one of the strategies now being utilized to 
compensate for the shortcomings of regression methods. All indications have been considered legitimate based on the 
study that has been done. Discriminant legitimacy test can be estimated utilizing cross stacking and its builds. The 
cross stacking basis is that every marker that actions a variable should have a higher connection than the others. that 
the markers utilized in the review have great discriminant legitimacy. In light of the consequences of information 
investigation, it is expressed that the four factors, have a more prominent AVE esteem so they have met the legitimacy 
necessities. From the external stacking test information, it shows that all markers are legitimate and appropriate for 
research and can be utilized for additional investigation

Introduction 
The current state of the economy, politics, services, and welfare has been greatly affected by the spread of the corona 
virus or what is known as COVID-19. The spread of COVID-19 has a global scale, which means that the whole world 
is affected by the virus. De vos (2020) states that large-scale lockdowns are in place around the world to prevent the 
spread of the virus. Indonesia is a country that is one of many countries with a large number of COVID-19 outbreaks, 
various methods have been carried out by the Indonesian government and directions from the United Nations, but it 
is possible that this virus will disappear, such as implementing PSBB. PSBB is a restriction on certain activities of 
residents in an area suspected of being infected with the corona virus to prevent the possibility of spreading further 
(kompas.com). at the beginning this virus began to spread and then locked down in various areas that contained red 
zones in the area, until finally carrying out PPKM levels 1-4 according to areas where the virus spread a lot or a little. 
PPKM is an abbreviation of Enforcement of Community Activity Restrictions. This PPKM is carried out to limit 
interactions, meetings between people and people and groups with groups, which is expected to reduce the 
transmission of COVID-19 (finance.detik.com). The effect of the efforts made by the government has resulted in 
several things, such as WFH (work from home), namely activities carried out generally in the office or school, being 
moved at home according to their respective rules, gathering time with one's family, doing shopping activities for 
daily needs and personal needs through online such as using a marketplace application for shopping for household 
needs and using social media for personal needs, namely buying clothes and pants. Tarhini et al. (2021) stated that 
shopping through online channels is actively developing because of the opportunity to save time and effort. With this 
pandemic, there is a lot of free time in the community so that it makes people enjoy more time by using social media

such as clothing brands because people are not allowed to go to crowded places during this pandemic. Then came the 
idea of all business actors to provide convenience and satisfaction for people in shopping for their products. Chiguvi

1. Introduction 
In the current era of globalization Indonesia has experienced some very rapid economic and technological 
development. Information technology is a very important need. Even as an urgent demand for everyone to solve 
a problem quickly and relieve all work. Along with this situation, the development of information technology, 
especially the role of computers, is getting very serious attention. This information technology has a tremendous 
impact in today's banking world. Lately there have also been many changes in information technology, as well as 
in the field of telecommunications which is mostly due to the urgency and enormity of competition in the banking 
world. This development is getting faster and faster. The number of internet users in Indonesia certainly cannot 
be denied also encourages the business world to be more advanced and develop. The Internet becomes a medium 
in making sales and purchase transactions. In addition, the internet becomes a medium for finding information 
and exchanging information. 
 
People are so enthusiastic about using the internet. This indicates that technology is a core part of the development 
of business strategy. Therefore, currently the banking industry is increasingly aggressive in creating systems that 
combine information technology with Financial, one of which is Mobile Banking. 
 
Mobile Banking is a banking service that implements information technology and is a form of service products 
that began to be widely offered by banks in Indonesia. This service becomes an opportunity for banks to offer 
added value to customers. 
 
According to the CNBC Research Team search, before there was Mobile Banking and Internet Banking, to transfer 
money alone need to go to a branch office or ATM. But with the development of information technology that is 
increasingly sophisticated becomes a need to support business developments in the banking sector. This reason is 
one of the causes of the bank determining the offer of M-banking services.  
 
The use of m-banking is very beneficial for customers as an example of the benefits of m-banking livin by Mandiri 
can be used for interbank transfer transactions, balance information, multipayment that can be used to pay for 
something done online such as online shopping, paying for electricity, water and much more. In other words, 
mobile banking is the distribution of banks to access those owned by customers with mobile phone facilities to be

Abstract 
 
Online shopping platforms or e-commerce is rife in Indonesia, various e-commerce also compete with each other 
to get customers even more so in the current state of pandemic, online shopping is clearly the most widely chosen 
alternative by customers, but because of the many options or options for customers to shop, then e-commerce 
companies also install various strategies to get customers' hearts,  In this case, it is clear that customer loyalty is 
expected by the company, but how can customers be loyal to our company. In the following research discuss how 
satisfaction affects customer loyalty and also the things that affect customer satisfaction.

1.Introduction 
The development of e-commerce in Indonesia is currently very fast, this is triggered by the development of 
technology, especially in the field of internet technology. Only through smartphones and PCs can we interact with 
others indefinitely and distance, as if we do it directly. So, with this ease technology makes it possible to open 
business opportunities. Technology can be sales mediation to market a product or as a means to promote a product 
online, for example through e-commerce or social media such as facebook, instagram, tiktok, etc. What's more, 
with the current covid-19 pandemic conditions, we are forced to limit all direct interactions. This is very difficult 
for us which greatly impacts all social and economic aspects.  Then technology is one solution to help in the 
current situation, both in communicating, shopping, etc. 
 
E-commerce or online stores are familiar to our ears, according to Tutik Mustajibah and Agus Trilaksana (2021) 
The rapid development of e-commerce is the impact of people who began to know the internet widely the growth 
of e-commerce itself in Indonesia is characterized by the emergence of startups such as Toko Bagus in 2005, 
Bukalapak and other marketplace sites between 2007 and the peak of marketplace competition.  2015.  This is 
what causes the sales system to evolve from a conventional to digital system, thus providing convenience and 
effectiveness for manufacturers and consumers struggling in the field of sales / e-commerce. 
 
If we discuss about e-commerce of course many experts who have discussed it, E-commerce can briefly be 
interpreted as the process of buying and selling products by electronic or digital means, we can assume that e-
commerce is a liaison or intermediary between interested companies or manufacturers with prospective buyers by 
utilizing internet communication networks. That way consumers do not have to bother going out of the house to 
go to the market to look for needed goods, just through mobile phones or computers we can find all the information 
about the product, choose products according to our tastes, and the goods will soon reach our doorstep, this can 
even save time and costs. 
 
As for the benefits or other benefits of e-commerce, among others for consumers, they do not need to be afraid of 
stores that close when they want to shop even this online store serves us 24 hours nonstop, we can buy goods that 
are not commodity products of the area that are difficult for us to reach even far from where we live, for example 
different countries. While profits for manufacturers can be widespread marketing reach is difficult to reach, sales 
across regions, adding to revenue levels and profits, and providing cheaper alternatives. 
 
But in Indonesia itself there are so many e-commerce that make consumers have a variety of options to find a 
product, with the development of e-commerce in Indonesia making it easier for marketers to open an online store.

In the hypothesis, researchers used bootstrapping calculations in the SmartPLS application, which has several 
criteria for value in their testing. The criterion of the value T above >1.96 is considered to have a significant 
influence, while if the value T is below <1.96 then the hypothesis is considered not significant. And if P Values 
are more than >0.05 then it is considered that the variable has no effect. And Original Simple (O) shows the 
positive or negative of the underlying of a variable.

Based on the results of hypothesis tests that have been tested by researchers, results such as the table 9 are obtained 
as follows:  
 
The Fulfilment/Reliability (F) variable to e-satisfaction (S) gets a coefficient value of (0.410), and a value of P 
(0.001), while the T value of this relationship (3.221) where the T value is higher than >1.96, meaning fulfilment 
/ Reliability has a significant positive effect on customer satisfaction (S). 
 
And the customer service variable relationship (CS) to customer satisfaction shows a coefficient value (0.241) 
and a value of P (0.004) shows that the relationship of customer variables has a positive effect on customer 
satisfaction and has a T value of (2,900) and a value of T above >1.96 which indicates that this relationship has a 
significant positive effect. 
It is known that the influence of application design on Shopee customer satisfaction shows a coefficient value of 
(0.185) which means there is a positive influence on customer satisfaction, but this relationship has a T value of 
(1,267) and a value of P (0.206) which means the relationship between the variables of application desai and 
customer satisfaction is not very influential and insignificant. Although it has a positive coefficient value, the 
application design is not very influential and not significant to customer satisfaction. 
 
Next we see the effect of security / privacy (SP) on customer satisfaction getting a coefficient value of (0.142) 
means that with the security / privacy in Shopee services, this positively affects customer satisfaction, but the 
relationship of this variable is also the same as the previously obtained A value (1,073) and the value of P (0.284), 
which the value T has a value below 1.96 and a value of P above 0.05,  Then this relationship is not very necessary 
in providing satisfaction to customers. 
 
To test the last hypothesis, the effect of customer satisfaction(S) on customer satisfaction. Based on the results of 
the analysis, it is known that the effect of customer satisfaction gets a coefficient value (0.674) on loyalty which 
means satisfaction has a positive effect on customer loyalty. Then satisfaction has a T value above 1.96 which is 
(10,626) and a P value of (0.000) no more than 0.05 which means customer satisfaction has a positive role or 
influence on customer loyalty as much asra significant.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to determine the effect of discounts on interest, selection, and satisfaction in the Shopee food food 
and beverage ordering application service. In the current digital era, food and beverage ordering applications are 
widely used by the public, one of which is Shopee food. Sampling was done by filling out a questionnaire, as many 
as 100 respondents. The analysis was carried out using path analysis using the smartPLS version 3. The results of this 
study indicate that discounts have a significant and positive effect on the selection, interest and satisfaction of 
customers in the Shopee food application. The influence given is also quite significant because it is the strength of 
Shopee food.

1. Introduction 
With the development of an increasingly rapid era, every company/provider of products and services is required to be 
more innovative and creative and must have excellent quality. This is very necessary because consumer desires are 
very diverse and if a company is not creative it will lose its customers slowly. By providing products and services that 
are diverse and of good quality, consumers will trust a company/provider of products and services. 
 
Similar to the food/beverage business, in today's digital era, consumers tend not to buy food/beverages directly because 
many consumers are turning to online. Just by looking at the phone screen and then clicking on it, the food/drink will 
get to the desired place. Indeed, there is a risk that it does not match the image or expectations of consumers. But it is 
very convenient for consumers and saves time. For the payment process, you can only use a digital wallet, or you can 
pay cash when the food/drink arrives. Although online ordering is still relatively new, there is quite a lot of competition 
in the online food and beverage business, one of which is Shopee food. Shopee food is a food and beverage ordering 
service from the Shopee application. Shopee companies, especially in the food and beverage service sector, namely 
Shopee food must have a strategy to be able to continue to grow and have innovation and creativity. This needs to be 
done by Shopee food to retain its consumers. 
 
Shopee food was originally a food/beverage service at Shopee that sells frozen, processed, various cakes, snacks and 
soft drinks since April 2020. However, with the development of Shopee food/beverage services and the increasing 
variety of people's desires, finally on January 10th., 2021 Shopee food comes with a variety of food and drinks such 
as online motorcycle taxis. 
 
With the emergence of Shopee food, consumers have a wide choice of applications to order food and drinks. This 
makes Shopee food must have something to attract consumers. The main effect that will be discussed is the discount. 
Discounts are very influential on customer interest, selection and satisfaction. Discount is a discount from the actual 
price. Discounts at Shopee food are also quite large up to 60% or more with terms and conditions that apply. With 
very tight competition when online discounted food/beverage application services are one of the main factors for 
customers to use applications to order.

Hypothesis Test Results 
Based on the table 7of hypothesis test results, it can be seen above that the results are: 
The variable interest in selection has a value of 0.397 which indicates that if consumers already have an interest there 
is a possibility to choose it. For the T statistic value of 5.242 and the value of P Values 0.000 which shows that it has 
a fairly large/significant effect. So, if a potential customer already has an interest, it has a big enough possibility to be 
an option for that potential customer (figure 1). 
 
The variable satisfaction with the selection has a value of 0.549 which indicates that it has a positive influence. If 
consumers already have high satisfaction, it will be the next choice. The T statistic value is 7,373 and P Values 0.000 
which shows that it has a significant effect. So that satisfaction is an important factor so that consumers choose again, 
if consumers already have high satisfaction, they will choose again. 
 
Based on the variable of interest in satisfaction has a value of 0.700, it means that this variable has a positive and 
significant influence. Interest will create considerable satisfaction if it is in accordance with what is expected by 
consumers. The T statistic value is 8,976 and the P Values 0.000 which shows that interest has a significant effect on 
satisfaction. This means that the interest of consumers has a positive influence on the satisfaction of these consumers. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on this research, it is sufficient to indicate that in the current era people prefer to buy food and drinks online 
rather than directly with the convenience that is currently very easy to achieve, this is based on 114 respondents. It

considerable influence. 
 
Discounts have a large, significant and positive effect on interest, selection, and satisfaction with Shopee food’s 
ordering services. This is enough to indicate that discounts can be one of the strengths for Shopee food to get consumer.

1. Introduction 
This report shows a study of fuel truck options of filling the gas stations tanks in Riyadh city. The fuel could be 
supplied to the stations by the fuel logistics vendors (Outsourcing), or the stations have their truck to fill the stations’ 
tanks (Own a Truck option). The second option “Own a Truck” has two options. First, once you are buying a truck, 
the second option is to own a truck by “Rent to Own “method. For the study period of 36 months (about 3 years), the 
most preferable options will lie on the respective Net Present Value (NPV). There are several types of costs are noticed 
which are fixed, operation, and variable costs that are the effect factors in the transport. The fixed cost includes Truck 
Head Unit and Truck Unit costs which will be paid once at the present time while diver cost and truck insurance will 
be reiterated at the beginning of each year. Second, the operation cost which contains the reparative monthly bases 
cost such driver salary including the allowances and maintenance cost. Third, the variable cost of tires life and truck 
diesel consumption are calculated depending on cost per Kilometer and by finding the average monthly distance of 
the truck trips. Finally, the economic analysis is applied using the basic principles to obtain and discuss the best option 
feasibility. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
This study aims to deploy basic economical tools to provide the best option of fuel transportation in Riyadh City by 
determining all fuel transportation options. Define cost types with effect factors on transportation. And analysis of the 
defined options possibilities. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Annual Worth (AW) is easy to understand for any individual acquainted with annual amounts, for example, dollars 
per year. The AW value, which has the same interpretation as A used thus far, is the economic equivalent of the PW 
and FW values at the MARR for n years. All three can be easily determined from each other by the relation. Sullivan, 
(W. G., Wicks, E. M., & Koelling, C. P., 2015).

6. Conclusion   
From this project, we conclude that for the Own option, the fixed cost for baying the truck head unit and the tank is 
the most capital cost at the present time which cost 422,000 SAR, the driver cost, and truck insurance are costing an 
19500 SAR of annual fixed cost payment while 9700 SAR of average monthly operation cost expenses. The salvage 
value of 150,000 at the end of month 36 was obtained according to the market value analysis. For the Rent to Own 
option, its total the same operation and variable costs the interest amount around 21,840 SAR for the loan Rent to 
Own have a monthly cash flow value of 9273 for the loan expenses (4.44 % APR).  The outsourcing the fuel 
transportation has only a net cash flow of 36000 as monthly average expenses over 36 months. 
 
The own option is the best since it has the highest present value followed by rent to own and outsourcing with the net 
present value. (693991.86), (696331.55), and (1,247,341.79). We could define the cost equation of outsourcing and 
own or rent to own options as shown the figure 3. From the graph the average outsourcing cost expressed as (-0.0141 
x2 + 2.016 x + 300.91) while the operation cost as 0.36 x + 358. The x variable represents the distance in KM. From 
the yellow line, the average operation cost if invested for 1 year with MARR of 9.2% or higher interest, the outsourcing 
will have the opportunity of lower operation cost.

1. Introduction 
Marketing activities, a very important element to be considered is communication, communication, marketing 
activities will take place in such a way and can achieve everything desired. Communication can inform and make 
potential customers aware of the existence of the products offered, and communication can also serve as a reminder 
for consumers about the existence of the product. Marketing communication is one of the marketing activities that 
seek to disseminate information, affect, and / or remind the target market for the company or product to be willing to 
receive, buy, and be loyal to the products offered by manufacturers. (Rumeni and Evawani, 2015). 
 
Sales promotion is a form of persuasion directly through a variety of incentives that can be set to stimulate the purchase 
of a product immediately or increase the number of items that may be purchased by customers. Sales promotion as 
one of the variables of the marketing mix plays an important role in conveying information about the company's 
products to consumers. Companies using the tools of sales promotion to obtain the responses of buyers who are more 
powerful and faster. To understand that marketers must determine the usability, perceptions, preferences, and shopping 
behavior of customers their goals. All the tools of sales promotion are very influential on consumer purchase decisions. 
Sales promotion is a stimulus that can attract the attention of consumers to purchase more. (Hermawan 2012). 
 
The purchase decision (purchase decision) is the advanced stage after the consumer has the desire or intention to buy. 
Wish to buy in general is based on the efforts to fit the motives of the purchase with the attributes or characteristics of 
the brand being considered by involving several aspects such as motivation, perception, attitudes, and integration. 
However, the purchase decision is not the same with the actual purchases. Often times, there is a delay between buying 
decision with the purchase of the truth. The decision-making process complicated often involves some decisions. Sales 
promotion which is good of course will be able to increase the confidence of the brand to a brand (Brand Trust) and 
trust the brand that has been embedded well in the minds of the consumers will surely steer consumers to make 
purchasing decisions for goods or services with the brand. Thus, the management of a company should be able to 
maximize the performance of sales promotion as effectively as possible because in fact the production of sales take 
place either will bring a positive impact on trust and brand purchase decisions.

Abstract 
 
Development of new city needs comprehensive planning to answer urbanization challenges, such as environmental 
crises and socio-economic crises. The natural trait of human activities is destroying nature and a city is the most 
significant place of human activities. Sustainable approaches are important to ensure future's ability to fulfill their 
needs by regulating today's consumption sustainably. Smart city applications are more than just technology, rather 
smart city is a way to achieve better city services and offer highest quality of urban life. Therefore, technological 
usage to achieve sustainability is key for the sustainable smart city concept. This research aims to develop conceptual 
design based on sustainable smart city concept for Indonesia's New Capital. Conceptual design is developed with 
urban planning knowledge based on the result of site analysis and case study from other country city's development 
which later are validated by expert. The result of this research is conceptual design that show spatial and usage form 
with the application of sustainable smart city concept for the construction of Indonesia's new capital.

1. Introduction 
The Indonesian’s government has announced the relocation of the nation’s capital city from Jakarta to East Kalimantan 
Province. The newly relocated city, which later named Nusantara, is planned to relocate administrative function of the 
capital city, while Jakarta remains as the center of economic function. The National Development Planning Agency 
or Bappenas stated that the relocation is done because of the highly concentrated population in Java Island which is 
around 56,54% (Bappenas 2019). This disproportionate distribution of population concentration may impact towards 
further inequality of national economic contribution, with Java accounts for 58,49% of national GDP. With relocation 
taken place, the government hopes to decentralize economic and population concentration into more equitable 
condition. 
 
As a new city development, the new capital city or IKN is affected by the growth of urbanization rate on a global scale 
and its impact to the environment and society. UN estimated with the current rate of urbanization around 6,5 billion 
people will live in urban areas by 2050 (Streitz 2015). With such high rate of urbanization, cities are facing 
environmental and socio-economic crisis, for example climate change, ecosystem damage, socio-economic disparity, 
and regional inequality all of which are mainly caused by high population growth with high consumption of natural 
resources (Yigitcanlar et al. 2019). Major advancement of information and communication technology makes many 
planner and government wants to utilize its technological capability to face environmental and socio-economic crises. 
Here the smart city concept can be explained as the utilization of infrastructure network to increase economic and 
political efficiency also promote social, cultural, and urban development. Nowadays, Smart city have become a global 
movement which promises better ability to utilize city’s natural resources more efficiently, make public transport more 
attractive, and provide data for planner and decision maker to allocate resources effectively (Yigitcanlar et al. 2019). 
 
Through application of smart city concept, city development is guided towards sustainable city, which is a concept 
that focuses on technical result from effective urban transformation from in accordance with sustainability impact. 
Only by combining both concepts, where the application of information and communication technology for the goals 
of sustainability, the concept smart sustainable city can be realized (Yigitcanlar et al. 2019). City is where the most

2678","for this paper comes from relevant stakeholder that have relevant expertise with the topics of planning and IKN which 
is from the governmental agency for planning, specifically IKN secretariat team at National Planning Agency 
(Bappenas) and the head of Jakarta’s Regional Planning Agency (Bappeda Jakata). Both experts have direct 
experience related with the planning of IKN or capital city in Indonesia that can provide insightful takes on the issues 
of smart sustainable city planning in this paper. Structured interview is used as the methods for expert validation. 
From the expert opinion there are a few notes that can be fixed in future research, regarding other planning context 
and information, such as transportation, financial, relocation scheme, and regulation. The main takeaway from the 
validation are the component used for this paper are sufficient, but can be improved by reducing the scope of planning, 
using more robust estimation technique, including more detailed information such as geographical information, and 
using performance indicator to design the application of certain concepts.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper has provided basic information regarding the conceptual design development processes based on the 
concept of the city and situation of the development site. Benchmarking methods used also provided relevant 
information on how other city function and how it can be applied in IKN by reviewing the suitability and other 
sustainability factor to the design alternative. The result shown the composition of land use plan for IKN conceptual 
design and open ways for future research to fill the gap for other planning related question. To conclude, this paper 
has completed a conceptual design for the development of IKN based on the concept smart sustainable city through 
GIS-based site analysis and sustainability evaluation.

Abstract 
 
Augmented reality on the battlefield has the potential to revolutionize tactical decision making, especially in support 
of a multi-domain operation (MDO). Previous work comparing more traditional tools such as sand tables and tablets 
to the newer mixed-reality options do not show clear superiority of the newer technology. However, consideration of 
the surrounding literature suggests that there may be inherent advantages, and design interventions, that ultimately 
improve the utility of augmented reality tools such that they are preferable to previous technologies. Specifically, in 
high-risk activities, such as those encountered in an active battlefield, the augmented reality interface, and the 
information available through that technology, may be designed so as to convey communication advantages. The 
proposed study compares design interventions for augmented reality using a HoloLens 2 to get information quickly 
for tactical decision-making across any MDO with similar representation on a tablet. Using the situation awareness 
framework and cognitive workload measures (based on NASA-TLX), we look at training on augmented reality 
technology to determine the best options. Furthermore, by studying the presentation of augmented reality images on 
the HoloLens 2, we would provide recommendations for how to quickly integrate the technology as a training tool 
and, eventually, a tool in the field. By determining the best ways to provide training on the new technology, the use 
of augmented reality can prevent costly and/or dangerous mistakes that would jeopardize the safety of the warfighter 
and increase the utility of the augmented system in scenarios where maintaining situation awareness is vital.

Abstract  
 
Working in tandem with a leading snack manufacturing company, this project addresses the manufacturer's request of 
developing an MRP system that is flexible and can be easily integrated into the systems used in the company. A 
solution to develop an MRP system using excel was agreed upon as the software is familiar to both the administration 
and the plant managers and is a part of the established workflow. The basics of an MRP system are the three inputs 
those being: Bill of Materials, Demand Forecast, and Inventory status Files. Producing the Desired outputs of a 
production plan and a raw material Ordering Schedule. Using excel as a repository for demand and inventory data and 
taking into factor the material ratios, calculations are done using excel and produce both a dynamic purchase report 
and production schedule. Additional supporting data are also present in the form of pivot tables that show how much 
raw material can be rationed and distributed among products that have common components to further reduce the 
chances of stockouts.  
 
Keywords 
MRP, Excel, System, Logic and Relationships. 
 
1. Introduction  
This research addresses an issue that a snack Manufacturing company faced, that being lengthy order lead times and 
finite inventory space that can only house two weeks’ worth of materials required for production. Thus, an MRP 
system is needed to assist in the decision-making process and provide the required supporting information. While 
there is ready-made software that utilizes MRP calculations and principles, ease of integration and implementation is 
an issue. Introducing a new system to the current workflow of both administrative employees and production plant 
managers would be a heavy investment in both time and money. As inputs for the MRP system need the cooperation 
of both departments to produce the outputs and decisions needed for production. The proposed solution of building an 
MRP system in a powerful and familiar software such as Excel is an optimal solution for both problems as the learning 
curve is greatly reduced to the familiarity of the software and does not require an additional monetary investment. 
MRP on excel also could be flexible without much computer programing knowledge as the inputs such as demand 
can be migrated easily from outside the ecosystem into the MRP and processed into the outputs in the form of a finite 
schedule and pivot tables. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The research hopes to understand and utilize the strengths of Excel while also finding logical workarounds to avoid 
the sluggishness that is often associated with excel programming. Managing this goal is integral as the MRP system

6. Conclusion 
In Brief, the research goals were achieved, and a strategy is proposed as to how an MRP system for snack 
manufacturing companies can be designed without the sluggishness that is often associated with excel programming. 
Excel as the current version of the system produces accurate supporting information and gives insight into many of 
the aspects of the material requirement planning and scheduling process. The relationships and formulas used proved 
to be easily adaptable and can be tweaked manually as needed. Migration of data from other systems into the inputs 
is as easy as copying and pasting without having to adjust parameters. In addition, the system is light and portable not 
requiring significant processing power. The current results tested proved fruitful and additional improvements are a 
possibility.

Abstract  
 
Solar light is a renewable source of energy with no bad impact on the environment. It can compensate for energy taken 
from non-renewable energy sources like petroleum, and fossil fuels. The fabrication of solar cells passed through 
several steps from 1st generation to modern nano-material-based solar cells. One of the good solar cells is known as 
the cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cell which has good efficiency. Thin-film CdTe has been considered the best 
choice for the development of cost-effective and reliable solar cells. Efficiency has been achieved as high as 23.5% in 
CdTe cells in the lab in 2020, and the present techniques for CdTe solar cells stepped towards commercialization. This 
work will investigate the development of the CdTe solar cell in a systematic way that includes its fabrication process, 
back contact selection, parameters impacts, and structural modification which directly impact improving the efficiency 
of the solar cell. In the end, this work will discuss a brief comparison of the improved efficiency with other solar cells 
and its future aspects.

1. Introduction  
Solar energy with great potential among all renewable energy resources, which can be converted into electricity by 
photovoltaic (PV) conversion in solar cell technology (Shabir et al, 2022). PV technology is starting to give a 
significant contribution to the energy sector in many countries (Zaidi et al, 2020). PV technology contributes 4% to 
7% in the USA, European Union, and Germany. The working PV power increased at a very high rate (~30-40%) per 
year in the last 1.5 decades and is growing rapidly worldwide (Zaidi et al, 2019). The efficiency of the solar cells 
increased, and the cost of photovoltaic modules is reduced (Wu et al, 2001). The motivation of the research is the 
increasing demand for energy and the increasing efficiency of the solar cell (Bakiri et al, 2021). As shown in Figure 
1. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
This research focused on the CdTe solar cells efficiency parameters and the comparison of the work with different 
emerging materials. Work will show simulation-based results and a comparison of this work with different materials 
in tabular form.  
 
2. Literature Review 
The cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cell become more important in the market for PV technology. Though CdTe holds 
>7% of the market Si-based solar cells still dominate the market ( Kanevce et al, 2013 ), it is the first in the second 
generation of thin-film technologies to successfully make the increase to truly mass utilization (Sites and Pan, 2007). 
It has a direct 1.5 eV bandgap, with the best optical absorption ~1x103 cm-1 (Wu et al, 2001). CdTe has been shown 
as an eminently scalable technology with simple binary phase chemistry. 22%+  is the efficiency of the modern device 
in Lab and modules have more than 18% efficiency, more than multi-crystalline silicon modules (Hegedus and 
Shafarman, 2004).  
 
It is the lowest per watt technology, have the shortest energy payback time, having less carbon-intensive production 
(Ohyama et al, 1997). CdTe solar cell’s efficiency can push closer to the theoretical maximum of >30% (Jackson,

and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022

2698","two types of cadmium molecules, (1) cadmium sulfide and (2) cadmium telluride. On the contrary, to get maximum 
energy, the simple mixture of these molecules with emerging materials can be used with Si doping to improve 
efficiency (Geethika, 2019). It can absorb more light due to having matching wavelengths with solar light (Li, 2019). 
It is a big advantage of the CdTe which has an ideal solar spectrum range (Luque, 2011). The other thing that makes 
this technology more interesting is the abundance and production of elements as a by-product of zinc, as a result, it 
has low prices as compared to other materials used in solar cell technologies (Green 2007). 
 
Despite these challenges, it also has some challenges (1)  Lower efficiency of the CdTe cell is a big concern for the 
researchers (Wu, 2001), and (2) the abundancy of the cadmium and non-abundance of the telluride is another concern 
that needs to be addressed, the availability of the Te is like 1/5 parts per billion in the crust of the earth. USGS, global 
tellurium production reported in 2017 it was 135 metric tons (Funash 2004). Most of it comes as a copper by-product. 
93 metric tons requires for the production of one gigawatt. The toxicity of the cadmium is another big challenge for 
the CdTe solar cell since the cadmium lies in the top six toxic and deadliest known materials (Jackson, 2014). 
However, the CdTe is less toxic than the element cadmium in terms of acute exposure (pavlovi, 2011). CdTe solar 
cell is the major leading thin-film Photovoltaic (PV) material used in CdTe solar cell due to its near-ideal band gap of 
1.45eV. CdTe has a high optical absorption coefficient for solar light which make it a good competitor for the Si, Ge, 
and many other materials used in the solar cell technologies. 
 
6. Conclusion 
CdTe solar cell progress is significant for years, and improvement of the device performance set a breakthrough in the 
last decade with the design of new device structure and process. The emergence of absorber bandgap, with window 
layers with emerging materials and breaking the 1V with a single crystal is a great achievement. As doping results are 
shown in the paper that it will remain a technology under development, even after decades. Although it has set firmly 
itself as a competitor with silicon. However, more work needs to be done in the development of new compositions of 
the materials for CdTe solar cells. Through many ways like cost-effectiveness, high performance, and refinement

and the flash test are done as a final step  (Green et al, 2007) in Figure 18. The whole general manufacturing process 
is shown in Figure 18. Consequently, there is a large scope that CdTe can be a technology that will remain at the 
forefront of photovoltaic research to make renewable more efficient for foreseeable future.

Abstract 
 
A supply chain or supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to manufacture and distribute certain 
products to final buyers. This network includes various activities, people, entities, information, and resources. The 
supply chain also represents the steps required to get a product or service from its original state for the customer. With 
supply chain management, the supply chain is designed in such a way that it can be carried out in the most effective 
and efficient manner (Vallespir & Alix, 2010). In the current era of globalization where the free market economy is 
carried out by large organizations such as the WTO (World Trade Organization), AFTA (Asean Free Trade Area) and 
APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) which trigger competitive competitiveness between companies so that 
many companies decide to make improvements to its business processes so as to enable the company to reduce 
manpower or reduce activities that can hamper the business processes that have been implemented. In the 
manufacturing industry, many companies are vying to fulfill the desires of their consumers or what is also known as 
a focus on customer orientation, where this focus will have an impact on 3 main points, namely price, quality and 
service (speed, comfort and convenience). quick). most of the manufacturing industries reconstruct their parts so that 
they can focus on customer oriented, the most common step is choosing a third party for the process of shipping goods 
from suppliers of raw materials or materials supporting production activities to distribution of finished goods. goods 
to the final consumer. Until now, the logistics or forwarding business is still in great demand by the public, based on 
world statistics, the freight forwarding sector market for the next 4 years is expected to continue to increase in line 
with the passage of time and the need for various commodities. Third party logistics (3PL) is a manifestation of the 
implementation of a one-stop logistics solution, where third party logistics (3PL) offers services from receiving goods 
to delivery to final destinations. For supply chain business strategy analysis in third party logistics will consider based 
on supply chain integration including internal integration, integration and integration and supply chain operations 
including cost, quality, delivery and flexibility using the PLS-SEM method where the results of the research show that 
supply chain integration has an impact positive impact on competitive advantage i.e. Flexibility, supply chain 
operations have a positive impact on cost and quality and human resource management has a positive impact on 
delivery and quality.

Abstract 
 
Automobile after-sales service Centers (AASSC) act as a crucial part in reinforcing the bond between the service 
centers and customers. There are various needs and expectations for the customers after the vehicle has been 
purchased. These various needs and expectations must be fulfilled by AASSC for making customers satisfied 
which in turn makes customers loyal to AASSC. In the present scenario, the needs or expectations of the customers 
are increasing, and it is changing rapidly. So, AASSC finds it difficult to identify and prioritize the factors that 
meet or surpass the expectations of the customers. From the analysis of the literature it is observed that many 
factors have been identified in the developed countries that will influence customer satisfaction and customer 
loyal at AASSC. However, there are only a few factors identified in the developing countries, particularly in India. 
Further, there are no studies available to rank these factors using any Multi criteria Decision Making (MCDM) 
techniques. Therefore, in this research, first, the various factors that could be responsible for achieving customer 
satisfaction and loyalty to AASSC were identified from the review of the literature as well based on the 
researchers’ perception. Second, the Best Worst Method (BWM), a MCDM technique, is applied to the identified 
factors for prioritizing and ranking them. The findings of the study show that there are ten unique factors 
responsible for achieving customer satisfaction and loyalty for AASSC. Out of those ten factors, the factor: 
Product Quality, Service Quality, and Belief are the most important factor for the AASSC to achieve customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.

Abstract 
 
The number of items having perishable attributes is increasing as science and technology improve, as well as rising 
customer expectations, affecting a wide range of enterprises. Because of its unique characteristics, such as short life 
cycle goods, variable demand, limited forecasting, a higher level of impulsive buying, high market competitiveness, 
and global sourcing, this study focuses on the rapid changes in fashions in the garment industry and the risks that 
apparel industry owners must face. For examining the behavior and links of the fast-fashion clothing business, a 
systematic process with supply chain stages is recommended. The Bayesian Belief Network approach is used to 
analyze the risks associated with all of these goods' supply chain processes, as well as to determine the expected value 
of losses and their likelihood. For successful strategic decision-making and decision-making, many firm scenarios

1. Introduction  
Due to the growing advent of globalization and outsourcing, several manufacturing industries are entrusting important 
sections of their operations to vendors in emerging nations. These phenomena result in a loss of supply chain control 
and visibility, raising the risks associated with any potential changes or interruptions. External occurrences, such as 
governmental limits or natural calamities, are not the only causes of risk; the influence of internal changes in strategy, 
business models, and interactions with supply network players is also a factor(Tang 2006). Clothing supply chains are 
becoming increasingly exposed to both predictable and unpredictable threats. Reduced vertical integration, supply 
chain fragmentation, short product life cycles, constantly altering customer expectations, competitive pressures, 
environmental regulations, and quick technical obsolescence are all possible causes of this dilemma. These threats 
have a direct influence on the garment supply chain's efficacy and responsiveness. As a result, clothing supply chain 
managers must identify and comprehend the risks that their supply chains face in order to develop effective mitigation 
strategies that will improve supply chain performance. The Apparel Supply Chain is being investigated to see if there 
are any potential dangers. This will serve as a platform for identifying hazards in the garment supply chain. The focus 
of our research is on risk factors in the garment industry's supply chain management. We begin by identifying the 
factors and developing a research strategy. Using the method, we hope to find a way to limit the variables. Garment 
supply chains work in a fast-paced environment that requires higher quality, more product availability, a broader range 
of miscellaneous goods, and shorter delivery times. Effective Supply Chain Management can thus mean the difference 
between market success and failure. This research looks at the unique characteristics of this industry at various phases 
of development. This research gives a framework for defining and modifying real and informational flows, beginning 
with a review of the whole Supply Chain with the goal of identifying the most important areas and activities and their 
risk.

Abstract 
 
To accelerate the work of the toll road project located in the area of DKI Jakarta - West Java, it takes accuracy in 
choosing heavy equipment it is very important because it can affect the productivity of the tool, this time the tool 
suitable for excavation work is the excavator. the purpose of this study is to compare between the two types of tools 
in terms of product, work time and operational costs incurred by the project, after being calculated it is determined 
which excavator is more efficient in terms of cost and time for the locations reviewed. Based on observations on the 
field and calculations that have been done, the results are obtained for the volume of soil excavation at the location 
reviewed by 578.34 m3 and for type A excavator’s obtained productivity of 171.86 m3/ hour with a working time of 
8 days and requires operational costs of Rp. 31,856,000, - and for type B excavators obtained productivity of 
109.95m3/ hour with a working time of 12 days and requires operational costs of Rp. 28,184,000, -.

1. Introduction 
Currently, massive development in the field of property carried out by the government to meet the wishes of the 
surrounding community. Therefore, contractors are competing for a project planned by the government, therefore 
effectiveness, efficiency and economy are the attraction in getting a project. In general, every construction project 
uses manual means such as using human power but using human power alone is not enough because it can reduce the 
efficiency of time and effectiveness of work therefore in order to minimize time, heavy equipment is needed to help 
human labor work to be faster (Sigit & Dwitama, 2019). Tool efficiency (in this case is heavy equipment/tools) is the 
condition of the tool that must be taken into account due to field conditions that are not as planned and certain things 
such as topography besides that work efficiency also depends on several factors such as operator expertise, 
maintenance standards and so on which depend on the operation of the tool. The hourly productivity of the tool must 
be taken into account in planning is the standard productivity of the tool multiplied by work efficiency (Fardila, 
Wiranto, & Mudianto, 2017). 
 
Heavy equipment has many types, so the selection of heavy equipment must be tailored to the needs in the field. The 
selection of the right machine can affect productivity and the achievement of job targets. Machine productivity is the 
ability of a machine to complete a job calculated in units of time and that productivity depends on bucket capacity, 
bucket factor, cycle time, and production correction factor. Soil excavation work is the activity of digging to obtain 
materials in the form of soil material from a location, material obtained by digging that is usually done by excavator 
tools with the depth and limits of bricks that have been agreed by contractors, communities, and local governments 
and through the process of consideration and calculation of the impact in the community on the work environment.  
(Fikri, Rahmawati, & Paryati, 2016). 
 
At the end of 2019 there was an outbreak of COVID-19 disease that required the project to adhere to protocols that 
have been created by the government. Such as a 50% reduction in employees, plus the project must also meet the 
contract that has been agreed between the contractor and the owner. With the event can cause construction work to be 
stopped due to the swelling costs incurred by the project, therefore it takes methods that can make the work faster and 
more effective (Bejasekto, 2020). Selection of the right heavy equipment can affect productivity and the achievement 
of work targets. Machine productivity is the machine's ability to complete work which is calculated in units of time 
and that productivity depends on bucket capacity, bucket factors, cycle time, and production correction factors

4.7 Interview Results 
According to the field contractor, between excavator type A and B excavators that are suitable for the research site 
are excavators of type A, because the productivity produced is 56% more than type B excavators, the Type A excavator 
also minimizes work for 4 days. for the condition of the project which was pursuing the target of Eid al-Fitr in 2020 
at that time and 1 more thing that made the contractor choose this type A excavator, namely the efficiency of the type 
A excavator in good condition while the type B excavator in moderate condition, the efficiency of the tool is also 
affect the work of a tool, therefore the reason why field contractors prefer the type A excavator. 
 
5. Conclusion and Suggestion 
5.1 Conclusion 
Based on calculations and analysis conducted on the weight equipment activity between the excavator type A 
excavator used by the project and the excavator type B excavator recommended in this study, the conclusion obtained 
from the calculation above is as follows: 
a. For the volume of excavation obtained at the location of P6 which is 578.34 m3; 
b. For productivity between the two excavators it was obtained for type A excavators namely obtained by 171.86 
m3/ hour while for type B excavators obtained by 109.95 m3/hour;

between the Type A and Type B on this project is 12%. 
5.2 Suggestion 
Based on the above conclusions can be taken as follows: 
a. In future studies you should take a cycle time of more than 1 day to be able to get an accurate comparison; 
b. In future research can take other types of excavators so that more varied results can be obtained; 
c. To anticipate the work of soil excavation to be in accordance with the time schedule, it must choose heavy 
equipment that is in good condition and supported by a professional operator.

Candi Kidal is a cultural heritage building that should be preserved. Besides being a remnant of the ancestors, the 
narrative on the reliefs of this temple is linked to the Indonesian state symbol, Garuda Pancasila. The ATUMICS 
methodology was applied in this study's descriptive method. This method is used in the creation of the initial prototype 
design, the development of form and function, the selection of an icon or character, the transfer of form from an 
artefact to a prototype product, and the determination of the final material for wrapping the product in the form of 
interior accessories. Prototype products, when used in this manner, are a recent approach to preserving cultural heritage 
places. This strategy can be adapted to the younger generation, who are more likely to use technology to understand 
history through modern objects around them.

Abstract 
 
Studies related to consumer behavior in online shopping continue to increase, especially during the Covid-19 
pandemic. Online shopping is related to e-commerce, and it takes trust from consumers to provide a stimulus to 
consumer buying behavior. Examining the phenomenon of the problem, this study focuses on examining the support 
of consumer trust in e-commerce to increase consumer buying interest. The research was conducted by surveying 
consumers who have experience with e-commerce. There were 200 consumers whose data were taken through 
quantitative questionnaires, and the research results were processed to determine the correlation between variables. 
At the beginning, the validity and reliability of the research instruments were tested, followed by the research 
hypothesis testing, and ended with research analysis. The research findings are conveyed that consumer trust in e-
commerce platforms is very important because it can increase consumer buying interest in products or services. There 
are several measurements that are considered in assessing consumer trust in e-commerce including overall trust, 
competence, integrity, and benevolence. There are recommendations for further research to examine other factors that 
can explain changes in consumer behavior in online shopping. Especially recommendations for companies that have 
e-commerce are advised to evaluate consumer trust, so that they know consumer buying behavior

1. Introduction 
Consumer trust in online transactions is an important concern of companies and marketers (Alamsyah & Febriani, 
2020), especially in the citation of the Covid-19 Pandemic where changes to e-commerce continue to increase. The 
limited meeting between consumers and marketers is the main reason for the increase in transactions via e-commerce 
(Y. Chen & Chang, 2012). One of the impacts of online transactions is on online transaction service providers and e-
commerce services that are in line with the expectations of consumers (Alamsyah et al., 2020; Alamsyah & Hariyanto, 
2017; Zheng et al., 2012). Currently, the company focuses on e-commerce with the aim of sustainable corporate 
performance amid the Covid-19 Pandemic (Alamsyah et al., 2021). Examining the phenomenon of online transaction 
issues and corporate sustainable performance, it is important to study consumer behavior through consumer trust in e-
commerce. 
 
Consumer trust can be defined as the reliability and dependability of consumers on products or services (Knight et al., 
2007). This trust will be destroyed when consumers get losses when online transactions are made on e-commerce for

2735","factors including convenience and comfort. The second measurement is competence, namely the ability of e-
commerce to provide a quality platform and have interesting content. Because e-commerce is not formed based on 
one consumer group, but for consumer variants so that it has a broad market share. There is some content that is 
considered interesting and products that are considered quality and easy to find products or services that consumers 
want. In the end, consumers consider e-commerce in line with their competence if they are able to meet consumer 
needs. The next measure that needs to be considered in assessing consumer trust in e-commerce is integrity which 
explains the security of the platform. The security of data and transactions that occur during transactions is very much 
needed by consumers and this is a concern for all e-commerce platforms. Because it can threaten the sustainability of 
e-commerce and consumer confidence. Experts are needed to maintain e-commerce from the company, so that all 
transactions can be kept confidential. The last thing to pay attention to is benevolence which means ease of interaction 
and ease of interaction online can be needed. Consumers always consider the ease of service to be a benchmark in the 
ease of transactions, so that online services still need to be considered by companies.  
 
Consumer buying behavior is ultimately able to be supported by consumer trust, so suggestions for companies that 
focus on e-commerce are to participate in maintaining the quality of e-commerce so that consumer confidence is 
maintained. There are many advantages of e-commerce for companies and consumers, one of which is efficiency and 
effectiveness in online transactions and the convenience that can be done anywhere 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study of consumer trust is interesting to note in the field of management science, because consumer trust 
contributes greatly to consumer decisions. There are many theories that explain the concept and measurement of 
consumer trust, but it is found specifically studying e-commerce that there are four things that can form consumer 
trust. The dimensions formed for consumer trust are overall trust, competence, integrity and benevolence. On the other 
hand, consumer trusts are recognized as having an impact on consumer behavior, namely purchase intention. Through 
this research, it is hoped that the company will be able to measure consumer trust with the aim of increasing consumer 
buying interest. Companies certainly have a big share in solving consumer trust, because this study indirectly gives 
hope to companies towards sustainable performance. This research was studied in theory and found several 
assumptions with the model related to consumer trust, but it was not studied empirically to prove it to consumers. 
Based on these limitations, it is recommended that further research be carried out to confirm and refine current research 
that focuses on empirically examining the dimensions of consumer trust in relation to increased consumer buying 
interest in e-commerce

Abstract  
 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is detrimental to the community; therefore, it is necessary to take actions that 
can minimize the spread of COVID-19 so that business sustainability can be maintained. One way to minimize the 
spread of COVID-19 is to reduce physical contact using hands. However, based on observations, it is known that there 
are no available tools in Indonesia that are used to avoid hand contact with the toilet door lock. This of course can be 
a means of spreading the Covid-19 virus. Therefore, in this study, a foot-operated toilet door lock was designed and 
made so that it is expected to reduce the spread of the covid-19 virus. Foot lock product design was carried out using 
the Quality Function Deployment method. Customers’ needs were identified by using interviews and questionnaires. 
Quantitative measurements were conducted to identify priorities, which consist of respondent satisfaction level, goals 
and sales points, improvement ratio, and row weight. The research continued with the development of technical 
responses (HOWs) to meet customers’ needs and then the house of quality was developed. Alternative design concepts 
were developed using a morphological chart. The selected design was then made into a foot-operated door lock and 
tested for ease of use. The foot lock that has been made has an outer dimension of 308 x 126 x 121 mm.

1. Introduction  
The spread of the COVID-19 disease that continues to increase in Indonesia has a negative impact on the country's 
economic growth in the industrial, mining, development, trade, and other sectors. The continuous spread of Covid 19 
and the increasing number of cases also make the performance of an organization or company decline. Based on the 
impact of the spread of the COVID-19 disease that is detrimental to the community, it is necessary to take actions that 
can minimize the spread of COVID-19 so that business sustainability can be maintained. One way to minimize the 
spread of COVID-19 is to reduce physical contact using hands. Prevention of physical contact with hands is very 
important because the hands are the body parts that generally touch the eyes, mouth, and nose, where these parts 
become a means of transmitting COVID-19. By preventing physical contact using hands and washing hands regularly, 
it is expected to minimize the spread of COVID-19.  Touch-free handle and interface is one method to reduce Covid-
19 transmission (Barnes and Sax 2020). 
 
With the aim of minimizing the spread of COVID-19, many tools have been made to avoid physical contact with 
hands. These tools can be in the form of sensors on parking ticket machines or foot-operated hand soap dispensers. 
Based on observations, in Indonesia, there is currently no foot-operated toilet door lock. The problem is that the lock 
handle on the toilet door can be a source of spread of disease because it is generally used and touched by hand so that 
the hands can be contaminated by viruses and bacteria. According to Pan et al. (2021), although SARS-CoV-2 is 
transmitted mostly by respiratory droplets and direct contact, but it turns out that viral RNA fragments have also been

Based on table 8, it was known that the average time to open the toilet door using a foot lock was 5.14 seconds, while 
the average time to open the door latch was 4.75 seconds. In other words, the time to open the toilet door using a foot 
lock was 8.21% longer than using a latch. The total cost of materials used to make the second prototype of the foot 
lock is Rp. 60,946.30. Currently, there is a similar product called Merino foot latch, manufactured by Merino company 
in India which can be seen in figure 13. Its dimension is 131 x 118 x 49 mm (length x width x height). The material 
used is stainless steel (SS304). The mechanism to open and close the latch is by sliding it to the left and to the right.

6. Conclusion  
This research has produced a foot lock, which was a foot-operated toilet door lock so that it can maintain the 
cleanliness of public toilet users and hopefully can reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The foot lock outer 
dimension was 308 x 126 x 121 mm. To further ensure the stability of the toilet door in a locked condition, it is 
recommended to improve the foot lock design with a locking mechanism in the center of the door.

Abstract 
 
Accelerating the realization of an elderly-friendly city is essentially an effort to deal with the increase in the 
elderly population in the future. Elderly-friendly cities also aim to help the elderly to easily access public 
facilities and activities, especially for the elderly who live alone. If the elderly is left with no activity, especially 
economic activity, then the elderly will become a socio-economic burden for the country. In addition, increasing 
age also has an impact on declining health and physical abilities, so elderly-friendly cities must also consider 
reducing transportation costs and public facilities and providing recreational and reflection facilities which can 
be in the form of open spaces and special shared facilities for the elderly. This study aims to build a model of an 
elderly-friendly city by taking into account a number of factors such as a city that has a set of regulations 
governing the elderly, has regional leaders who are committed and have priority to the protection of the elderly, 
has an elderly-friendly document method. in accordance with WHO provisions, and elderly-friendly facilities. 
The research design is included in exploratory research, with a sample of 128 respondents and the sampling was 
done by non-probability convenience sampling. The results showed that there are important factors that can be 
modeled mathematically through factor analysis which identifies the representation of Safe and comfortable,

The results of data processing from the distribution of the questionnaires that have been made obtained an 
average value of 6.383 (from a scale of 0.000 - 10.000), then from the former model a simulation can be made to 
see the values that can be expected as improvements and values that are not expected and should be avoided by 
the school.

Based on Table 5. the simulation results show several conditions that can be used as decision making for the 
elderly-friendly cities in the future. Explanations related to these conditions are: 
 
Normal conditions, meaning that the analysis value of elderly-friendly cities in normal conditions is currently 
6.383 (from a scale of 0.000 -10.000), where there is no addition or reduction in value because it can be 
considered that no research has been carried out. From the data, it can be seen that the current level of elderly-
friendly cities is visible 
 
Unexpected condition means there is no concern with elderly-friendly cities so that the assessment decreases to 
the lowest value, in this condition it is considered a condition where ignorance of the system results in a 
decrease in overall system performance. Simulation by reducing the value of the positive factor to the lowest 
value and increasing the value of the negative factor to the highest value, the results obtained are 5.489 which 
is included in the category of ""Rarely"" utilization.  
 
Expected condition mean the effort that can be increased to reach the maximum value, where all new factors 
found can be optimized to achieve high performance so that the gap between the realization target and its 
achievement can be minimized. This value of 9.452 falls into the ""Frequent"" category so that if elderly-friendly 
cities system development is carried out in accordance with the decreasing defect, it can be used as the main 
worksheet in the dissemination process of elderly-friendly cities. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the research (analysis) and discussion (synthesis) that have been described in the 
previous section, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
 
1. The level of understanding of the elderly-friendly cities issues for the study area in the form of 6.383 (from a 
scale of 0.000 -10.000), for research in 2020. 
2. Safe and comfortable, Smart public service, Excellent information, and Easy health care are factors that 
influence the elderly-friendly cities from the community's point of view. 
3. The built model is a function, Y(X) = the elderly-friendly cities.

Based on the results of the discussion and previous descriptions about the limitations of the study, there are 
several suggestions that need to be submitted as follows: 
1. For the Ministry of Environment, cooperate with academics to immediately determine forms of the elderly-
friendly cities. 
2. For academics, carry out further research related to the pattern of utilization of systems and information 
technology for environmentally friendly solutions in accordance with the concept of sustainable 
development. 
3. For the local government, immediately make a policy on environmental management and preservation and 
continue with socialization activities for the elderly-friendly cities.

Abstract 
 
A very crucial process in the operation of an airport is the management of baggage, especially in monitoring the 
movement of baggage, starting from the passenger handing the item over to the airline officer at the airport of origin 
until the item is received by the owner at the destination airport. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) 
as the organization that regulates provisions regarding baggage management issued resolution 753 regarding the 
baggage monitoring process to be implemented by all airlines. This paper discusses post-flight baggage management 
in accordance with the current regulations. The analysis results obtained indicate the need for technological 
innovation in the baggage handling process so that the potential for damage to loss can be minimized.

Abstract 
 
Periodic evaluation of service quality by the company is a routine activity that aims to improve company 
performance. Every decision taken by the company's leadership will affect the company's performance and 
organizational performance in general. For this reason, it is necessary to build a system dynamics model that is 
able to describe the current conditions that apply in the company and is able to do simulations to see conditions 
in the future. This study proves that the model built with a standard model for changing targets can simulate 
environmentally friendly service quality targets to customers with an overview of current achievements and 
forecasts of future achievements. Future achievements are influenced by the control value of achieving Service 
Level Agreement, Reopened and Response Time, where the greater the control value, the greater the correction 
level value so that the gap will be smaller. The correction rates determined in this study were 10%, 20% and 
30% of the gap size.

5.  Conclusion 
From the results of this study, it proves that the model can describe the extent to which the target achievement is 
achieved within a certain period of time, while the conclusions from the results and discussion of this research 
are as follows: 
1. Simulations carried out with several scenarios are expected to assist in decision making, by setting the 
correction rate of 10% of the GAP, the target achieved in 2025, when the correction rate is increased to 20%, the 
target will be achieved in 2022, and when the correction rate is increased to 20%, the target will be achieved in 
2022. the correction rate is increased again by 10% to 30% the target is achieved in 2021.  
2. Factors that affect the company's performance is the service quality factor that is not achieved in accordance 
with the target. The factors for not achieving service quality are due to not achieving SLA, Response Time and 
Reopened. The achievement of the minimum Response Time in 2019 was 83.75%, while the maximum 
achievement of Response Time and Reopened was 100%, there was no significant GAP for the achievement of 
Response Time and Reopened, but there was still a downward trend from the target that should have been 
achieved. The main cause of these factors is the absence of controls that are able to control the achievement of 
targets as expected by the company.

ABSTRACT 
The traditional service engineering organizational model, developed through specialization, has led to repeatable, 
high-quality results, a highly focused workforce, and a dependable knowledge base.  However, this model also limits 
career development, restricts employee engagement, and fails to optimize resource allocation to the changing business 
needs of the customer. 
 
By implementing principles of lean to break down silos across the organization, it is possible to transform an 
engineering organization, offer a wider knowledge base among resources, more effectively utilize the engineering 
staff to meet high- and low-volume workload demand, and increase employee engagement.  
 
Employee engagement is important for the aforementioned reasons, but there is an additional element that should be 
a focus for strategic resource planning and implementation.  A key benefit to increased employee engagement is the 
link to productivity.  This paper will explore a case study for improving productivity and employee engagement 
congruently.  The case study was successfully piloted in an aviation service engineering organization, and results over 
a one-year pilot project are shared.  As a result, a tangible way to develop staff, elevate morale, improve productivity, 
and increase throughput of deliverables is possible.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Introduction  
 
 
Organizations widely recognize the importance of improving employee engagement.  Employee engagement is 
defined as “…those who are involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace” (Gallup 1).   
James Harter & Amy Adkins report that “Less than one-third of Americans are engaged in their jobs in any given 
year” (Adkins 1). 
 
So why is employee engagement important?  What factors are contributing to a low percentage of the workforce 
feeling engaged in their work?  Are there solutions to this dilemma?  This paper seeks to ask these questions, apply 
some lean tools to explore root cause and find solutions to the problem.  Evidence of how important this topic is to 
companies can be found by analyzing the level of focus organizations are putting on understanding this topic better.  
In the Harvard Business Review, Chief Executive Officer of Virtuali, Inc. Sean Graber says, “Each year, companies 
are spending nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in an effort to improve employee engagement” (Graber 1).

5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
5.1 Conclusions 
 
Gallup has collected years of data that reveals a flat 30-34% employee engagement of workers.  Companies are 
reported to spend millions of dollars to learn and improve this metric, without much historical success, presumed by 
the data collected from Gallup, Inc.  Yet, if a careful look at the problem from the team level is taken, allowing the 
staff themselves to explore root cause and develop solutions to address the problem unique to their organization can 
not only yield improved employee engagement, it can benefit the bottom line and offer opportunity for business 
growth.  In fact, Amy Adkins of Gallup says, “Employee engagement is a leading indicator of future business success, 
and Gallup has discovered close ties between engagement and outcomes such as turnover, profitability, and 
productivity” (Gallup 1).  Inviting staff members to have an integral part in the effort toward improving employee 
engagement, and allowing them to define what it means within their organization to be engaged and how to improve 
it is a take away from this project analysis.  Wide ranging benefits to the organization likely will result by following 
the steps of the method prescribed in this paper.  The reader can take this developed method, study for applicability, 
and apply it across industries for improving employee engagement and optimizing utilization of the service 
engineering workforce. 
 
All three objectives of the project were met.   Root cause analysis of the three problems identified with 
specialization within the service engineering organization was performed utilizing several lean tools used in 
recognized problem solving methodologies such as DMAIC.  Solutions were tested by performing a pilot program, 
accomplishing the second objective.  The final objective of the project, to develop a method that can be used for 
improving employee engagement and utilization of the service engineering workforce, was successfully 
documented, implemented into an aviation company with success, and proposed for wider use. 
 
5.2 Recommendations and Future Studies 
 
In this case study, improving employee engagement was achieved, demonstrating that lean tools can be an effective 
way in contributing to finding root cause of organizational obstacles toward this goal, and that there can be productivity 
may increase through similar methods utilized. 
 
Another future study could include a deeper understanding of what criteria motivates even the engaged staff member 
to leave a company.  Further study on key factors and levers, in this case, could be studied in understanding how the 
organization can increase the likelihood of retaining a high performing and engaged staff member.

Abstract  
 
The aim of this project is to design a new E-bike sharing system for an Italian city following the Industrial Design 
Structure (IDeS) research method. The service will be addressed mainly to visitants and tourists and has the purpose 
to be suitable for customers of all age groups and body sizes. The IDeS Method allows to organize the development 
of the product in an efficient and systematic way: it englobes methods like quality function deployment (QFD), 
benchmarking (BM), top-flop analysis (TFA), stylistic design engineering (SDE), design for X, prototyping, testing, 
and planning. In the presented study all the stages of the process are shown and applied to achieve a final product that 
embodies the requirements obtained from the Market Analysis, the starting point of the methodology. Developing 
IDeS up to its final stages, it is possible to get a complete and ready-to-sell vehicle thanks also to the use of innovative 
tools which allow to virtually insert it in a real environment.

1. Introduction  
Industrial Product design has become a complex package of activities that involve all the subdivisions of a company. 
It becomes essential to obtain much information as possible from the customers to which the product is directed and 
from the competitors that sell a similar product, especially for what concern the service offered in the same market.  
The Industrial Design Structure (IDeS) method shows a sequence of various activities with the aim to develop a 
complete stylistic and technical analysis in order to optimize internal resources and accelerate the time to market of a 
new product. Being a method that embraces several departments of an organization, the final result is an innovative 
product that can be directly placed on the market. IDeS method is widely studied and developed inside the Department 
of Industrial Engineering (DIN) at Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, but this research differs from the 
previous ones based on the same working mode because the scope is not only to develop a new vehicle based on what 
the customer needs, but an entire service. Finally, the purpose of this publication, together with other relevant 
publications about the design of a new product from the DIN department of Bologna, is widespread the knowledge 
and the use of this method.  
 
During this project it is possible to see the development of a new e-bike sharing system, thinking for the tourism sector 
in Italy. In fact, one of the most popular ways for tourists to get around the city is by riding a bike and, at the moment, 
the main competitor in the bike-sharing market in Italy is “Mobike”. The name of the service that will be developed 
during this paper is “BICY”, a word that is strongly linked to the Italian language with the meaning of “bike”. The 
main objective of the BICY project is to allow the tourist to enjoy a renovated Italy-icon to visit the city center, also 
in order to promote more sustainable transport systems from a green perspective. Currently, electric bicycles are one

2790","5. Results and Discussion  
The innovative choices and solutions adopted for this product allow obtaining a system that respects all the objectives 
of the project. Firstly, the vehicle is not only thought in order to promote sustainable mobility inside the city, but its 
design has the aim to reduce the environmental and visual impact of the station inside the city center, thanks to the 
possibility to close the bike in a limited space. In addition to this, the idea of a “Green Island”, as a charging and 
parking station, helps to reduce the visual impact on the cityscape and ,the plants and hedge around them, are pleasant 
to see.  
 
The starting point of the project was to renovate a traditional “Graziella” frame to realize an innovative bike-sharing. 
The three final solutions obtained are characterized each by a distinctive character, but always recall the icon of Made 
in Italy.  
An important aspect that must be considered in the definition of a bike-sharing system is the choice of the components: 
all the moving parts are thought to guarantee limit vandalism or damages. For example, the use of airless tires, which 
now are starting to be tested on vehicles, permit less maintainability.  
 
It is important to highlight that the starting point of the application of the IDeS method is the market analysis; so the 
customer’s requirements and the study of competitors can only permit to reach a product to be appreciated once 
inserted on the market. Nowadays, in an increasingly frenetic market, it becomes essential to put the customer in the 
middle of the realization of the product, thinking about what he wants and, thanks to this method, following the steps 
proposed, it is possible to gain a foothold in the market in a short time. 
 
The IDeS method utilized here to develop a new e-bike sharing system for an Italian city wants to underline the 
importance of appropriate communication between all the departments responsible for the product development. The 
innovations of the method are in the use of matrices that permits to achieve decisions, in an efficient and precise way, 
and to arrive at an optimization of the resources used to obtain the final result; to gain this, the method utilized the 
latest technologies of Industry 4.0, like AR and 3D- printing in order to share the choices adopted.  
 
6. Conclusion 
With this project the efficiency of the application of the IDeS method is demonstrated, arriving to have a product ready 
to be inserted into the market. It shows how following a systematic approach with a complete method it is possible to 
achieve an innovative product in terms of use and shapes. One of the key aspects of the BICY project is to realize a 
foldable e-bike sharing system, satisfying the objectives of sustainable mobility and reducing the environmental and 
visual impact. A strength of this method is the final prototypes phase, that allows to apply the new product in a real 
environment thanks to the rendering and the AR, and the possibility to touch a precise model of the vehicle with hand, 
thanks to the resin 3D printing.  
 
The approach proposed with the IDeS method can be used by the companies to interact with all the organizational 
levels, also achieving the involvement of all stakeholders, necessary to have an industrial efficiency driven by a 
product customized for the customer.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 technologies are transforming manufacturing worldwide.  Many companies struggle to successfully 
implement these technologies.  To drive successful implementation, it is useful to understand Industry 4.0 technology 
applications and successful strategies.  Industry 4.0 technologies utilize data and successful applications must involve 
data collection and management, data analytics, and automation.  The value proposition of Industry 4.0 is in turning 
data into usable information in such a way as to improve business results.  Review of case studies shows that quality 
applications are common cases of success for Industry 4.0 technologies.  The data driven nature of Industry 4.0 lends 
itself to the skills of quality professionals.  Taking a quality driven approach to implementation may be a successful 
strategy for those businesses with quality as a strategic focus for competitive success.  Quality professionals already 
in possession of data skills and continuous improvement mindsets are well suited to drive digital transformation.  A 
model for a Quality 4.0 implementation strategy is developed through thematic analysis of the literature on Industry 
4.0 and case study analysis of successful Industry 4.0 implementations.

1. Introduction 
Industry 4.0 is an important topic for the future of manufacturing.  It can be described as the application of digital 
technologies to enhance our capabilities through data and information usage, and has been characterized as the fourth 
industrial revolution (Schwab, 2017).  In spite of this shift towards digital transformation less than 30% of such 
transformations are reported as being successful (De la Boutetière, Montagner, & Reich, 2018).  Low success rates 
for implementation point to an opportunity to develop strategies and guidelines for digital transformation.  This 
opportunity is further highlighted by a limited amount of literature on Industry 4.0 implementation (Pozzi, Rossi, & 
Secchi, 2021).   
 
Due to positioning within an organization along with skills in data collection and utilization, quality departments have 
been identified as potential drivers for Industry 4.0 implementations (Nicole M Radziwill, 2018).  Quality 
professionals may also be strong candidates to drive Industry 4.0 efforts as many Industry 4.0 use cases are focused 
on quality improvement (Jacob, 2017).  Early research on the topic of Industry 4.0 also shows overlap with Total 
Quality Management (TQM) methodology as a potential success factor in an Industry 4.0 strategy (Babatunde, 2020).  
The quality discipline shows potential to have major influence on digital transformations within industry and a quality 
centered approach to Industry 4.0 deployment is worth exploring.

2804","Figure 4 - Quality 4.0 Implementation Model 
 
This model suits the quality professional as it mirrors the traditional Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle of continuous 
improvement.  Quality skills are likely to be critical across all steps of the implementation process.  During the problem 
identification phase, it is critical to identify an appropriate problem.  An appropriate problem in this model is one in 
which there exists the potential for data collection and application in such a way that the usage of this data will directly 
influence the outcome of the process.  Problems in which useful data cannot be conceptualized or collected in a way 
that isn’t significantly cost prohibitive to the effort are not appropriate.  Problems which are not standard or repeatable 
enough for data to be modeled consistently are also not appropriate.  Conceptualizing the data use case and strategizing 
how to augment the human system, phases one and two in the model, are tasks appropriate for quality departments 
already versed in data skills with data driven mindsets.  The third and fourth phases in the model are broader and will 
require diverse skill sets.  For the implementation and lessons learned portions of the process, the quality department 
may engage with a team including production, IT, engineering, and other groups, however as the goal of these 
implementations is centered on improving business performance through data usage it is likely that quality 
professionals may still be the most appropriate owners of this process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Industry 4.0 is affecting the entire global business landscape.  It goes well beyond quality departments or the quality 
profession.  Due to the data centered nature of Industry 4.0 and the established data skills and focus of the quality 
profession, Quality 4.0 may be an appropriate strategic approach to the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies 
for the purpose of improved business performance.  The context of the business and its core competencies and market 
strategies are relevant in determining how to initiate a digital transformation and Quality 4.0 is not the only appropriate 
approach to Industry 4.0 technology deployment.  Quality professionals are well positioned within organizations to 
enhance digital transformation strategies, and quality driven digital transformation should be considered by companies 
with quality as a key business focus.

Abstract  
 
The economy can be affected by movements in housing prices through multiple channels. House prices in Malaysia 
increased 0.3 percent YoY in March 2021, following a 1.2 percent YoY increase the previous quarter. This current 
study employs an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) examine the relationship between GDP and housing 
prices (HPs) in Malaysia. This study is using quarterly data over the period 2011:1 to 2020:4 for the six variables such 
as gross domestic product (GDP), housing prices (HP), lending rate (LR), exchange rate (EXCHR) and world 
governance indicators (VAA, PS, GE, RQ, ROL and COC). The results of ARDL cointegration tests running from 
housing price to GDP provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that hosing price and economic growth are 
cointegrated.

1. Introduction 
The 2008 economic and financial crisis and subsequent years demonstrated the importance of the housing market for 
both financial stability and economic growth. Many economists and policymakers agree that house prices have a 
significant impact in driving economic growth or decline. Due to wealth effect, the rising of house prices encourage 
consumer spending which lead to higher economic growth. According to the Property Market Review 2021/2022 
reported by Rahim & Co (2021), Malaysia recorded 201,065 property transactions totaling RM98 billion, a minor 
decline of 1.8 percent in volume year on year. From 2016 to 2020, Malaysia’s house prices rose by annual average of 
7.2%. In Malaysia, Housing Index is measured by the annual change in the House Prices. Housing price index is one 
of the widely used indicators in real estate property market as it portrayed the general fluctuation of housing prices 
across the period. On top of it, housing price index served as a broad indicator for the operation and transaction of the 
property markets (Kassim, Redzuan, & Harun, 2017; Xin, Burhan, & Diah, 2019). The index is based on the hedonic 
approach to price measurement using multivariate regression analysis with 1990 as the base year. The index provides 
70 sets of house price indices for 14 states and five regions, as well as for Malaysia as a whole. According to NAPIC,

6. Conclusion 
This paper has investigated the nexus between housing prices (HP), economic growth (GDP), lending rate (LR), 
exchange rate (EXCHR) and world governance indicators (voice and accountability, political stability, government 
effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of Law, and Control of Corruption) in Malaysia over the period 2011Q1 to 
2020Q4 by using ARDL model. For stationarity analysis of selected variables, the study used unit root tests. The ADF 
and PP unit root tests showed that all the time series variables are stationarity at level I(0) and at  first difference I(1). 
To conclude, house prices is associated with GDP. Moreover, the coefficient of ECT was found to have negative value 
and statistically significant. This means that short-run relationship between Malaysian housing price and economic 
growth exists, and the speed of adjustment was found to be approx. 36 percent in order to return to the long run 
equilibrium. Furthermore, the study performed stability, and diagnostic tests.

Abstract 
 
One of the major expenses to operate facilities is the cost of energy. An education enterprise such as school 
facility requires every year major budget consideration for the consumed electricity; especially, facilities 
need to be powered day long. This project tries to an analysis of adding basic improvement technology for 
dorms in a typical public-school by using investment recovery approach. Equivalents flow model has been 
developed to the consumed electricity system for five years term, and used to test the improvements. 
Analyzing the result showed the payback period is 6.275 years while the lifespan of windows tint on average 
lasts 10 years, therefore investing in this technology instillation is strongly supported decision to decrease 
the amount of electricity consumed which provides more saving in the budget as a result of annual 
evaluation.

1. Introduction 
One of major expense for schools is the cost of electricity, so the school wanted to investigate ways to 
reduce electricity costs. If problem the dorm equipment is losing efficiency over longtime and annual 
budget tiles to different priorities, then engineering solution need to step up showing feasible alternatives 
to control energy consumption. The most feasible and applicable alternative planned to explore in this 
analysis research work offering a valid option to measure school economic improvements. Improvements 
need show difference in bill cost saving, and not to raise the budget. Therefore, the purpose has been set 
for this research work is to explore savings in the form of energy-efficient facility; specifically, school’s 
dorms. The goal is to analyze different approaches to make the dorms more energy efficient and in a cost-
effective manner. Building gating was the first to examine in terms of functionality of open and close in 
addition to venerate the air and sun light the rooms. One of the focus found significantly influencing the 
hosing performance is the dorm window system, the size compared to the weather outside and room inside 
in addition to the mounting setup of sealing around were obviously improvement opportunities. Window 
tinting is the technology this work proposed to process in terms of adding fill to the windows of buildings. 
The purpose is to reduce the amount of heat and radiation that enters the building. This then reduces the 
amount of cooling that must be completed to keep the building at temperature in the hot weather of southern 
area. Searching for the breakeven point, create a cash flow model, and provide a conclusion about whether

6. Conclusion 
Cash-flow modeling is a powerful toll to plan economic alternative over long term budgeting. Since on average the 
tinting technology lasts 10 years and the 6.275 years to pay for itself, this is a worthwhile investment for the dorm 
facilities to make. The remarkable about this solution is that it can be implemented on any building around campus.

Abstract 
Geothermal energy has potential to be used as a clean renewable energy source to power the nation. This 
study evaluates the techno-economic assessment for setting up a 10-megawatt (MW) geothermal 
electricity based plant in Lubimbi, Zimbabwe. Neohexane was chosen as the conversion organic fluid of 
geothermal brine to geothermal electricity at 73 ℃. A total investment of approximately USD 40 million 
is required to establish the 10 MW plant with a plant life of 30 years. An off-taker tariff of USD 0.14/kwh 
against a leveled cost of production of USD0.08 was proposed. A rate of return of 3.2% and a payback 
period of 7 years was achieved. The proposed development will contribute 0.5% to the energy 
requirements in the country.  
Keywords: Electricity generation, geothermal energy, levelized cost of energy, techno-economic assessment 
1. Introduction
Previous studies have estimated that geothermal energy production will reach 140 GW (gigawatts) by the year 
2050 (Bertani, 2009). In Africa, countries like Kenya and Ethiopia have already started tapping geothermal 
electricity with both countries generating 29 MW (megawatts) and 7 MW respectively (Bertani, 2007). Geothermal 
energy can be used for directly heating individual buildings and to heat multiple buildings with various options 
shown in Figure 1.

and in this case, it’s the electricity generated from the geothermal brine. Revenue is directly influenced by sales 
level as sales increases the revenue also increases. The revenue from this study was calculated as represented by 
Equations 26-29.

8. Conclusion  
There is potential for green electricity to be generated from geothermal energy resources abundant in Zimbabwe. 
Neohexane can be used as the fluid of choice to aid the conversion of the geothermal brine to electricity at 73 ℃. 
The implementation of this project is quite capital intensive and a proposed off take tariff of USD0.14/kwh is 
proposed. A total of USD 40 million is required for generation of 10 MW with a rate of return of 13.2% and a 
payback period of 7 years for a plant life of 30 years.

Indodax Instagram followers.  
2. 
The influence of brand awareness on Indodax Instagram followers Indodax's brand awareness platform is in 
a good category with a total overall score of 78.95%. This indicates that the Indodax platform already has a good 
brand image, most Instagram followers already recognize and understand Indodax as a crypto asset investment 
platform.  
3. 
The influence of Instagram social media marketing on Indodax brand awareness The regression coefficient 
value of 0.979 indicates that there is a significant partial influence of social media marketing variables on brand 
awareness which means that the higher the value of social media marketing, the higher the positive brand awareness 
value. The correlation coefficient value (R) of 0.670 is used to calculate the value of the coefficient of determination. 
The determination coefficient is 0.448 which means the influence of social media marketing on brand awareness is 
44.8% while the rest is influenced by other variables outside the scope of research.  
4. 
Investing in cryptocurrencies has a high risk, as it has extreme volatility, is prone to cybercrime and has a 
dependence on technology. 
 
6.2 Suggestion 
6.2.1 Practical Advice  
1. 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis on social media marketing variables on Instagram collaboration 
dimension with the statement ""there is a form of cooperation between followers and Indodax in promoting Indodax"" 
obtained a percentage value of 68% of the statement has the lowest percentage value compared to other statements. 
For this reason, it is recommended for the Indodax platform to always involve its Instagram followers in all activities 
regarding activities or campaigns in an effort to promote Indodax, related to crypto asset investment in the hope that 
there will be a good and mutually beneficial relationship for both parties.  
 
2. 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis on the consumption dimension brand awareness variable with the 
statement ""I feel the Indodax platform is better than crypto investment platforms or other brands"" obtained a 
percentage value of 74% the statement has the lowest percentage value compared to other statements. Indodax 
platform should strive to keep providing information and improving its services both in terms of the use of applications 
and websites regarding crypto asset trading. This is done so that public trust increases so that the Indodax platform 
remains the best investment platform compared to other competitors.  
 
6.2.2 Theoretical Advice  
1. 
For readers who will research about factors that can affect brand awareness, it can be done by adding other 
independent variables, such as marketing mix, price and others.  
2. 
For subsequent researchers with the same variables are expected to use different objects and research methods 
to see different points of view for the reader.  
3. 
For readers who will make crypto investments should be equipped with sufficient education about all aspects 
related to the investment, such as procedures for buying and selling crypto assets, reading ongoing trends, determining 
the right strategy in managing finances and others in order to always get returns that are in line with expectations and 
do not experience losses.

online shopping, ordering to deliver a product or service effectively and efficiently (Santika and Pramudana 2018). 
Quality of service with customer satisfaction is a factor of a company's success to achieve competitive advantage with 
other companies. With good service quality, it can create customer satisfaction.  
 
Satisfaction is a person's feeling of pleasure or disappointment that comes from a comparison between his impression 
of the performance (or results) of a product and his expectations (Kotler and Keller 2016:153). Meanwhile, according 
to Maulida (2021) explained that e-customer satisfaction is When online products and services exceed consumer 
expectations, the level of buyer satisfaction after comparing the purchase experience and perceived expectations with 
the post-purchase experience online. So it can be concluded that e-customers satisfaction is the level of consumer 
satisfaction with a product or service online related to the fulfillment or not of consumer expectations or expectations. 
If the quality of service obtained by consumers can meet consumer expectations, consumers tend to feel satisfied and 
there is a lack of flexibility.  
 
Santika and Pramudana (2018), defines e-customer loyalty as a customer's favorable attitude towards online business  
that results in repeated buying behavior. It can be concluded that e-customer loyalty is the interest of consumers to 
repurchase a product or service online due to dissatisfaction after use.  
 
 
It can be concluded from several complaints about the quality of Zalora application services above that the e-service 
quality of the Zalora application is not optimal so that it makes its users feel aggrieved. Where many users complain 
about the quality of service such as delays in delivery, unilateral cancellations, failed login access, to live chat 
customer service that is expected to help the difficulties of its users is even considered less helpful so that users feel 
displaced. E-service quality or electronic service quality is something that shows how e-commerce  sites serve and

Abstract 
 
Due to the worldwide epidemiological crisis, the biomedical engineering sector, as part of the Egyptian Public Health 
Administration, has become under intense pressure to play a vital role in delivering appropriate healthcare services in 
the country and improving its performance. Most medical equipment maintenance centers in the country have 
struggled to provide functional medical equipment in the public healthcare sector while keeping up with huge repair 
orders to meet the growing needs of medical devices to provide quality services at affordable cost. Hence, there is a 
great need to deploy continuous improvement and waste elimination methodologies such as lean six sigma (LSS) in 
the biomedical engineering sectors to promptly enhance the process capability to return repaired equipment to the 
field. This article aims to present a case study on the application of Lean Six Sigma methodology at a medical devices 
repair center in Egypt. A comprehensive analysis of the entire process has been carried out to reduce the lead time of 
the repair by improving the entire process. The results indicate that lean six sigma can be applied effectively to improve 
the availability of functional medical devices in public hospitals in Egypt.

4. Conclusions  
This paper demonstrated how LSS was successfully utilized in Egypt's public health system to reduce the repair time 
of medical devices. LSS is a long-term method and despite being time-consuming, it guarantees a proper problem-
solving approach for the maintenance process. A large data collection sheet was created to collect all the measured 
data for 80 medical devices to assess the current state of the repair process. Results from FMEA indicated that the 
process of finishing paperwork for functional devices has the highest RPN. The implemented solution was 
transforming conventional methods related to the paperwork of all sub-processes in the repair center into a web-based 
system. Furthermore, the follow-up processes transformed into electronic-based methods. Consequently, the step of 
finishing paperwork, which has the largest influence on delaying the entire repair process was eliminated.  This work 
showed the power of integrating the PDCA cycle with LSS throughout the control phase ensuring continuous 
improvement

Abstract 
 
Training models in machine learning often requires big computational capacities, even more when it involves Big 
Data. The Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM), introduced as a bump hunting algorithm and a subgroup discovery 
method, already consumes a lot of computing resources when searching for the rules. In this computational research 
area, several methods have been developed to handle the problem of computing a big dataset: parallel learning, 
distributed learning and federated learning.  In this paper, we investigate the literature review of these three methods 
to define each one and the differences between them, and then we determine which of these methods is best suited for 
the implementation of PRIM in big dataset for out futur works in Big Data.

1. Introduction 
Everyday a huge amount of data is generated forming at a large-scale Big Data (Sagiroglu and Sinanc, 2013). 
These data are characterized by the commonly known five Vs: Volume, Variety, Value, Veracity and Velocity. The 
Volume of big Data mainly brings up the issue of imbalanced data between the classes in a binary classification 
problem. The Variety of big Data means that a data has multiple sources. The Value, often considered as the most 
important V, refers to the explainability of the knowledge induced from mining the data for the domain’s problem it’s 
used for. The Veracity refers to the truthfulness of the data in the dataset, or as considered in today’s machine learning 
literature, the fairness of the data collection and, thus, the fairness of the model trained on this data. And finally, the 
Velocity indicates the frequency of the data collection and its influence on the Volume, hence on the model and the 
other Vs. 
In order to use machine learning algorithms to build models on big data, the main problem is the volume. 
From supervised to unsupervised learning, deep learning or reinforcement learning, using any of these machine 
learning approaches can lead to hours of processing and calculations, and make testing, evaluating and improving a 
model nearly impossible. To palliate to this issue, researches have investigates throughout the decades, several ways 
to generate the results. Among those techniques the most popular and used ones are the distributed learning, the parallel

2886","performance that scores very well in comparison with some other popular methods as CART, the authors all 
stressed out the time and the computing resources needed to achieve a satisfactory outcome. For these reasons, 
we aim to dress a guideline for future works in big data.  
4. Case of PRIM for big data applications 
Performing machine learning algorithms in a distributed environment first involves conceptually converting 
single-threaded algorithms to parallel algorithms. Diverse parallel techniques are used for the distributed computing 
process. This step can often be the most difficult because it is algorithm-specific and requires that the user has a strong 
understanding of the underlying algorithm. Whether we are going to use distributed systems or parallel systems to 
compute PRIM on a large-scale dataset, parallelizing the algorithm is the very first step. PRIM has got some meta-
parameters to tunes: the peeling criteria, the pasting criteria and the minimum support. To find the optimal combination, 
experts usually compute a lot of possibilities different chosen subsets. 
There are different ways to parallelize the algorithm. The first one concerns the parallelization of the database. 
Indeed, by setting a combination of meta parameters, one can partition the dataset into several on the present nodes, 
and thus run the algorithm on each partition independently of the others. In order to recover the most optimal result, 
one will have to group all the boxes found and use either an optimization method such as metarules (Berrado and 
Runger (2007)) to create rule association between the rules and thus reducing the set of the rules, or use the principle 
of Ensemble Learning (Dong et al.(2020)), and create for every partition a model and then do the average of them all 
to obtain an optimal model for the whole dataset. 
The second way of parallelizing PRIM, concerns the parallelization of the different combinations of meta-
parameters as well as the different dataset partitions. In the case where the expert has a large computing capacity, 
especially in the case of a distributed computing system, the expert can select a few possible combinations of meta-
parameters that he considers the most suitable to obtain the best rules, and thus create a list of tests of combinations on 
each partition. Although the computation time will be high, at the end of the process, the expert will have not only the 
exhaustive set of rules found, but also the performances for each combination of meta parameters. 
The last way to parallelize PRIM would be to parallelize the different search subspaces. Indeed, one of the 
particularities of this algorithm is that the expert chooses upstream the attributes that will represent the search space of 
the rules. Moreover, in the case where the expert would like to test several search possibilities, we could apply the 
same approach as for the search of the optimal meta parameters. Note that in the case where one would like to test 
several combinations of subspaces as well as several combinations of meta parameters, the complexity of the learning 
process increases and would risk losing its scalability. In this case, we recommend a feature engineering, feature 
selection and even an exploratory step of the dataset as well as an in-depth analysis of the domain problematic in order 
to identify the few possible combinations or subspaces and to reduce the complexity.  
 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we give an overview of the three used techniques for computing a large-scale dataset in machine 
learning: parallel learning, distributed learning and federated learning. Each one of these techniques, is best suited in 
a case and addresses a different issue from the others. In the case of the Patient Rule Induction Method, we have three 
main components to use it for machine learning: choosing the search space, choosing the meta parameters and working 
with a high dimensional big dataset. In this case, and according to our review, we highlight that the application of 
PRIM on big data will depend on the domain. Indeed, if the experts already know which subset and meta parameters 
are the best for the rule search, the parallelization will concern only the data which will be split into different partitions. 
And then, to recover the overall model, one could consider it as an ensemble learning, or can consider all the boxes 
and then turn to pruning techniques. In the case of searching for the optimal meta-parameters’ combination, the 
parallelization will concern computing in each node a partition on a combination. Therefore, the complexity will 
increase because on each node there will be a partition and a list of meta-parameters’ combination possible. And the 
third case, concerns the search subspace. Again, the complexity increases and the time computing too, which lead us 
to stress the importance of the domain analysis for any size of data in machine learning. As for the Federated Learning, 
the use of it depends on the data policies concerning the privacy.

Abstract 
 
Blockchain (BC) technology is developing in every sector, and it guarantees to solve many problems concerning 
security, privacy, and trust. BC is not a separate technology; it combines technologies in computer science and 
financial applications. When BC technology is assessed concerning agri-food processes, it is stated that it can be a 
quality solution to support transparency and help to build trust in the agri-food sector. Concerning all the benefits and 
paradigm changes in the agri-food chain, understanding the BC technology is the first step before including it in the 
existing environments. Knowing the key factors affecting the BC efficiency and application may be an excellent way 
to start and investigate the developing technology. Accordingly, this paper aims to create an assessment methodology 
for the BC technology from the smart agriculture (SA) perspective. The 2-Tuple linguistic (2-TL) model is used with 
multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools. The 2-TL model is a linguistic-based analytical approach that can 
eliminate information loss during the translation stage. While evaluating emerging technology, a linguistic-based 
methodology could be more understandable for practitioners and researchers. The DEMATEL method is utilized in 
this study’s framework thanks to its ability to check the interdependence among the proposed criteria and extract their 
interrelationships. Evaluating these relationships can help companies increase the efficiency of their own evaluation 
processes. A case study to test the plausibility of the suggested framework is also given with detailed results and 
discussions.

1. Introduction  
Blockchain (BC) is developing in every sector, and it guarantees to solve many problems concerning security, privacy, 
and trust. Notwithstanding its reputation and the great attention obtained from public and private sides, the technology 
is still far from being well comprehended. It is enclosed by a great deal of overemphasis and hype. BC is not a separate 
technology; it is the combination of technologies in computer science and financial applications (Ajwani-
Ramchandani et al., 2021). Technologies involved in these areas contain public/private key cryptography, 
cryptographic hash functions, database technologies, primarily distributed databases, consensus algorithms, and 
decentralized processing. In a nutshell, BC’s principal aim is to attain database reliability and integrity with distributed 
decentralized database background (Alicke et al., 2017). 
 
When BC technology is assessed concerning agri-food processes, it is stated that it can be a quality solution to support 
transparency and help to build trust in the agri-food sector. Today, in the agri-food industry, the data is audited by 
third parties. The data is stored instead by paperwork or in the central data center. These two approaches are away 
from being well-organized due to the errors, corruption, and inefficiency of paperwork. BC technology offers a 
solution that the existing transparency and trust mechanisms cannot handle. These information problems pose a severe

2894","The suggested linguistic-based technology assessment framework is also validated in this case study, and it also 
showed its plausibility.  
 
The examination of cause-and-effect relations allows the possibility of better analyzing the technology and its 
enablers. It also allows creating a roadmap to follow during the technology transfers. Highly affecting dimensions are 
needed to be considered when choosing the right supplier. In our case study, Operation and the Vendor Related Issues, 
the interoperability of BC technology and the vendor’s specialties possess critical importance for BC technology.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper aims to create a linguistic information based MCDM model for BC technology evaluation for SA. As 
aforementioned, BC is seen as a ground-breaking technology for various sectors. Agriculture is one of the fields where 
the need for secure and traceable products is rising; therefore, this paper targeted the agriculture sector for BC 
technology integration.  
Since BC is an emerging technology, the impreciseness about the notion still exists for practitioners. So, this paper 
first targets to create an index for important dimensions and sub-criteria for BC technology. The same methodology 
also allows us to see the cause-and-effect relations between these dimensions; thus, this framework guides 
practitioners to precisely understand BC technology. Moreover, the same framework may also guide the policymakers 
or DMs in the organizations to select the most appropriate technology supplier according to their needs.  
In this paper, three different DMs are used during the case study. The number of DMs could be a limitation for this 
paper, yet according to the literature, the number is enough to reach an objective solution (Büyüközkan et al., 2021). 
Yet, for future studies, the number of DMs could be increased. Also, an appropriate technology supplier selection 
framework can be integrated with the existing one. The same 2-TL approach could be integrated into the supplier 
selection stage as well.  
Moreover, the same 2-TL-DEMATEL methodology could be applied to other smart technologies to understand better 
their purpose, enablers, and drivers.

Abstract 
 
The goal of this paper is to investigate the relationship between students’ attitude toward the subject of mathematics 
(ATM) and their achievement in mathematics (AIM) in the context of online schooling. Further, this project seeks to 
compare the AIM-ATM relationship of students who take a math course online with that of students who take math 
in a physical classroom setting. While previous studies have explored the AIM-ATM relationship, the results have 
been inconsistent, and none have been performed in the age of digital learning. In this project, the data were collected 
from 144 high school respondents through a Google Form that was shared on social media and several forums. 
Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) tests were conducted on the AIM and ATM data provided by 
respondents, and further testing was done on the demographic characteristics of the respondents in order to control for 
confounding variables. The results suggest that there is a positive, monotonic relationship between AIM and ATM for 
students taking math online, but there is no AIM-ATM relationship for students taking math in-person. No 
demographic characteristics appeared to influence AIM except for sex. These findings have the potential to affect 
future pedagogical methods for mathematics.

1. Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for the past two and a half years. During this period of time, educational 
systems across the globe have been reshaped dramatically as schools and universities closed to prevent the spread of 
the virus. As a result of the inability to meet in person, online schooling programs became widespread. This new 
method of learning has understandably affected both how courses are taught and how students learn. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
Although previous research papers have investigated the relationship between students’ attitudes towards the subject 
of math and their levels of achievement in their math classes, most of these studies were conducted before the 
advent of online schooling. Besides, many studies concerning this subject had conflicting results; while some 
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between achievement in math (AIM) and attitude toward math (ATM), 
others show that the AIM-ATM relationship is quite weak. This paper seeks to: 
1. Investigate the relationship between AIM and ATM for high school students who attend school online, 
2. Compare the relationship between AIM and ATM between high schoolers who take math online and those 
who take math in brick-and-mortar schools, and 
3. Provide new data to this pre-existing body of research and clarify prior inconsistent findings. 
The ultimate goal is to explore the AIM-ATM relationship in the context of the digital age. 
 
2. Methodology and Data Collection 
To recruit respondents for this project, a Google Form was posted on Instagram® and sent to various social groups 
and public forums; 151 respondents were recruited. These respondents included students attending Stanford Online 
High School (SOHS) as well as other schools. Each respondent provided their age, race, and sex. They were also 
asked to provide:

2905","does not affect AIM. The R2 value for the regression test is only 0.0066, which indicates that the linear model does 
not fit the data well. 
 
4.4 Age, Sex, and AIM 
A multiple regression test was performed on age, sex, and AIM of respondents to determine if there was a relationship 
between the three variables. To perform this test, a dummy variable for male respondents was created. For this test, α 
is 0.05. The relevant hypotheses for this test are: 
H0: there is no relationship between age, sex, and AIM. 
Ha: there is a relationship between age, sex, and AIM. 
 
The test yielded a t test statistic of -1.3715 and a P-value of 0.1724 for the age variable, which again is not statistically 
significant and indicates that there is insufficient evidence that there is a relationship between age and AIM. There is 
a t test statistic of 2.0127 and a P-value of 0.046047734 for the sex variable. This result is statistically significant. The 
coefficient of the sex variable is 1.0420, which suggests that, if someone is male, they are predicted to have a 1-point 
higher rating of mathematics than their female counterparts, given that age is fixed. The R2 value for this test is low—
only 0.0344—but higher than that of the age-AIM regression test. 
 
4.5 Age, Sex, Grade, Method of Schooling, Math Course, and AIM 
To determine if demographic characteristics (age, sex, etc.) affected respondents’ AIM scores, multiple regression 
analysis was performed on sex, grade, method of schooling, and math course. In order to perform the test, dummy 
variables were assigned to each of the respondent traits. For this test, α is 0.05. The relevant hypotheses for this test 
are: 
H0: there is no relationship between AIM and any of the other variables. 
Ha: there is a relationship between AIM and at least one of the other variables. 
 
None of the variables yielded statistically significant P-values except for sex. The dummy variable for female 
respondents yielded a coefficient of -0.9591 and a P-value of 0.04217. These results indicate that the only demographic 
characteristic that affected the respondents AIM was sex. . 
 
5. Results and Discussion  
5.1 Analysis of SRCC Results 
The difference in the results of the SRCC tests between respondents taking math online and in-person suggests that 
the method of learning mathematics has an effect on students’ AIM and ATM. Online schooling could possibly 
establish a more predictable relationship between AIM and ATM for students as opposed to in-person learning, which 
has positive implications for the educational system during this period of the new normal. 
 
5.2 Analysis of Regression Results 
Regression analysis illustrates that, largely, demographic characteristics, such as age, do not affect students’ AIM. 
However, sex does appear to have a relationship with AIM, where female respondents generally had a less favorable 
view of mathematics. This may reflect upon the systemic discrimination that women continue to face in STEM fields 
and the misogyny that female students are confronted with in classrooms. Other factors, such as race, may have an 
affect on AIM, and further testing is necessary to the influence of such aspects. 
 
5.3 General Analysis of Results 
The sample size for respondents taking math in-person was much smaller than that for respondents taking math online, 
which may have affected the results of the statistical tests. Most respondents are female, and they are likely to be 
Asian or white. The majority of respondents are older students taking challenging math courses. Some respondents 
commented that social factors, such as their interactions with their teachers and peers, impacted their ATM. 
 
6. Conclusion  
While a relationship between achievement in math and attitude toward math was found for all respondents, when 
comparing online and offline math learners, this relationship only appeared to exist for respondents taking math online.

2912","These findings may encourage more schools to shift their method of teaching mathematics to an online method, which 
may produce more consistent results of achievement. The lack of association between AIM and ATM for students 
taking math in-person corroborated previous research investigating this relationship (Ma and Kishor, 1997). The 
statistically significant result for the first SRCC test is likely due to the relationship between AIM and ATM for 
respondents taking math online. Regression analysis highlights the need to ensure that female students are given the 
same treatment as their male peers in the math classroom. Overall, further sampling and testing are required to clarify 
the discrepancy in results for respondents taking math online versus those taking math in-person.

Abstract  
 
This paper consists of designing of nine speed gearbox and the procedure for calculating the number of teeth on gear 
including structure and ray diagram. For analysis, the gearbox assembly is created in CATIA and Analysis is 
performed in ANSYS. Also deformation is attained as the gear efficiency depends on the deformation. A mechanical 
device called a gearbox that transforms the torque and speed of a rotary power generator to the output shaft. The torque 
transferred reduces when there is a rise in shaft speed, and likewise. Multi-speed gearboxes are utilized in cases where 
the speed or the torque there at the output shaft must be varied often. Gearboxes operate on the idea of teeth meshing, 
resulting in power transfer and the motion transfer from the input source toward the outputs. To achieve the needed 
speed differences, a gearbox is constructed by attaching several gears in a proper speed ratio. Gearboxes often feature 
many groups of gears that are strategically arranged to achieve various speed variations. The synchromesh, Sliding 
mesh, and constant mesh gearboxes are the three kinds of gearboxes. Sliding and stationary gears are the two main 
types of gears in a sliding mesh gearbox. Sliding gears are installed on splined shafts so that they may move along the 
shaft's axis and mesh with possible combinations of gear. The result shows     that the deformation, maximum stresses 
and elastic strain are under safe limits.

Lastly, it concluded that as per the design criteria, it has designed the gearbox and the design made by us is safe and 
satisfactory and can be proceeded with the production process. Also the stepwise solution of the present work would 
be beneficial as per an aspect of time and reducing complexity for designing the gearbox. The ray diagrams are used 
to make the design more feasible concerning the number of teeth used in gearbox and transmission ratio. The analysis 
shows that the gearbox can carry maximum stresses and deformation under the safety zone. Based on the results, spur 
gear with a higher module is preferred if a large amount of power is required to transmit.

Abstract  
 
Logistics encompasses every facet of the supply chain planning and transportation, which empower the growth of 
trade and commerce. The term ‘green logistics’ focuses on operations efficiency, reliability, and reducing the 
environmental burden on social life. The awareness regarding environmental impact and sustainability as applied to 
best business practices becoming more prevalent. This study draws attention to the green logistics practices that 
logistics managers can lead to the initiative in their daily decision-making process as means to achieve business 
excellence and sustainability. Green logistics noticeably contributes to improving the reputation of companies and 
raising the level of organizational performance. Adoption of green logistics in supply chain and logistics operations 
mitigates waste and environmental pollution and improves the overall firms’ performance. The fact that expands on 
logistics needs for an ever-growing population is so engrained in our daily lives and business practices that 
sustainability will not attain unless there is a hardcore implementation of green logistics management practices. 
Companies pioneers in green logistics applications successfully interlinked the logistics operations with environmental 
impact and society to achieve a suitable target. This goal study is to draw interest among the small businesses and 
retailers becoming involved in the application of green technologies and green logistics.

Abstract 
 
The main objective of Lean Manufacturing tools is to eliminate waste from a process in order to make it more efficient. 
In this applied research with a quantitative approach, the production process of a steel coil cutting machine (Slitter) 
of a Peruvian metalworking company is analyzed. It can be said that the Slitter is indispensable to supply semi-finished 
products to a steel tube production line. Likewise, improvements are proposed and implemented based on three lean 
manufacturing tools in order to increase their availability, which hardly exceeds the value of 60%. One of the tools 
implemented was the single minute exchange of die (SMED), which is aimed at reducing machine preparation times 
(setup) by reorganizing internal to external activities. Another tool used was Kaizen, which seeks continuous 
improvement and standardization of processes through simple and concrete actions. Finally, the 5s method was applied 
to improve the cleanliness and order of the work areas. After these, the time available to produce increased 95.73 
hours per month, which means an improvement of 17.36% in machine availability. Also, setup times and operation 
cycle times were reduced by 16% and 16.35% respectively.

1. Introduction 
The incipient development, mainly technological, has led to low competitiveness in organizations in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. Underdeveloped or developing countries such as Peru allocate a very small part of their total budget 
to the area of research and development (R&D) (Inter-American Development Bank, 2016). According to the Inter-
American Development Bank (2016), “the labor productivity of innovative companies in Latin America is, on average, 
50% higher than those that do not innovate”. For this reason, given the lack of investment in R&D in some 
organizations, it is essential to adapt and implement lean manufacturing tools in order to increase their competitiveness 
(Wilches et al. 2013). The lack of production processes that use contemporary technology makes it necessary to take 
full advantage of resources and facilities to succeed in the global market (Issamar et al. 2019). 
 
The implementation of these tools arises from the need of a company in the Peruvian metallurgical sector to increase 
the availability of a machine that supplies semi-finished products to one of its main production lines. Specifically, it 
seeks to determine the influence that the implementation of lean manufacturing tools such as the single minute 
exchange of die (SMED), the 5s and Kaizen can have on the availability of the Slitter machine of this company. This 
indicator hardly exceeds 60%, which negatively affects the weighted value of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). 
Values between 75% and 85% are considered ""acceptable"". However, to qualify as “good” in the market, the value of 
85% must be exceeded, which is within the parameters of the “world class” category (Algara and Sierra, 2018). For 
this applied research, the goal is to increase availability up to 74%. Also, it is worth mentioning that it is possible to

13","problem. To solve this, an OPL was implemented to ensure the correct functioning. Likewise, a formula was developed 
to determine if it is necessary to remove the scrap before starting a new cutting process, in order to avoid stops due to 
scrap removal reasons during production. With this, it was possible to reduce machine downtime due to this type of 
problem by 77%. 
 
Finally, the order and cleanliness of the work area was another of the unscheduled stops for production reasons that 
had a high representation. Therefore, within the heads assembly and coil cutting activities, 13 and 12 minutes 
respectively were included to perform this task. To standardize order and cleanliness, an OPL was implemented 
(images were included to standardize the conditions in which the work area must be found). Aspects such as cleaning 
process waste such as cardboards, straps, roll paper, metallic elements, wooden planks and steel dust are the most 
critical points, because they sometimes hinder the mobility of personnel under safe conditions. Also, it is important to 
note that the 5s were applied for the order of the tools (previously explained). With these improvements, it was possible 
to reduce this type of stops by 73%. 
 
5.4 Validation  
To validate the hypothesis, the upper tail test was performed for the statistical operator of the population mean with a 
known standard deviation (σ). For this, the number of samples n = 48 was used, which complies with being greater 
than 30, therefore it is considered adequate (Anderson et al., 2008). The steps for the calculation and the results 
obtained are detailed below. 
 
Hypothesis: The implementation of lean manufacturing tools in the Slitter machine will increase its availability. 
H0: The implementation of lean tools will allow an increase in the availability of the slitter machine ≤ 74% 
H1: The implementation of lean tools will allow an increase in availability of the slitter machine> 74% 
 
Confidence level = 95% 
α = 0.05 
x̄  = 0.7465 
µ0 = 0.74 
n = 48 
σ = 0.0172 
 
Calculation of the Z test statistic: 
Z = 
0.7465-0.74
0.0172
√48
 = 2.61 
 
Calculation of p-value: 
P (Z>2.61) = 1-0.9955 = 0.0045 
 
Now, the rule for rejection using the p-value is used, which indicates that H0 is rejected if the p-value ≤ α (Batanero, 
2001). For this research, with the data presented, a p-value = 0.0045 was obtained, which means that the probability 
that x̄  = 0.74 or less is obtained, if the null hypothesis is true, considered as equality, is 0.0045. Therefore, since 0.0045 
is less than α = 0.05, H0 is rejected. In this way, it is concluded with a significance level of 0.05, that sufficient 
statistical evidence was found to reject the null hypothesis and, consequently, the alternative hypothesis H1 is 
validated. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The increases of 17.36% in the availability and 10.37% in the productivity of the Slitter machine show that it is not 
necessary to make large investments in the latest technology to improve the competitiveness of companies. What 
really matters is to know the processes accurately and have detailed information about them. With this, problems can 
be identified and solved through the application of lean manufacturing tools. 
 
According to data from the Slitter machine, setup time represented 27% of the hours available for production; and 
unscheduled stops, 17%. From this, it was concluded that the activities involved in the setup needed to be reorganized 
and standardized. Likewise, it was concluded that it was also necessary to train operators in order to avoid unscheduled

22","stops. For these reasons, it was determined that SMED, Kaizen and 5's were the most appropriate tools to mitigate 
these problems. 
 
It was shown that with the application of SMED, the project's base tool, machine setup times can be considerably 
reduced and activities that do not add value can be eliminated. In the present applied research, setup times and 
operation cycle times were reduced by 16% and 16.35% respectively. First, the process activities were classified as 
internal or external. Then, a time study was made to determine how long each activity takes to be finished and to 
identify operations that are performed inefficiently or that do not add value. With this, the process was reorganized in 
order to make it more efficient by increasing external activities and reducing internal ones.  
 
On the other hand, the implementation of Kaizen and 5s was crucial in reducing machine downtime due to unscheduled 
stops. The development of One Point Lessons (OPL) and manufacturing instructions were helpful in reducing micro 
stop time, generating easy to understand visual aids for operators, identifying problems, and optimizing and 
standardizing activities. In the same way, the implementation of the 5s was useful to reduce the stop hours due to order 
and cleanliness.  
 
In addition, it´s important to mention that the hypothesis was statistically verified with a p-value = 0.0045 which, 
being less than α = 0.05, confirms that the implementation of lean tools will allow an increase in availability of the 
slitter machine greater than 74%.
