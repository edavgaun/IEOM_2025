Abstract 
The main objective of this article is to find an adequate hydrological development plan worldwide, taking into account 
the resources that Peru has, through different databases such as scientific articles, magazines, and national and 
international theses, demonstrating that various countries have a relative abundance of water resources that represent 
a large percentage of the world's water capital. The methodology presents four methods for the calculation of the 
future population and later the calculation of the necessary flow to supply the high Andean population. 
The results are presented using two methods: graphic and numerical. Based on the results, an interpretation of the data 
obtained was made. Finally, this paper provides conclusions that are based on the decrease in water supply in the high 
Andean areas, for which it was possible to estimate the demand for water for the development of the high Andean 
areas and an improvement in the quality of life for their population. In summary, it has finished analyzing the 
approximation between the years 2022 and 2037 as well as the data collected for the investigation.

1. Introducción
In recent years, awareness has begun to be raised about the importance of the entire population having a water supply, 
and even more so of having an estimate of how the population is increasing and how it will continue to be supplied in 
the coming years. Water governance is a broader concept than water management. (Moench 2003). and refers to ""the 
range of political, social, economic, and administrative systems that exist to regulate the development and management 
of water resources and the provision of water services at different levels of society"" (Rogers and Hall 2003). Over the 
past few decades, considerable progress has been made to expand access to water and sanitation services globally.  
The lack of drinking water in rural areas of our country results in the presence of acute diarrheal diseases (ADD) in 
its population, which are the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age (according to WHO 2019), 
due to That is why it is critical that all populations have complete access to safe drinking water.However, ""Water 
scarcity can be defined as the point at which user consumption affects the supply or quality of water, such that the 
demand cannot be fully satisfied."" (The UN Refugee Agency 2019). That is why, according to the WHO/UNICEF 
Joint Monitoring Program (JMP 2017), the number of people who access basic water and sanitation services increased 
from 350 million to 700 million in the world. In addition, according to data from the World Resources Institute (WRI 
2019), more than 1,000 million people currently live in regions with water scarcity, and up to 3,500 million could 
suffer from water scarcity in 2025. The projection mentioned above is very worrying, and in Peru there are still many 
places that do not have that water service, as our study area does not have this basic service, specifically the Rancha 
Populated Center, which is taken as an example to present the changes that the population will have during the 
following years in relation to its lack of water.

6. Conclusions
•
The methods presented have been updated and corrected over time (1993, 2007, and 2017); as a result, the
method that behaves most appropriately with the data provided by the INEI is the simple interest method,
because finding a population in rural areas is more feasible.
•
The future population obtained and benefited, which makes us notice that it is possible to reduce the water
supply deficit in our country. Only in Huamanga would the gap be reduced by 7% of the non-beneficiary
population.
•
The research carried out shows us the reality that Peruvians live in the high Andean (rural) areas without
access to drinking water. In the particular case of the Rancha Town Center, it was possible to estimate the
demand for water for the development of the Town Center and an improvement in the quality of life for its
population.
•
The maximum daily flows and maximum hourly flows have been calculated for the town of La Rancha, for
its subsequent conduit and distribution design.
•
According to the article, we have a future population in which there is a slight increase, and with this, we
have already found the population intercensal rate using the formulas with which the reserve volume that will
supply the population will be determined.

Abstract 
Crowdsourced delivery is a potential solution for last-mile challenges. It requires a critical mass of both customers 
and couriers, whose expectations need to be matched. This proves to be difficult in developed countries, but might be 
easier in developing ones. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether matching stakeholder expectations 
for crowdsourced local delivery is easier to achieve in developing than in developed countries. A framework with six 
expectations is designed and tested with an online survey conducted with potential customers and couriers in Sri Lanka 
and Germany. Results show that matching stakeholder expectations is easier in Sri Lanka than in Germany. Out of the 
six expectations, three were better aligned in Sri Lanka and three were equally well aligned.

1. Introduction
E-commerce is rapidly growing. Until recently, this growth took place mostly in more developed countries. Yet, this
trend is changing as internet proliferation in the developing world continues to rise (Alwahaishi et al. 2009). The E-
commerce growth in developing countries presents two challenges: a large increase in shipping volume (World
Economic Forum 2020) and local SMEs becoming uncompetitive (KPMG and Snapdeal 2015).
First, a surge in online sales results in more packages being delivered affecting the last-mile delivery. By 2030, this 
trend is estimated to cause 36% more delivery vehicles in the top 100 cities globally, leading to additional 6 million 
tons of CO2 to be emitted and additional 11 minutes on passengers’ daily commute (World Economic Forum 2020). 
Developing countries are ill-equipped to deal with these challenges. Traffic congestion there is rampant due to limited 
road infrastructure and lack of traffic management resources (Bashingi et al. 2020). The environmental Kuznets curve 
(EKC) hypothesis, economic growth causes environmental degradation during the early stages of economic 
development, is prevalent in developing countries (Al-Mulali et al. 2015). They struggle to straddle the fine line 
between economic growth and curbing their CO2 emissions (Al-Mulali et al. 2015). An increase in last-mile delivery 
emissions is likely to make this challenge even harder.  
Second, local SMEs that are not able to integrate E-commerce into their business models will become un-competitive 
(KPMG and Snapdeal 2015). For example, only 27% of SMEs with an online presence in India utilize E-commerce 
(KPMG and Snapdeal 2015). This disparity is due to inadequate financing and support (KPMG and Snapdeal 2015).  
One potential solution to those drawbacks caused by E-commerce growth is the use of crowd-based platforms for 
crowdsourced local delivery (Chen and Chankov 2017). Crowdsourced delivery, or crowd-shipping, is a concept that 
hinges on citizens delivering goods to each other along their way (Ciobotaru and Chankov 2021). Ideally, there would 
be minimal detour, hence minimizing the environmental impact associated with the delivery (Paloheimo et al. 2016). 
Crowdsourced local delivery consists of last-mile delivery for E-commerce or brick-and-mortar stores (Carbone et al. 
2017).  
One of the main obstacles for crowdsourced delivery is the chicken-and-egg problem (Rougès and Montreuil 2014). 
A critical mass of couriers ensuring fast service is needed to attract customers, but at the same time a critical mass of 
customers is needed to feed the couriers (Rougès and Montreuil 2014).Very few crowdsourced delivery companies 
have managed to address this pain point, with many of them failing to establish a lasting market by attracting a critical 
mass of both couriers and customers (Punel and Stathopoulos 2017). This is evident by the closure of UberRUSH and 
other such initiatives that have gone out of business (Ciobotaru and Chankov 2021). To solve the issue of critical

Table 13 summarizes the alignment of the studied expectations and reaffirms this notion. Out of the six expectations, 
three were better aligned in Sri Lanka (a developing country) and three were equally well aligned in both countries.  
When shopping online, consumers prioritize delivery time and costs (Kovač et al. 2017). Due to the nature of 
crowdsourced delivery, delivery time and costs are greatly influenced by couriers’ expectations. Our results indicate 
an equal alignment in the expectation of delivery time in Sri Lanka (developing country) and Germany (developed 
country). Still, the key expectation of delivery costs (payment amounts), is better aligned in Sri Lanka, signifying that 
matching expectations is easier in developing than in developed countries. Because matching expectations is easier in 
developing countries, solving the issue of critical mass, and the subsequent success of crowdsourced delivery will also 
be easier to achieve in the developing world (Rougès and Montreuil 2014).

6. Conclusion
The alignment of customers’ and curriers’ expectations for crowdsourced local delivery in Sri Lanka (developing 
country) and Germany (developed country) were investigated for six expectations. The results showed that matching 
stakeholder expectations is easier in developing than in developed countries. Out of the six expectations, three were 
better aligned in Sri Lanka (product specifications, payment amount, and payment terms) and three were equally well 
aligned (delivery time, GPS usage, and environmental impact). This paper has two main limitations. (1) Only one 
developing and one developed country were studied. Further research should verify the findings in other countries. 
(2) The participants were potential customers and couriers; thus, their actual behavior might differ from their survey
answers. Future research can study actual crowdsourced delivery stakeholders. This paper showed that crowdsourced
local delivery can be successfully implemented in the developing world. Thus, logistics and E-commerce companies
in developing countries can benefit from its findings.

Abstract 
Currently, the bakery sector has been growing exponentially, which is why most customers are more demanding and 
seek higher quality products. A large percentage of bakery companies in Peru are small or medium, most of which are 
induced to informality. Due to this, the processes have inefficiencies in there that decrease directly to the final product, 
causing deficiencies of these. That is why this research is based on reducing defective products by applying the Lean 
Manufacturing philosophy. The tools that were applied are the 5s, improvement of order and cleanliness within the 
plant; followed by this, the MRP was applied to be able to manage the stock of materials and then the MPS, to be able 
to determine the quantity of products to be produced and at what time they should be produced. Finally, the TPM 
which is responsible for each operator to maintain the machines they use. This proposal was carried out through a 
pilot test to be able to develop each tool in a bakery MYPE. In this way, the result was obtained: The reduction of 
finished products from 10% to 5%, reduction of production costs.

1. Introduction
Worldwide, bread is one of the most consumed products, obtaining approximate net sales of 6,630,209 worldwide. Its 
consumption extends to all nations of the world. 
world, Russia being the leader in the ranking with figures that reach 130 kg per capita, followed by Chile, where its 
consumption is 90 kg per capita. In addition, the bakery sector is part of the food sector, this is one of the sectors that 
provides the most employment, since 1 in 5 people work in said industry. In Peru, the baking industry has presented 
a great demand since 2020, when the pandemic began, due to the fact that bread consumption grew by 30% compared 
to 2019. In addition, according to the Institute of Economic and Social Studies (2018), the per capita consumption of 
bread in Peru is approximately 35 kilos, with a tendency to grow 6 kilos more in the coming years. Due to this great 
increase in purchases in Peru by the bakery sector, different businessmen have been investing in the creation of 
different products (different varieties of artisan breads and with healthier ingredients) to satisfy internal demand. In 
different countries, including Peru, the bakery sector has been harmed due to losses or losses of the final product, 
which is why different companies in this sector are trying to implement innovative methods that reduce losses or losses 
of the final product. to increase their profitability and be competitive in the market. The identified problem can arise 
from different reasons such as poor execution of processes, overproduction, machine failure, among others. This would 
result in an increase in expenses in the company causing a reduction in profitability. There are different investigations 
that were carried out in order to reduce losses in companies in the bakery sector, one of those was in Colombia, where 
the ""Romanello pastry shop"" generates negative effects due to downtime, raw materials and inputs, due to this it has 
The objective is to increase the utility of the company by optimizing the production area by applying different tools 
of the Lean Manufacturing philosophy (Galvis C and Ñustes E 2014). Another example is in a company in the 
production sector - production of bakery products in the district of Huaraz, where its production process was very

5.4 Validation  
The model that was proposed was validated through the implementation of a pilot test, with a duration of 1 month, 
implementing the tools, such as the 5S, where the order and cleanliness of the plant is improved, then the MRP, the 
MPS and the preventive maintenance of the machines, all this was done in the months of October and November 2022. 
Then with the data that was obtained after the implementation of the tools, we were able to calculate the proposed 
indicators, resulting in the following percentages: 
The downtime rate: This decreased from 35.26% to 10%, using the 5S methodology, this was reduced thanks to the 
implementation of cleanliness and order in the plant, with this indicator we are getting closer to our goal and a large 
amount of downtime has turned into production time. 
Out of stock: This decreased thanks to the implementation of the MRP, down from 25% to 19%, with this indicator it 
was possible to know how much raw material is needed to be able to produce the final product. 
Machine failure: This indicator decreased from 48% to 15%, thanks to the implementation of the TPM, thanks to this 
the company was able to have better productivity. 
Defective product index: This indicator managed to drop from 10% to 5%, with this the company achieved better 
profitability and had fewer economic losses. 
 
6. Conclusion  
It can be concluded that the application of Lean (5S) tools can improve the order and cleanliness of the plant. This is 
extremely important because it can improve production, reduce waste, avoid accidents, have all the tools and machines 
more organized, have documents that help feedback on the 5s philosophy. Finally, this influences the reduction of 
defective products and losses. 
In addition, it is important that the operators have knowledge of the machines that they use in order that they can do 
maintenance after using them to avoid finding continuous failures. 
Likewise, it can be concluded that the application of the MRP helped significantly to be able to plan the materials, and 
how many of them were needed and in this way not run out of stock, since this delayed the preparation of ciabatta 
bread by not Have the necessary materials to make it. 
On the other hand, it was possible to conclude that the implementation of the MPS helped significantly to reduce 
losses and waste, because it was planned how many loaves should be manufactured and at what time, and in this way 
an overproduction was not produced.

Abstract 
The purpose of this document is to provide environments with optimal lighting levels, obtain efficient energy savings 
and avoid discontent regarding the sensation of light intensity. The use of energy that keeps light energy emission 
costs linear and how to optimize it in high-demand areas such as higher education centers has become one of the most 
questioned puzzles in recent years. This is followed by the poor regulation of lighting present inside the classrooms, 
which means that the students present in the various houses of study (whether they have natural lighting during the 
day) are affected by the opaque visibility generated by the contrasts of light in the different parts of a room. The 
application of new technologies such as the management of buildings with photovoltaic panels together with 
automated sensors for the regulation of light intensity has become one of the most viable and successful solutions in 
terms of improving the comfort of students and reducing budgeted costs.

1. Introduction
The energy requirement in the 21st century is the most relevant concern among researchers working on an energy 
efficient system (Bhakre 2022) 
Over time, the problem of light regulation has been presented in various study centers, which deal with this 
inconvenience every day, mistakenly making it typical of the academic environment. This directly negatively affects 
the student performance of university students, that is why we propose through this article not only a self-sustaining 
solution but also reduce costs using lighting technology that can improve efficiency between 50 - 90% over existing 
lighting. (CENTRICA 2017) 
The rapid growth of inhabitants, technological development, and industrialization have resulted in an increase in the 
demand for energy in recent years. This demand causes a high increase in electricity production since it is a favorite 
form of energy use. Cumulatively, total global electricity demand is anticipated to grow by approximately 30% in 
2040 compared to 2015 (Elkadeem 2012). The scarcity of fossil fuels and low storage capacity force us to look for 
more viable, reliable, and clean energy options for the climate. Among renewable energy sources, solar energy is 
considered the most fascinating energy source capable of balancing this difference between electricity demand and 
generation (Pachauri 2021).  
Although the global installed capacity of solar energy has increased considerably as solar panel prices have steadily 
decreased over the last decade, the use of solar systems in buildings remains a minority (Hyvönen 2022). Then the 
maximum use of solar energy through solar panels would be an effective way to solve the dilemma of environmental 
degradation that has been gradually introduced in all aspects of society (Deng Q 2022). Thus, it will begin by capturing 
sunlight through the solar panels integrated in the building, transferring the energy to a source that will allow us to 
quantify it and store it for later distribution, regulated in the electrical circuit installed in said building. Simultaneously, 
we will obtain records of light intensity from sunlight and detect areas with less light input; in these cases, we will

5.4 Validation   
With the solar panels, we supply the necessary quantity to the luminaires to be able to regulate a system that mainly 
does not depend on a single lighting mode, likewise, the sensors, being in an environment with previously 
parameterized low lighting, send information to be able to self-regulate through the Arduino controllers. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In higher education centers it is important to consider the potential for savings with respect to energy consumption, 
which is emphasized for proper energy management. As seen in Table No. 6, for a certain number of luminaires in 
each classroom, it is considered 9, therefore, according to formulas No. 2 and 3, a favorable result of 4.68KW was 
obtained, which can be compared with the amount of power of a building of an education center resulting in 6.47 KW, 
it can be concluded that there was a saving of 1.79KW thus demonstrating an efficient energy saving. 
After having carried out the analysis of the systematization of the automated electrical circuits through an Arduino 
microcontroller device, it can be concluded that there is an efficient saving in the building. During the day there is less 
demand for energy which implies a reduction in costs. The Arduino microcontroller system had an efficient 
optimization in the control of energy use. With the use of solar panels, an energy use of 31.5 kW/h per month is 
obtained, which contributes to considerable savings in consumption expenses that arrive by receipt at the end of the 
month.

Abstract 
Professors have had academic performance problems during the pandemic associated with their learning models. 
Primarily due to lack of preparation in distance learning resulting from the suddenness of the transition. One of the 
areas most affected were STEM subjects, which had advantages in a traditional face-to-face environment. The 
pandemic presented a challenge, especially for the teaching of Operations Research. At the beginning this subject was 
taught using a model of the physical environment with some digital tools, however the performance was not as 
expected. The study focuses on demonstrating the improvement of academic performance in the Operations Research 
subject using Cooperative Project Based Learning. Method: for the research, the Cooperative PBL learning model was 
applied on measurement indicators based on the quality assurance model from ICACIT accreditation, both within a 
distance learning environment during the pandemic. Performance data were taken from one semester of traditional 
distance learning and then from 2 semesters applying Cooperative PBL by observing and measuring student outcome 
performance. After the study, performance indicators were compared and an evolution was found by applying 
Cooperative PBL. Academic performance was more promising over time, finding a difference between the first 
experience versus the later application of the model. As for quantitative results, the academic performance of the 
student's increased up to 3.00%, 100% of students passed the subject. As qualitative results, the students obtained 
recognition in university contests, generating a better intrinsic motivation, improved their critical thinking and gave 
value and meaning to their learning.

1. Introduction
As educators, professors look for ways to motivate students. Engineering professors often find students lack 
motivation due to the highly technical nature of many courses, lack of guidance to relate topics to their field of study, 
or lack of basic engineering knowledge (Ripoll et al. 2023). So as a result of these searches many ideas arise to preserve 
motivation. Some of them show that using Project Based Learning has many advantages, mainly because of the 
application of the ideas in real facts. Below we review some experiences with positive results in academic 
performance. 
Project-based learning (PjBL or PBL) could be an effective and proven alternative to traditional teaching. Professors 
could introduce PjBL in major engineering courses, and it is expected, from the positive results in several areas, that 
students will obtain better learning outcomes than those of traditional teaching (Cheng-Huan and Yong-Cih 2018). 
Beyond teaching in engineering subjects, it is also suggested that teachers involved in technology education in general, 
deepen their understanding of PBL by studying the theory of this approach, since a proper understanding of PBL is 
crucial to ensure that it is correctly applied and used in favor of educational improvement in technology. (Rauscher 
2013). In PBL, the student is the center of the teaching-learning process, the professor's role is that of a facilitator who 
presents students with resources and guidance during the process. It is more common to use PBL in a physical 
classroom environment, but during the pandemic it has been shown that in a distance or hybrid classroom environment, 
it makes a positive contribution in supporting teaching (Ceh-Varela et al. 2023).

Teaching Operations Research can be a difficult task due to students' perception that STEM subjects are complex, 
stressful, and require memorization. However, Project Based Learning (PBL or PjBL) can be an effective approach to 
enhance students' learning experience by allowing them to apply their skills and knowledge in real projects.  
PBL provides a student-centered learning environment that encourages active learning, critical thinking, problem 
solving, and collaboration. By participating in PBL, students can improve their understanding of subject matter, 
develop their communication and teamwork skills, and increase their confidence in tackling real-world problems. 
Therefore, adopting PBL in Operations Research teaching can provide a valuable opportunity for students to enhance 
their learning process and improve their academic performance. 
The research took advantage of the empathy and sensitivity generated by the pandemic to highlight the problems and 
needs of the country. The students made a diagnosis and critical analysis of their reality to later propose projects that 
improve or mitigate the problems of their region. All this with the use of mathematical models and Operations 
Research techniques. So, the research fulfilled the purpose of creating awareness and challenging the students' critical 
thinking. 
In addition to positively influencing grades, the methodology also improved student outcomes, defined as the skills, 
knowledge and behaviors that students acquire throughout their progress in an academic program. This contributes 
directly to the student's professional development and to the fulfillment of the graduate profile, beyond just improving 
grades. 
For an efficient use of a distance learning environment, it is important for teachers and students, permanent training, 
technical support and flexible schedules that would allow to improve the application of PBL. It is also necessary to 
innovate and adapt STEM education so that students continue to receive quality training even in these contexts.

Abstract 
The semi-automated cleaning-in-place (CIP) integrated cleaning technique is very common in food manufacturing 
companies. It consists of removing residues and cleaning equipment without the need to disassemble the production 
line. However, there have been problems with high pH levels after cleaning in the dairy company under study. This 
situation can represent the risk of contamination of the products with chemical agents used in cleaning and cause 
production delays. This research aims to improve the CIP process of the company. The Six Sigma methodology based 
on the DMAIC cycle was used. 70.1% of the problems related to CIP are non-compliance with the conductivity limits 
during the soda and acid stages. The data was collected directly from the software used in the company to monitor the 
activity, and the 33 cleanings carried out in the evaporator for 3 months were considered. The capacity analysis 
indicates problems of both variation and compliance with the objective, with values Cp=0.71 and Cpk=0.03 for the 
soda stage, and Cp=0.53 and Cpk=0.09 for the acid stage. Through multiple regression analysis and ANOVA, the root 
causes of the conductivity problem were found: the work shift, CIP cycle duration, temperature, outlet flow, and DSI 
pressure. The improvement proposals are mainly focused on establishing and monitoring standardized protocols for 
different tasks of the CIP, which include determining the concentration of chemical solutions, removing mud from 
caustic soda solution, and cleaning inside the tubes. It is estimated that these measures can reduce the problem by 
33.5%.

1. Introduction
Generally, the emphasis on process improvement falls on the main operations of the process. However, the analysis 
and improvement of activities that do not add value, but are necessary, such as activities related to production changes 
or equipment cleaning, often represent a way to reduce costs, improve the effectiveness of management programs and 
contribute to production goals (Hansen et al 2022), (Senvar and Akburak 2019). The case studied refers precisely to 
the cleaning process of a dairy company, whose development not only impacts the process times but also the quality 
of the product itself. 
This company produces large volumes of powdered milk with different formulas. Fat residues are generated during 
production, especially in the evaporator line, where solids are separated, and water is removed using a vacuum 
generated by air injection. During the process, a layer of soil is created when a product containing milk proteins, 
starches, and minerals accumulates on hot surfaces at high temperatures. In this way, the need arises to eliminate 
bacteria from the environment that can contaminate production lines. 
For this reason, the semi-automated cleaning-in-place (CIP) integrated cleaning technique is used, which consists of 
the action of chemical products combined with mechanical efficiency to remove residues and clean equipment without 
having to dismantle the line and clean manually (Moerman et al 2014). The CIP is based on the passage of a cleaning 
solution or a series of solutions that can eliminate residues and clean production equipment. It is a system that is used 
to clean and disinfect equipment that has been used in production.

4.5 Control Phase 
After generating improvement proposals, it is necessary to design action protocols for the use of these alternatives, 
and thus avoid failures during the of solutions, ensuring that process modifications are kept under control and the 
expected results are achieved. The response and control plan for implementing improvements (Table 3) shows who is 
responsible for evaluating the results of the implementation and includes the identification and resolution of problems 
or challenges that arise during the process.

In addition, in the case of mud removal in the soda solution, no record is kept of the activities, so a categorical control 
was implemented through the spreadsheet on the operator's console. As well as a specific form has been created for 
the inspection of the fifth effect of the evaporator, which establishes the inspection points and will make it possible to 
keep a record of the interventions on the evaporator to detect unjustified excess cleaning in time. Finally, an internal 
CIP behavior verification guide has been developed to standardize the causes of conductivity variability and ensure 
compliance with the nominal operating values. This guide seeks to reduce the variability of the process and guarantee 
that it is carried out with homogeneous quality between shifts, preserving the knowledge of the operators and 
eliminating activities that do not add value. 
5. Conclusion
The improvement proposals presented manage to explain 51.96% and 43.72% of the causes that originate the 
instability of conductivity during the acid and soda stages, respectively; the remaining percentage can be explained by 
the qualitative analysis and, in addition, by variables for which there are no records. It is estimated that approximately 
47.8% of the conductivity problem can be solved with the proposals presented, which represents about 33.5% (47.8% 
of the 70.1%) of the CIP cycle problems. These results are significant for the organization since they are related to the 
activities of the operators and the management of the critical variables during the CIP sequence and imply a 
contribution to the development of the company's strategic plan through a common knowledge base and a learning 
experience within the area.  
The use of the DMAIC methodology and the Six Sigma approach was a success as it allowed to efficiently address 
the problems related to the standardization of production, allowed to focus from the beginning on the critical variables 
from the point of view of time loss and execution errors, which is a fundamental factor in the instability of the 
conductivity that impacts the removal of organic and chemical matter. The methodology proved to be effective in 
terms of achieving in a short time some of the most important root causes of the problem presented and seeking 
customized solutions in improving the quality and efficiency of the cleaning process.

The company has partially implemented the proposals. Some of the changes made are related to the removal of sludge 
from the caustic soda tank solution. Currently, the operators have been able to keep the soda evacuations under control. 
In addition, the adjustment of the evacuation valves was regulated, and the level sensors were maintained to prevent 
overflow. As for the proposed standard operating procedure for the CIP, the soda concentration percentage and 
cleanliness ratings were updated on the operator control panel. To verify that the proposals have met the objective 
established in the definition phase, it is sufficient to compare the data before and after the implementation of the 
proposed improvements. Before the implementation of the improvements, pH values of 9.7 on average are recorded 
after a CIP process. After the implementation of the improvements, considering the data from December 2022 to April 
2023, an average pH of 8.7 was obtained, a decrease of 10.8%. Regarding the measurement of cleanliness by adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) detection, before implementing the improvements, an average of 53.5 relative light units (URL) 
was obtained after CIP cleaning. After implementing the improvements, a decrease of 56.7% was obtained, reaching 
an average value of 23.2 URL. Before process improvements were introduced, the conductivity in the soda stage 
recorded a mean of 111.8 mS and a standard deviation of 16.1 mS. Similarly, in the acid stage, a mean of 66.2 mS and 
a standard deviation of 8.4 mS was recorded. After applying the improvements in the soda stage, a mean of 108.8 mS 
and a standard deviation of 2.3 mS was recorded, and in the acid stage, a mean of 75.2 mS and a standard deviation 
of 3.3 mS was recorded, indicating a significant reduction in the variability of the data. These values demonstrate that 
the gradual implementation of the proposals presented has contributed to improving the consistency and accuracy of 
the process, which reduces the risk of possible microbial contamination due to insufficient cleanliness.

Abstract 
This paper analyzes the performance of a private nonprofit entity, called Serratec, a member of the Local Productive 
Arrangement (LPA) of Information Technology (IT) in the mountainous region in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, which 
exercises the governance of it. This article shows a single case study based on bibliographical research and 
unstructured interviews with managers of Serratec. The geographic region of this LPA involves four cities and around 
four hundred companies of software development, mostly small and medium sized. Sixty-three of those companies 
are associated with Serratec, contributing financially and benefiting from it. Besides economical results, this LPA acts 
an important social role, training and offering first job opportunities to young people or people under social 
vulnerability conditions. These cities and companies of this LPA are officially part of another productive arrangement 
of IT that involves nineteen cities in a large geographic area, including the capital of the state, which makes this 
arrangement unable to meet the demands of companies and society of the mountain region. Despite being just three 
years old and did not take part of the genesis of the LPA, Serratec inherited and reactivated a thirty-year history of 
alternating expansion and contraction phases, motivated by planned actions by the government and business 
representation bodies, promoting technology and innovation in the region. The LPA is classified as “in development” 
and the governance is called “soft”. Serratec is focused on creating conditions for companies and society to develop 
themselves in economic and social aspects with low environmental impact.

Abstract 
Companies in Bolivia and other developing countries face challenges in staying competitive in the global market. 
One issue is the lack of defined work methodologies, leading to disorganization and waste of resources. This paper 
proposes to address this problem by combining two theories, Factory Physics and the Theory of Constraints (TOC), 
to improve production processes in Bolivian manufacturing firms. Factory physics looks at relationships between 
quantities and performance, while TOC focuses on identifying and addressing constraints preventing desired 
performance levels. By combining both methodologies, we developed an improvement strategy and evaluated it 
through computational simulation models for a Bolivian furniture manufacturing firm. The results suggest that 
combining these methodologies can significantly increase productivity for Bolivian manufacturing firms.

Introduction
Globalization and the growing market needs require companies to adopt innovative techniques that allow them to 
be competitive in the face of customer demands. In Bolivia, as in other developing countries, the operational 
characteristics of industries are based mainly on improvised work. In other words, compared to developed 
countries, no defined work methodology allows them to optimize their processes or efficiently allocate 
manufacturing resources. This aspect leads, among other problems, to a lack of understanding among workers of 
the importance of basic production measures, disorganization in production planning, poor management, and 
waste of productive resources. Considering these limitations, our research aims to combine two production 
theories (Factory physics and the Theory of constraints-TOC) to improve the production processes of a 
manufacturing firm in Bolivia. In particular, Factory physics and TOC aim to enhance the performance of 
manufacturing systems by identifying and addressing the constraints limiting their efficiency and productivity. 
However, while factory physics focuses on the relationships between manufacturing quantities and the 
performance of the production process, TOC focuses on identifying and addressing the constraints preventing the 
organization from achieving its desired performance levels. Hence, combining both methodologies, we studied a 
low-productivity Bolivian firm dedicated to producing custom-made furniture. After analyzing their 
manufacturing system through factory physics and TOC, we proposed an improvement production strategy. Based 
on these analyses, we simulated the improved production system to evaluate the impact of the improved 
production strategy. Our results suggest that Bolivian manufacturing firms can significantly increase their 
productivity by combining both methodologies in their day-to-day operations.

Literature review

Factory Physics 
Factory Physics provides the essential relationships between fundamental manufacturing quantities such as 
inventory, cycle time, yield, capacity, variability, customer service, etc. (Hopp and Spearman 2011). Additionally, 
it provides a description expressed in the form of laws of the behavior of a production system. This information 
helps decide which performance measures to collect, which alternatives to evaluate, and interpret the results in a 
simulation (Standridge 2004). 
Some necessary definitions presented by Pound et al. (2014) to better understand the physics of factories are 
detailed below:

The results show that all the variables in the proposed simulated model show significantly better performance 
than the current production model. In summary, the results suggest that the proposed strategies greatly improve 
the production line's performance, decreasing the average cycle time, increasing the production rate, reducing the 
number of goods-in-process, and improving the operators' productivity. 
5. Conclusions 
This article examines the impact of implementing improvement methodologies on manufacturing systems in 
developing countries. We conducted a case study on a small furniture manufacturing company in Bolivia to 
achieve this goal, focusing on proposing ways to enhance its production system.  
We began the study by identifying the firm's characteristics and the production line under investigation, and then 
we determined the production rates of the various processes in the production line through a time study. Next, we 
formulated improvement strategies using factory physics and TOC. As factory physics provides a scientific basis 
for understanding manufacturing system performance, TOC gives us a management framework for identifying 
and managing constraints within the system. 
By calculating the production rate of each operation in the line, we identified the bottlenecks: machining, edging, 
cleaning, and selection. We formulated an improvement proposal for each of these operations to reduce the 
utilization and increase the production rates. After implementing the proposed improvements and recalculating 
the production rates, significant improvements were observed: the machining process increased its production rate 
by 48.57%, edging by 47.37%, cleaning by 16.67%, and selection by 36.36%. 
To assess the effectiveness of the proposed improvements, we constructed the production benchmarking graph 
for both the current and proposed models, this provided us with greater visibility of the system's state and the 
improvement achieved for every iteration. Furthermore, we developed two virtual simulation models to replicate 
the current production line and one incorporating the proposed improvements. Both simulations enabled us to 
extract information about the time distribution of workstations and operators and the values of the study variables: 
production rate, number of goods-in-process, and cycle time. 
In conclusion, the case study demonstrates that implementing improvement methodologies can significantly 
improve the production process of small companies in developing countries. Additionally, we proved that 
applying factory physics tools and the TOC produces positive results and provides a broader view of the system, 
allowing us to formulate better improvement plans. The proposed improvements resulted in an increase in 
throughput by 30.32%, a reduction of 36.78% in the number of products in process, and a decrease in cycle time 
by 11.65%. Steve Jobs once said: “if you define the problem correctly, you almost have the solution.”

Abstract 
The increasing adoption of environmentally-friendly technology, such as electric vehicles (EVs), is a topic of global 
interest. However, in less developed regions like Bolivia, it remains a challenge. The successful adoption of EVs in 
Bolivia depends on understanding the factors influencing consumer adoption intentions. This research aims to identify 
these factors by examining the impact of EVs' functional, non-functional and attitudinal factors on consumer adoption 
intentions in Bolivia. The study found that adoption intentions depend on factors such as gender, perceived utility, 
ease of use, perception of the environment, social influence, perceived behavioral control, emotional value, monetary 
value, and attitudes. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for marketing strategies and open the door 
for further research on the acceptance of EVs in developing countries like Bolivia. Additionally, different business 
strategies are discussed to ease electric vehicle adoption in Bolivia. The research highlights that understanding the 
factors that drive electric vehicle adoption in developing countries is essential for successfully implementing electric 
vehicles in Bolivia.

Introduction 
According to Mali et al. (2022), the global concern about the depletion of petroleum resources and its unreliable supply 
has led to a continuous search for alternative transportation technologies that are not dependent on fossil fuels. One 
promising option in the automotive market is electric vehicles (EVs). However, EV adoption in less developed 
countries is slower than in developed countries, where safety regulations, infrastructure, and EV design constantly 
improve. 
In less developed countries, various technological, infrastructural, financial, behavioral, and external barriers hinder 
the widespread adoption of EVs. In Bolivia, EVs are still in their initial stages, and policies to improve EV technology 
and infrastructure requirements are being implemented. Nevertheless, the knowledge and acceptance of alternative 
fuels are also critical factors that influence the adoption of new technologies (Jaiswal et al. 2021),  (Mali et al. 2022). 
Given the lack of specific studies on EV adoption in Bolivia, this research study aims to investigate the influence of 
perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, environmental perception, social influence, perceived behavioral control, 
emotional value, monetary value, attitude, and gender on the intention to adopt them. The study provides valuable 
theoretical and practical contributions to the EV market development in Bolivia and identifies direct relationships that 
influence the intention to adopt it. 
This research study can also serve as a reference for policymakers and industry players to understand the factors that 
affect the adoption of EVs in developing countries and to design appropriate strategies to overcome the barriers 
hindering the adoption of EVs. Ultimately, this study can contribute to promoting sustainable transportation and 
reducing dependence on fossil fuels, thereby improving the environmental and socio-economic well-being of the 
country.

Hypotheses 4 and 5 also presented statistically significant relevance (H4: β = 0.25, p < 0.01; H5: β = 0.27, p < 0.01), 
with both independent variables having a significant positive impact on EV adoption intentions. This result suggests 
that the attitude toward EVs and the emotional value respondents attach to them are essential to their adoption 
intentions. In the case of hypotheses 7 and 8, we found them to be statistically significant (H7: β = 0.22, p < 0.01; H8; 
β = 0.13, p < 0.01), suggesting that considering the opportunity and the economic capacity to own an EV, and believing 
that the social circle surrounding the respondent supports the use of the technology, will have a considerable impact 
on adoption intentions. Both results are consistent with the studies by Huang & Ge (2019) and Mohamed et al. (2018), 
which indicate that EVs will have higher adoption intentions among people who perceive them as a social symbol. 
Finally, hypothesis 9 (H9: β = 0.06, p < 0.1) suggests that women are more likely to have the intention to adopt an 
electric car. This result is consistent with the studies conducted by Sang & Bekhet (2015) and Wang et al. (2018), 
confirming that women have a higher intention to adopt EVs.  
5.3 
Quadratic terms 
Following Shalabh (2011), we used polynomial models to study whether the relationship between the dependent and 
independent variables is nonlinear. We evaluated quadratic terms to improve the proposed model to verify a nonlinear 
relationship between the study variables. This analysis allowed us to identify a positive nonlinear relationship for 
perceived usefulness. Specifically, this result suggests that EVs when a consumer does not perceive the usefulness of 
an EV, such as low vehicle range, their intentions to adopt it reduce nonlinearly up to a point. On the other hand, clear 
consumer benefits, such as an extensive number of functionality features compared to a fuel-powered vehicle, 
increases EV adoption intentions.    
We also found significant negative nonlinear relationships between emotional value, social influence, and perception 
of the environment with EV adoption intentions. This result suggests that these variables are interrelated and can 
reinforce each other. For example, a positive environmental attitude can lead to a greater emotional connection to 
EVs, which can influence social norms and create a virtuous adoption cycle. However, this virtuous adoption cycle is 
limited by the long-term costs of owning an EV, availability of charging infrastructure, limited driving range compared 
to traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles, market availability, and familiarity. Hence, nonlinearly negatively 
influencing EV adoption intentions.

Conclusion 
The study in Bolivia revealed a multiple linear regression model that explains the influence of specific functional and 
non-functional variables of electric cars on the intention to adopt this technology. The variables with the most 
significant impact on adoption intention were emotional value, social influence, perceived usefulness of the car, 
perceived behavioral control, attitude, gender, and positive environmental perception, supporting seven of the nine 
hypotheses proposed at the beginning of the study. However, we did not find statistically significant evidence to 
support hypotheses 2 and 6. Specifically, it was determined that a positive perception of usefulness, social acceptance, 
and pleasure in driving an electric car are reasons that would increase the intention to adopt the technology, which is 
in line with studies conducted by Jaiswal et al. (2021) and Schuitema et al. (2013). Similarly, we found that women 
in Bolivia would have a higher intention to adopt this technology, a finding that is consistent with other research, such 
as the one conducted by Sovacool et al. (2018). Another critical study result relates to the non-significant impact of 
the perception of an economic benefit in using an electric car. In the particular case of Bolivia, the savings represented 
by switching from a petroleum-dependent mode of transportation to an EV are less critical than in other countries 
where fuel prices are not subsidized. Similarly, it is important to note that a study by Ng et al. (2018) identifies the 
importance of the perception of an economic benefit in encouraging the adoption of an electric car. 
The study also found the significant importance of emotional value in the intention to adopt, consistent with the 
findings of a study conducted by Moons & de Pelsmacker (2012), which indicates that reflective emotions toward 
driving play an essential role in the formation of the intention to use. Marketing proposals provided by companies 
should highlight the specific attributes that electric cars have compared to conventional ones. This study identified 
that social influence and emotional value play an important role in incentivizing adoption, emphasizing the 
characteristics of self-image, social identity, and the feelings that will be achieved when using this type of car. This 
statement is consistent with the study conducted by Noppers et al. (2015), which states that sustainable innovations' 
symbolic and social influence attributes reflect the perceived outcomes of ownership and use of sustainable innovation

for self-image and social status. For example, owning an EV can indicate who or what a person is and its place in the 
social hierarchy. Moreover, we also found significant nonlinear relationships between perceived usefulness, emotional 
value, social influence, and perception of the environment with EV adoption intentions. Some limitations of the study 
are related to the surveyed sample. The study only covered the urban areas in Bolivia. Future research should expand 
sampling rural areas and other countries. Finally, as James Campbell said, ""transportation is transforming, and we 
need to get ready."" Electric cars are the future of the automotive market, and it is vital for companies that want to 
establish themselves in this market to understand the factors that drive their adoption.

Abstract 
In recent years, the agro-export sector in Peru has undergone constant changes caused by the political context, 
technological advances, among others, which affect the market share of Peruvian producers compared to other 
countries producers in this sector. This research focuses on identifying the most influential variables to determine 
future scenarios in the Peruvian agro-export sector of frozen fruits. The study analyses mango, blueberry and 
strawberry exports in Peru, in order to promote the development and growth of this sector. It has a mixed approach 
and follows Godet's prospective strategy as a research methodology. To this end, interviews were conducted with 
experts to find the most influential variables and factors were identified for the analysis of key variables using the 
Multiplicative Cross Impact Matrix Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) method and the construction of 
scenarios using the System of Cross Impact Matrices (SMIC) method. The conclusions of the study indicate that 
the variables with the greatest impact are exogenous, such as the implementation of agricultural technologies and 
adequate cold chain logistics. These results allow us to propose possible scenarios that can be used to develop 
improvement proposals for the future development of the sector.

1. Introduction
According to López (2016), the export of frozen fruit represents a business opportunity for the country, as it 
provides greater income and employment generation that contributes to improving the quality of life of the 
population. In addition, it could represent an opportunity to position these products as a country brand. 
With the export of frozen fruit, a country with a high wealth and variety of agricultural products such as Peru 
could serve as an incentive for large foreign companies to invest in new projects, generating greater development 
and a more sustainable economy as a country. According to Fresh Fruits magazine (2019), the Peruvian market 
registered a growth of up to 10% of its frozen fruit market share, which represents economic progress for the 
country in 2019. 
In order to know the competitive level of each country, it is essential to know the data on the volume of exports 
and imports of frozen fruit. As far as the Commission for the Promotion of Peru for Exports and Tourism 
(PROMPERU) is concerned, the estimated volume of exports is 28%, which generates a lower income in contrast 
to other countries. It should be noted that, in the year 2020, the volume of income has decreased considerably at 
a global level due to the circumstances of the pandemic that the world is going through. 
Regarding the issue of demand for this product, there is an export opportunity in the United States (USA) due to 
the fact that there is an increase due to a new trend and preference for frozen and preserved fruits through the 
freeze-drying process in that country; an important point why the American public prefers these products is the 
maintenance of quality in a uniform manner (Diario Gestión 2017). It is also essential to highlight that agro-
exports to the United States have grown at an average rate of 14%, thanks to the FTA with the United States 
established in 2009 (Castillo 2019). 
Furthermore, the technological factor is a key factor for the optimal export of frozen fruit. Fikiin (2003) mentions 
that the Individual Quick Freezing (IQF) method focuses on increasing the contact surface between the cooling 
medium and the food to be frozen. For this, the product must be smaller in size to be more efficient and must have 
a high-water content such as raspberries or pineapple slices; distributed in such a way that there is no contact 
between them. 
Likewise, the aim is to control the cold chain throughout the entire supply chain, from the arrival of the fruit, its 
processing, storage and transport to the different points of export. According to Cortés (2009), Peru has 89% of

After an analysis of 32 scenarios of event occurrence possibilities, the 3 most relevant scenarios will be considered 
for the research. These scenarios are the following: 
• 
Scenario 1: 
Sc. 1: 11111 
This is the initial scenario. It has a probability of occurrence of 37.2%. The values ""11111"" mean that all 
hypotheses for each variable come true in a period of 5 years, at 37.2%. By 2028, logistics and export costs 
for frozen fruit would increase by 10%, prices for the agro-export sector would increase by 10%, cold chain 
logistics would increase by 15%, the implementation of agricultural technologies would improve the 
situation in the fields by 15% and the implementation of freezing technologies in the companies of the sector 
would improve by 15%. 
• 
Scenario 32: 
Sc. 32: 00000 
It has a probability of occurrence of 28.8%. The values ""00000"" means that, in the next 5 years, at 28.8% no 
hypothesis is realized. 
• 
Scenario 17: 
Sc. 17: 01111 
It has a probability of occurrence of 6.7%. The values ""01111"" mean that the first hypothesis does not come 
true. That is, at 6.7%, the logistic and export costs of frozen fruit would not have an increase of 10% for the 
next 5 years. 
On the other side, for the scenario analysis, the sensitivity of the key variables was taken into account. Based on 
the probabilities of the key variables extracted from the software on the basis of expert opinion, the variable with 
the greatest impact on the frozen fruit agro-export sector for the proposed scenario is cold chain logistics. Godet 
(2007) argues that it is necessary to obtain the impact probabilities of the variables to check if there is a correlation 
with the influence and dependence of the variables, as long as the factors are in the proposed conditions and it is 
taken into account that there is no disturbance. The degree of incidence and dependence of the key variables of 
the study is also evaluated. 
To conclude this stage of the research, it can be deduced that the agro-export sector has the cold chain logistics 
and agricultural technology as the most influential and dependent factors, respectively. Both variables are closely 
related to the technological aspect, which is more important than the economic aspect; however, both factors are 
fundamental when analyzing the reality and context of the frozen fruit agro-export sector. 
5.4 Validation of results 
In order to carry out an adequate validation of the results obtained; it is advisable to apply the Delphi method 
because it guarantees better results in the experts' points of view. According to Godet (2007), this method consists 
of the application of interviews to predict and propose probabilities of scenarios about a sector, which in this case 
is the agro-export sector. Another very important point is the constant supervision by experts in the sector. 
For privacy reasons, each expert interviewed will be given a number, for example, experts 1, 2, 3 and 4. These 
experts are the ones who have carried out the validation for the second and third phases of the research. As 
mentioned by interviewee 1, he points out the importance of the implementation of freezing and agricultural 
technologies that allow the improvement of the organoleptic characteristics of frozen fruit. In addition, the 
interviewee argues that in the third phase, mention should be made of the conditions of the scenarios generated in 
the evaluated sector. 
 According to interviewee 2, he argues that climatic conditions are relevant because they have a high impact on 
what would become the cultivation of the analyzed fruits. In the case of the third phase, the interviewee comments 
that it is necessary to take into account the different circumstances that may affect the scenarios proposed in the 
research. Likewise, interviewee 3 admits that, thanks to his extensive experience in the sector, logistics costs are 
very important because they can have a high influence on prices in the sector. In the case of interviewee 4, he 
warns that the expectations for the agro-export sector in the reality of Peru are not entirely favorable due to the 
constant political instability that currently exists in the country. 
6. Conclusions 
Once the strategic variables were identified and validated, it was concluded that there are exogenous variables 
that are fundamental for the sector, such as the implementation of freezing and agricultural technologies, cold 
chain logistics, price variations in the sector, free trade agreements, the political situation and transport, among 
others. In addition, there is also the presence of endogenous variables such as greater availability of fresh fruit, 
costly entry barriers, variety of suppliers (raw material, inputs and technology). It should be noted that the weights 
of the variables are important for their distribution in the strategic matrix.

After having carried out the distribution of the variables in the dependence-motricity matrix (MICMAC), it was 
possible to conclude that the key variables obtained for the frozen fruit agro-export sector are exogenous in nature. 
With the validation and generation of the scenarios, it is concluded that the scenario with the highest probability

Abstract 
In recent years, data governance has become a topic of great interest for organizations since it defines power 
relationships between the actors involved in management and the socio-technical guidelines that are established in 
order to generate value for the company. organization by understanding the data that reflects evidence of performance. 
For this reason, data governance refers more than to data management, to the decisions that are made with respect to 
them, establishing those responsible for decisions, the methodology for processing, the guidelines for access, 
distribution, storage and control of data in the organization. 
Although there is no evidence that data governance adds value to organizations, data governance provides guidelines 
for exploiting the potential value of data in pursuit of organizational objectives, under the premise that good 
administration of data produces well-informed decisions, optimizes healthcare processes, and reduces the risk of 
privacy breaches 
This article presents a systematic review of recent literature on the subject in healthcare institutions in order to identify 
the main trends which are; disease diagnosis and prediction, patient relationship management, and resource 
management. The main challenges in data management in the sector were also identified, which are; technological, 
legal and business.

1. Introduction
Health service provider organizations face two major challenges that are: limited budget and high demands for medical 
care, therefore, to face these challenges and achieve high quality standards, hospitals have been increasingly aware of 
the Need for process improvement. Hospital processes can be classified into two types: clinical processes (care in 
surgery, outpatient consultation, hospitalization, emergencies, etc.) and administrative processes (customer service, 
billing, inventory, etc.). (Martin et al. 2020). The identification of opportunities for improvement in services is 
determined by the analysis of the data generated in the processes that make up the business model of hospitals, which

therefore, are not used for the improvement of processes. (Martin et al. 2020) Furthermore, collecting and synthesizing 
data from various contexts is a complex process involving many different stakeholders. This makes it difficult for 
organizations to ensure that the data they collect and combine is of high quality. The lack of quality can have serious 
consequences for organizations and society, especially when this data translates into faulty actions, which can affect 
the quality of products or services. (Clarke-Myers et al.  2019) 
 
An important challenge that organizations that provide health services have is related to the standardization of data 
and its correction, since the erroneous elimination of accurate information could have great negative impacts of great 
medical importance. (Stöger et al.  2021) 
 
Although algorithms are better able to connect data to find patterns at a higher level than humans due to the speed 
with which they process heterogeneous data sources, this would not be possible without human creativity, which plays 
a role. very important to define the linking and connection of data in order to extract knowledge. (Seddon et al. 2017) 
 
A significant barrier in the field of health at the global level is the lack of a standard for sharing clinical data, which 
has prevented effective communication between the different actors at the global level to carry out the exchange of 
interoperable electronic records for the purpose of research, diagnosis, treatment and diseases. Therefore, to break 
down this barrier it is necessary to join efforts with a global coordination that involves a variety of stakeholders in 
both the public and private sectors. (Colombo et al. 2020) 
 
4. Conclusion 
Data management and analysis in the health sector is used either with a focus on the optimization of clinical processes 
such as the diagnosis and prediction of diseases, or of an administrative nature such as customer management or 
resource management ( temporary, economic, supplies and human), whose main purpose is the transformation of the 
data collected in the care processes offered by hospitals into knowledge, for decision-making that can improve patient 
outcomes and the operational efficiency of the hospital. organization. 
 
The main challenges found for the analysis of data in the health sector are of a technological, legal and business nature, 
with the most delicate being of the legal nature when dealing with the processing of personal data and confidential 
information pertaining to the state of health of patients, which has limited research on many occasions precisely to 
preserve your privacy by restricting use and dissemination. On the technological side, large volumes of data represent 
a challenge when it is processed and stored, although technological advances have increasingly allowed data storage 
to be greater, the amount of data generated is abysmal, for Therefore, the data management cycle must be very precise 
so as not to exhaust the storage capacity with data that is not relevant or does not add greater value to the organization. 
 
The healthcare sector processes and generates a large amount of data through its normal operation. If these data are 
well managed, they can be used for the continuous improvement of both clinical and administrative processes. 
Therefore, the implementation of a data governance model promises generates added value to companies by applying 
the guidelines and policies established for the correct handling of data, which are developed through the analysis of 
the processes that make up the health service in the institution, allowing decision-making based on data that accurately 
describe the reality of the company or the state of health of a patient.

Abstract 
Retailers (companies) can leverage their collective buying power to negotiate lower prices through group buying. This 
study examines a group buying case study involving two retailers that are facing price sensitivity in the market in 
conjunction with quantity discount pricing from two suppliers who have limited capacities. To solve the problem, a 
non-linear optimization method based on Lagrangian multipliers is developed. Numerical examples are provided in 
order to test the validity of the proposed solution approach and gain insight into how the input parameters influence 
the solution.

1. Introduction
A company's procurement costs usually represent a significant portion of its expenses, and reducing these costs 
contributes directly to increased profits, especially in industries with low profit margins, such as retail(Handfield and 
Nichols 2002). Group Buying (GB) is one of the strategies for saving on procurement costs, in which different buyers 
aggregate their demands in order to enhance their negotiation power to get the most favorable price for their goods 
(Hsieh 2009). Many companies use GB, including Novation and Premier in healthcare(Weinstein 2006), Mfrall in 
manufacturing, Covinist in automotive, Polysort in plastics, and Transplace in logistics (Keskinocak and Savaşaneril 
2008). This study will examine the case of GB for a single product with two suppliers with limited capacity who offer 
quantity discount pricing, and two competing buyers (retailers), who would like to replenish that product. By applying 
a mathematical approach, a method is developed for determining the optimal order quantity to each supplier and 
determining the retail prices.
2. Literature Review
This research is related to GB because the retailers cooperate to maximize their benefit from quantity discount pricing; 
it is also relevant to the newsvendor problem because each retailer aims to maximize their profit by optimizing its 
order quantity and retail price to the consumers. The study by Chen and Roma (2011) compares group buying with 
individual buying in a two-level distribution channel with competing retailers. The researchers found that in the case 
of symmetric retailers, GB benefits them always, while in the case of asymmetric retailers, GB benefits the weaker 
player. Based on Chen and Roma (2011), (Zhou and Xie 2014) developed their model where the supplier acts as 
Stackelberg leader and is an active member. It was found that in this case, GB may be detrimental to all members of 
the supply chain, except in cases where economies of scale are present. In a newsvendor framework, (Luo and Wang 
2015) investigated the optimal discount, order quantity, and minimum order quantity with a fixed retail price for a 
single retailer and single customer. As a result of numerical results, they found that GB is more beneficial when 
demand changes in response to price changes. Karabağ and Tan (2015) examined a two-period GB supply chain, 
involving suppliers, Group Buying Organizations (GBOs), and retailers. In their model, the numerical results indicated 
that all suppliers and retailers would benefit from GB. One of the closest papers to this research is the research by 
Mohammdi and Ozelkan (2022) where they looked at a GB problem with one supplier and two competing retailers 
and proposed an analytical solution to the problem. 
As the closest model to GB to incorporate stochastic demand, the Newsvendor model can be extended to GB by 
including additional retailers (Karabağ and Tan 2015, Wang and Chen 2015). A seminal study in the field of 
newsvendor research was conducted by Petruzzi and Dada (1999), who studied the newsvendor problem under joint

6. Summary
In this research a GB problem with two competing retailers and two suppliers was studied where the suppliers have a 
limited capacity and the retailer practice GB to save on purchasing cost. The problem was split into two sub-problem; 
retailers’ problem and suppliers’ problem. For each sub-problem an analytical approach was proposed to solve the 
problem and then the two solutions were used sequentially to solve the GB problem. Finally a test case was solved 
using the proposed solution to show the applicability of the problem. One can expand this research to bigger and more 
generic GB problems or do more experimental analysis to study the effect of GB and usefulness of the developed 
solution on different problems.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential application of Airborne Fulfillment Centers (AFC) supporting 
last-mile delivery. An AFC is an airship that flies over high-density areas and uses unmanned drones to complete last-
mile delivery. Our research will focus on the viability of AFCs in high-density areas for last-mile delivery. Specifically 
analyzing the possible efficiencies and deficiencies of the model on supply chain logistics. Additionally, we will 
analyze the environmental and regulatory aspects of AFC implementation. Amazon and Walmart have patents for 
possible AFC designs, which will be evaluated. The goal of this paper will be to provide recommendations on possible 
AFC applications and overall viability in the near future.

1. Introduction
The “Place Order” button is clicked, and the multi-day wait for delivery ensues – or maybe not. Maybe, a drone zips 
by the backyard and slows onto the porch, where it gently drops the package on the doorstep. Ding! A notification 
that the package has been delivered just hours after purchase. This scenario may soon become a reality with recent 
technologies and innovations in the supply chain field. Companies and consumers alike want packages delivered faster 
and cheaper, and Airborne Fulfillment Centers may provide an answer to that problem. 
In this paper, we want to explore the potential of Airborne Fulfillment Centers (AFC) as well as their possible 
applications and limitations. The current goal of an AFC is to carry products and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to 
assist in completing last-mile deliveries. Both Amazon and Walmart are two big players in this idea, as they have both 
filed patents for similar AFC designs. And while these patents may be speculative in some sense, the hope to see an 
AFC in the air is rooted in quantitative calculations. 
Currently, there is some research on AFCs, but more needs to be done before it can conclusively be said that AFCs 
should be roaming the skies. With the growing popularity of UAVs in last-mile delivery, companies are starting to 
look at alternative ways to expand their reach. But, there are concerns with UAVs, especially surrounding their limited 
flight time and battery restrictions of about 30 minutes currently (Jeong et al. 2022). However, during descent they 
will use essentially no power until at a proper altitude close to ground level. According to the Amazon patent, an AFC 
delivery system would let customers receive their packages within 10 minutes after placing their orders (Jeong et al. 
2021). One of the main objectives for companies like Amazon and Walmart is to expand it’s last-mile delivery 
operation in order to increase its customer base. A recent study found that 25% of consumers are willing to pay a large 
shipping premium for same-day or near instant delivery (Jeong et al. 2021). AFCs would help to alleviate these 
concerns and potentially expedite the process of implementing UAVs – and other alternative methods – into the global 
supply chain.

Abstract 
In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in the demand of the plastics industry; therefore, many SMEs 
have not been able to cover their demands due to production problems, since there is a high number of unproductive 
hours in unnecessary movements, machine stoppage, and poor machinery maintenance planning, among others. The 
problem that could be identified and that occurs in most SMEs in the plastics sector is low availability due to 
unproductive times. The purpose of this article is to reduce downtime in production and consequently increase the 
OEE, since this represents a loss of money for the company, especially in the injection process.  Therefore, the idea is 
to implement the Lean Manufacturing model, which is validated with its TPM, 5s, ErgoSMED and Poka Yoke tools, 
in addition to the SLP implementation. To validate this improvement proposal, the Arena simulation software was 
used in a company in the plastics sector, since it will be possible to obtain a reduction of unproductive times by 20%, 
reduce travel times by 25%, reduce labor disorder in jobs by 15%, and in general increase availability by 12%, thus 
increasing the OEE indicator by 20%.

1. Introduction
The world production of plastics has grown significantly in recent years, reaching 8.3 billion tons to date since the 
beginning of its production of products in 1950, with China being the largest producer in the sector (Greenpeace, 
2021). For Peru, the plastic industry represents 4% of the industrial GDP and generates around 200 thousand jobs. In 
addition to this, the industry contributes 13% of taxes paid by manufacturing (Sociedad Nacional de Industrias, 2019). 
The production of plastics in Peru grew at an annual average of 4.6% between 2014 and 2019. Likewise, the industry 
demands a diversity of raw materials from the chemical sector, recycled plastics and synthetic fibers (Dirección de 
Promoción de las Exportaciones, 2021). In our country every year, companies that are more plastic are founded, but 
the most predominant are SMEs, in 2020 the number of registered companies was 2425, regardless of whether they 
manufacture plastic primarily or plastic products (Carhuavilca Bonett, 2021). 
The problem identified according to the literature relates the workload of operators, excess transfers, accident risks, 
machine maintenance, among others. All this is included in the Total Effectiveness of the Equipment, called OEE, a 
problem that was also presented in Asia, Indonesia, where a company had high downtime, having an OEE of 72.35% 
and in the investigation the main causes of the problem, through a quantitative and qualitative study (Saputro &

Based on what was simulated, an improvement in times was obtained in the plastic production processes: the availability 
of the company was 70%, with the validation and improvements of the system, this indicator improved to 86%, very 
close to of the industry standard which value is 95%. In addition, all this also leads to the improvement of the OEE.

6. Conclusions  
The purpose of this research guides us to have a greater knowledge of the context in SMEs in the plastic sector in Peru. 
The specific indicators that were improved by this study are mentioned below. 
The improvement in the plant distribution guaranteed a better movement of resources within it, and with the 
implementation of SLP the other tools were implemented in the most appropriate way because with the SLP the order 
of all the elements that are in the plant was optimized.  
 
Autonomous and planned maintenance is relevant for the optimization of processes in machines and could be evidenced 
in a significant way: the average MTTR went from 0.7 hours to 0.58, while the MTBF before had an average of 29.08 
hours, and now 51 hours.  
 
About defective products, the processing of the raw material in the machines, especially in the injected, has been 
improved through the Poka Yoke through continuous improvement devices. 
 
The application of the 5s and ErgoSMED helped to have a better production, since the spaces were better ordered, better 
distribution of the tools, the disorder of the environment low from 40% to 24%

Abstract 
Waffle House, a chain of restaurants primarily located in the southeast United States, is known for its resilience to 
hurricanes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA even has a “Waffle House Scale” assessing the 
number of Waffle House locations that are either fully operational, running a limited menu, or are closed, assessing 
both the severity of the storm and how the surrounding community is doing. To enable this resilience, Waffle House 
has strike teams of workers who can assist restaurants with both cooking and infrastructure, operations analysts 
tracking weather patterns, cookbooks that outline what can be made without grills, and teams of people facilitating 
major supply chain adjustments to ensure restaurants have the supplies needed to operate. In past storms, in addition 
to the obvious of stocking extra food, Waffle House has brought bottled water, generators, porta-potties, and even 
tankers with fuel, all to ensure that these communities will have warm food. These tactics are not unique to Waffle 
House, with Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Walmart adjusting their supply chains to help communities prepare for natural 
disasters.

1. Introduction
According to the state of Louisiana, a hurricane is a tropical storm with winds that have reached a constant speed of 
74 miles per hour or more. A hurricane can last for two or more weeks over open water and can extend inland for 
hundreds of miles. With the immense amount of wind and water that comes from these storms, there is a significant 
amount of damage that can be done to infrastructure from a hurricane. They can spawn tornadoes, create damage from 
high winds, and cause floods and even landslides. All of the effects that come from hurricanes can lead to a significant 
amount of damage and loss of life. Between 1980 and 2021, hurricanes cost the U.S. $1.1 trillion, which is about an 
average cost of $20.5 billion per event. Not only do they cause a mass amount of damage, but hurricanes have resulted 
in the most loss of life, with 6,697 deaths during this timespan (NOAA). 2021 was “the third costliest year on record,” 
with a total cost of $145B for all weather related disasters, with hurricanes making up four of the 20 most costly 
disasters (NOAA).  
From all of the damage that is done by hurricanes, the supply chain for many local businesses can be affected. The 
high winds and flooding can create long-term power outages that will affect the local stores, busy roadways can be 
flooded and blocked for long periods of time, and the high winds can make driving large trucks to become more 
difficult. Not only that, but the oncoming hurricane can cause a spike in demand for emergency resources like bottled 
water, dry ice, medical supplies, and batteries. All of these issues cause a major concern for local businesses in order 
to prepare for the storm and continue operations afterward.

148","as the government relies on the quick reactions from the command centers to provide quick relief to the areas with 
access to supplies, generators, and nearby store volunteers with their more flexible supply chain. Each company has 
its own team of experts to prepare for each type of disaster and negotiate contracts to provide flexibility in its supply 
chain for unexpected incidents to ship out at a moment’s notice.  
 
4.1.2 Managing Transportation 
After determining what is needed, getting these goods from one place to another becomes the next hurdle. Regardless 
if the transportation is done by the company or contracted out, those in the operation center need to be able to quickly 
coordinate the transportation of specific shipments.  
 
For companies that own their fleets, shifting more trucks towards these areas is very important, as hurricanes can result 
in hundreds of additional shipments, and being able to meet these stochastic jumps is critical to meet demand. If a 
company’s internal fleet is too small to meet these changes in demand, it will be unable to keep stores stocked with 
critical supplies. For large companies like Lowe’s and Walmart, while these jumps in demand are definitely impactful, 
the overall fleet is large enough to absorb this. For a smaller company with a smaller fleet, this could be problematic.  
 
Suppose transportation is being contracted out to a large freight company. In that case, the problem is no longer 
whether the fleet can absorb the spike in demand but whether the carrier can communicate and coordinate the 
company’s transportation needs. A very large transportation company will have a large enough network of drivers and 
trucks to be able to provide the extra transportation needs. Instead, the difficulty becomes making transportation 
arrangements on a tight timeline with a freight company that also serves many other businesses. For Home Depot, 
which contracts out most logistics to J.B. Hunt, this means having multiple representatives working with Home 
Depot’s team to coordinate shipments. Home Depot also works with representatives to determine when to use FTL 
and LTL to get supplies where they are needed fastest.  
 
4.1.3 Strike Teams 
In the event of a hurricane, it is important to remember that the employees of that area are under just as much duress 
as the customers that are in need of support. Employees could be dealing with anything from destroying their homes 
to even losing close friends or family.  
 
Strike Teams are essential in properly managing multiple locations over a large affected area. Usually composed of 
managers and experienced employees from unaffected areas neighboring the disaster, Strike Teams offer much-needed 
workforce and expertise. This is essential not only to relieve those employees who might be struggling with their 
duties, but to ensure that the customers are also taken care of, and facility operations can continue as close to normal 
as is appropriate. Strike Teams also play a pivotal role in ensuring that necessary supplies are delivered to the areas 
that most need them, as well as maintaining communication with operation centers to ensure that those in charge are 
able to assess the larger situation and delegate them accordingly properly. Without the Strike Teams, Operation centers 
would have no way to take immediate actions to address a constantly changing situation. 
 
4.2 Applications Outside of Retail 
Of the four major US companies discussed, Waffle House stands apart from the others because it is not a retail brand. 
As a restaurant, the chain itself actually does not stand to gain much profit-wise from its extraordinary efforts to remain 
open in the face of natural disasters. “Waffle House managers say sales volume can double or triple in the aftermath 
of a storm. The company, whose annual sales are estimated to exceed $600 million, won’t discuss the costs or benefits 
of reopening quickly after disasters. Instead, it says its strategy is more about marketing and building goodwill than 
profits.” Waffle House has adapted this goodwill into a core pillar of its brand, turning its image into one of reliability 
and community.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Hurricanes impact the areas they affect, taking down power lines, flooding streets, and destroying homes. Before a 
hurricane, being able to secure plywood and sandbags can prevent thousands of dollars of damage, and having a 
generator can save lives. Afterward, having building supplies helps people start returning their homes to normal, and 
a hot meal can elevate spirits. This would not be possible without these businesses having plans to adjust their supply 
chains to stay operational as best they can. Adopting effective strategies like having Operations Centers, effectively

Abstract 
This work presents the improvements found with the implementation of specialized valid inequalities created 
specifically to solve the rostering problem for mass transit systems, specific for small and medium size problems. The 
addition of new equations to the base mathematical model allows the analysis of a specific type of characteristics, 
time frames, driver specifications per driver and rest times. The difficulty found by solving the problem by adding the 
rostering analysis in the representation process by adding traditional equations can obstruct the automatized solution 
process, hence by adding valid inequalities generated by an extended breakdown of the computational behavior found 
in traditional solutions and new mathematical representation, were the specific analysis of certain situations and 
limitations included in actualized mathematical models for the crew scheduling problem, assures a more profound 
revision of the performance and problematic characteristics that affects the solution process. The results shown 
interesting results, regarding mathematical representation and model actualization, related with the topology and the 
size of each test system solved in this work, resulting in a new approach to find a base structure of attributes that 
represents each problem. This work uses the language C++ with the commercial solver Cplex, to ensure the optimal 
solution for small and medium size systems, searching a better computational performance, and reducing 
computational effort. The model and proposed valid inequalities are proved using test systems available in the 
specialized literature.

Abstract 
Home health care services have improved medical care allowing greater coverage of patients in their homes. In order 
to meet the demands of the service, monthly planning of caregiver’s shifts and daily routing of caregivers are 
addressed. Two optimization problems have mostly been discussed individually related with HHC: Nurse Scheduling 
problem (NSP) and Vehicle Routing. This study addresses an approach that considers the interaction of the two 
problems for an application in a case study in a private hospital, located in Bogotá, Colombia.  First a multi-objective 
mathematical model is developed for NSP using epsilon constraint. Thereafter, for solving the VRP, initially a 
mathematical model is proposed, then a Tabu Search metaheuristic is also implemented to find a solution in an 
acceptable computational time given the NP-hard complexity of the problem at hand. The impact of the proposed 
solution methods is demonstrated through the resolution of real size instances, outperforming the solutions 
implemented by the hospital´s decision planner. Obtained results show that proposed solution methods are able to 
reach near optimal solutions for both the NSP and VRP.

Abstract 
This study shows the result of the review of the maturity models for the implementation of Industry 4.0 in SMEs. The 
aim is to establish a methodological framework that analyzes the validity of said models in Mexican SMEs. This 
background review has shown that in Mexico, there is a gap in applied and validated research in local SMEs 
considering their context, so future research should focus on taking advantage of the contributions that have been 
developed in other contexts such as Europe, United States, and Asia. To develop and improve the validity and 
reliability of the results presented in these studies, through specific surveys and a statistical generalization to a broader 
sample, in the context of Mexican SMEs. These results can then be contrasted with the results obtained in other 
latitudes.

The fourth industrial revolution, commonly known as Industry 4.0, is a developing reality with global impact (Thoben 
et al. 2017). It is a cybernetic revolution (Demirbağ and Yıldırım 2021) that has brought with it a rise of intelligent 
technologies for manufacturing, such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud 
Computing, aiming at the creation of intelligent, self-regulated industrial value and interconnected (Xu et al. 2018) 
(Liebrecht et al. 2021), (Müller et al. 2018). 
Depending on the place, different terms may be used; for example, in the USA, the expression ""Smart Manufacturing"" 
is predominantly used; ""Industry 4.0"" is commonly used in Germany and Europe; ""Smart Factory"" in Korea, Asia, and 
Europe (Mittal and Khan et al. 2018). In this study, these terms are used interchangeably despite minor differences in 
their definitions. The important thing to note is that these terms are primarily intended to denote the use of new 
technologies in industries and their global manufacturing ecosystems. These terms can be described as “the marriage 
of information, technology, and human ingenuity to bring a rapid revolution in the development and application of 
manufacturing intelligence to every aspect of a business” (Romero and Stahre 2021). Those new technologies refer to 
new ways of connecting and embracing new information and operations technologies, as well as new business and 
operating models, to enable innovative revenue streams, decrease costs and increase efficiency. Aligning Industry 4.0 
initiatives with organizational strategy is a generic success factor in the implementation of Industry 4.0 (Sony and Naik 
2020). 
The findings of the literature review carried out by show that the current models and methodologies related to the 
implementation and maturity of Industry 4.0 have been designed and therefore are more suitable, helpful, and easily 
available for large companies than SMEs.  
The importance of SMEs in global economic development is well known. They represent approximately 99% of 
companies globally and employ 67% of the workforce. However, the impact on GDP is low, especially in Latin

4.2 Maturity models and Mexican SMEs and methodological proposal for future research 
The largest companies have advanced in the process of implementing efficient Industry 4.0 solutions, and SMEs risk 
not fully exploiting this potential to improve efficiency and develop their competitiveness. Even if SMEs have the 
potential to transform their manufacturing digitally, the implementation of Industry 4.0 remains a major challenge 
(Rauch et al. 2019). 
 
This study has shown the review of the most outstanding maturity models for the implementation of the principles of 
Industry 4.0 in SMEs. This importance lies in their significant contributions to supporting the adoption of Industry 4.0 
solutions in SMEs. In addition to the methodological rigor to arrive at a specific proposal, they have made applications 
to case studies that have allowed their proposals to be validated and even improved. 
 
This background review has shown that in Mexico, there is a gap in applied and validated research in local SMEs 
considering their context, so future research should focus on taking advantage of the contributions that have been 
developed in other contexts such as Europe, United States, and Asia, to develop and improve the validity and reliability 
of the results presented in these studies, through specific surveys and a statistical generalization to a broader 
population, but in the Mexican reality. These results can then be contrasted with the results obtained in other latitudes. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to continue researching and delving into these issues in order to 
propose a maturity model that adapts and truly understands the reality of Mexican SMEs. In this sense, a 
methodological route is proposed which will determine the direction of future research: 
 
1. Apply the maturity models found in Mexican SMEs in order to analyze their relevance and applicability in the 
Mexican context. 
2. Define a theoretical model for the evaluation and implementation of Mexican SME 4.0, considering the previous 
results. 
3. Validate the proposed model in a representative sample that allows quantitative analyzes that can be comparable 
to longitudinal studies. 
 
The statistical analysis tools that will be used are Factor Analysis, Correlational Analysis, and Structural Equations, 
through which relationships and weights between variables of different natures can be determined. This is one of the 
weaknesses found in the models, where no importance is established between factors or dimensions. 
 
Findings of an exploratory nature will help SMEs and their stakeholders plan for technology that can provide them 
with a long-term competitive advantage.

Abstract 
In academic institutions, e-learning platforms are widely used to manage learning contents, assessments, and student 
communication and act as a primary system for all learning needs. During Covid-19, online learning was the only 
medium of instruction used to teach students due to public health concerns. The world noticed the increased activity 
of identity theft, individual and institutional content theft, and ransom attacks in many educational institutions since 
most students were using digital technologies to learn, and information, including personal and intellectual content, 
was being shared online. E-learning platform providers often prioritize speedy delivery and deployment of learning 
solutions, which may result in inadequate attention to the security and privacy of personal information. The study aims 
to identify college students' perceptions of information security regarding online learning platforms. The global 
COVID-19 pandemic accelerated online learning methods, making it more critical for institutions to pay more 
attention to cybersecurity and ransom attacks. The results from this study will facilitate an understanding of students’ 
confidence in the learning platforms and their level of knowledge related to information security while using the 
internet. The result of this study can help e-learning platform providers with insight into perceptions of their solutions, 
which ultimately can help them to create safer and more secure solutions that protect the integrity of information 
shared.

Replacing Complex Models for Health Decision Making with 
Metamodels: Three Examples

Abstract 
Models used to inform decisions in health are often complex, data- and computation-intensive, and difficult to 
interpret. For this reason, many models developed by operations researchers to support clinical, operational, and public 
health decision making are never used by decision makers. This talk focuses on the use of metamodels – that is, a 
statistical approximation of an original model – to replace complex models for health-related decision making. We 
describe three metamodels focused, respectively, on personalization of drug treatment for schizophrenia, control of 
hepatitis C in prisons, and use of mass prophylaxis for controlling disease outbreaks. We show how machine learning 
methods can be used to develop approximate models that can perform nearly as well as the original model, but with 
fewer data requirements, less computational burden, and often greater interpretability. Although each metamodel is 
specific to the original model, these examples illustrate general principles for creating simple yet useful models to 
support health decision making. More broadly, these examples suggest ways in which complex models used to support 
decisions relating to the production and provision of manufactured products and services can in some cases be replaced 
with simpler metamodels.

Patient Monitoring over the Internet

Abstract 
With modern wearable sensor and networking technologies improving, it is becoming possible to continuously 
monitor patients remotely over the Internet, while they go about their everyday lives, and call them into the hospital 
only when their conditions deteriorate to the point where hospital intervention is needed. Such is, for example, the 
case with continuous glucose monitoring of pediatric diabetes patients. We discuss two key complementary problems 
involved in remote patient monitoring over the Internet. The first is about which wearable sensors to activate (and 
when) in order to remotely estimate the patient’s health state, given that sensors are typically battery constrained; 
activating all sensors too frequently will simply run them out of battery sooner than normal. The second is about when 
to call a patient into the hospital for medical intervention, given an observed deteriorating health state and, 
subsequently, when to discharge the patient from the hospital as the health state improves. We design and analyze two 
formal stochastic optimization models capturing the tradeoffs in these two complementary problems and glean insights 
about such novel service operations.

Abstract 
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generate a significant boost in the national economy; however, the 
permanence in the market of these companies is relatively short due to the various problems they face, among which 
the lack of access to financing stands out. The entrepreneurial ecosystem is a gear that moves the economy through 
the participation of all the actors, and, without a doubt, financing is part of this gear; therefore, the new ways of 
financing SMEs are a point of discussion since Fintech are companies that promote certain benefits for these 
businesses. Therefore, the research objective of this paper is to analyze the relationship between Fintech services and 
the financial characteristics of SMEs in two municipalities. The type of research is quantitative, diagnostic, and 
correlational. The research method is deductive. The study subjects are SMEs in the northern zone of the State of 
Mexico. The results show that the entrepreneurs of these SMEs surveyed perceive Fintech as a handy technological 
tool to finance themselves through crowdfunding platforms. In conclusion, using the Fintech tool as a financing 
alternative can be used by entrepreneurs who need help obtaining financing due to the high-interest rates they must 
pay when applying for a loan.

Small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) generated a significant boost in the national economy only in 2022;
with the generation of 1.7 million jobs, which resulted in a 3.1 percent increase in the employed population  (INEGI
2023), however, the permanence in the market of these companies is relatively short due to the various problems they
face, among which the lack of access to financing stands out since through this the same survey revealed that only

The main results show that the only variable selected for this work is the financing sources variables since there is a 
weak positive correlation when crossing with the SME variable (r=.437). Therefore, 52.2% of the SMEs surveyed 
affirm that they resort more frequently to internal financing, although 8% tend to resort to external financing, which 
agrees with what was reported by González (2014) regarding the fact that SMEs tend to finance themselves internally, 
however, few companies use the external financing, so its incidence is almost nil. However, it is observed that when 
crossing the variables of internal financing and financing sources, there is a weak positive correlation (r=.410), 
likewise for external financing and financial intermediaries, there is a weak positive correlation (r=.459), f External 
financing and financial intermediaries show a weak positive correlation (r=.459), maturity term and financial 
intermediaries show a weak positive correlation (r=.458), the utility of Fintech services and the reason why they would 
not be used present a medium negative correlation (r=-.572), crowdfunding and reasons for not using Fintech services 
show a weak positive correlation (r=.324), expiration period and Fintech utility show a weak positive correlation 
(r=.297), as reported by González (2014), Gaviria et al. (2018), Britto and Castro (2019), Pérez (2020) to name a few. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Fintech financial services detect the use of this technological tool as a source of financing in SMEs in two 
municipalities in the north of the State of Mexico. Therefore, the following is concluded:Of the SMEs surveyed, they 
resort to internal financing, while they only resort to external financing. Internal financing comes from the partners' 
contributions and the retention of profits. External financing comes from requests for lines of credit, informal 
financing, and bank loans. The financing is used for working capital and investment and covering contingencies and 
expenses.SMEs turn to financial intermediaries such as Fintech companies, lenders, and cooperatives of the SMEs 
surveyed if they would use financial services from Fintech companies and are not interested in going to a Fintech to 
obtain financial services. SMEs would not use Fintech services because they need to learn how they work, do not trust 
them, and prefer traditional banking.For   SMEs, it is beneficial to hire financial services through Fintech companies. 
At the same time, it is not very useful to request financial services from these companies, and Fintech companies do 
not represent any use.SMEs find it more interesting to contract Fintech services due to the flexibility of this business 
model, while others are interested in cost reduction,   accessibility, and time savings. Of course, SMEs would request

financing through crowdfunding platforms while he has no interest in obtaining financing for their company through 
this service offered by Fintech companies. 
In this sense, by analyzing the perspective of SME entrepreneurs in the northern area of the State of Mexico regarding 
Fintech services, it is determined that they are willing to contract Fintech services and request financing through 
crowdfunding platforms. , since it is helpful for them to hire these financial services due to the accessibility, flexibility, 
cost reduction, and time savings that it implies. However, there still needs to be more trust and knowledge about using 
these financial services that use technology to provide users with a different experience. In this way, the proposed 
hypothesis is accepted because, through the analysis of the perspective of SME entrepreneurs in the northern zone of 
the State of Mexico regarding Fintech services, it was possible to detect the use of this technological tool as a source 
alternative for financing. Precisely, it is estimated that the data obtained regarding the use of Fintech services as a 
financing alternative is because in Mexico, entrepreneurs have difficulties obtaining financing due to the high-interest 
rates they must pay when applying for a loan (Entrepreneur, 2019), which is why some entrepreneurs of the SMEs 
surveyed expressed that it is beneficial for them to use Fintech services due to how these services are contracted 
through electronic platforms. Likewise, the use of Fintech services does not represent a problem for entrepreneurs 
since one of the characteristics of entrepreneurs is precisely their ability to assess risks and accept new challenges 
(Santillán et al. 2015), so using platforms Crowdfunding is a new challenge that they are willing to accept to keep 
their companies at the forefront of technology and thus be able to more easily access the financial resources they need 
to continue growing and expanding their business.

Abstract 
This work intends to combine technical analysis and the K-means clustering algorithm in portfolio selection. To 
choose the appropriate number of clusters, this study suggested the Elbow Method and Multi-Criteria Index Model 
from the most reputable Index, including Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin. We formed the 
clusters using the annual average risk data for the years 2019 and 2020, and we evaluated the stocks based on the 
technical analysis used by investors, such as Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) and Hybrid 
MACD with Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA). In the empirical experiment, we used the mean-variance 
portfolio optimization model to solve the risk minimization issue on a subset of the companies' shares in order to 
choose the most effective portfolio. The Philippine Stock Market lists 234 and 239 businesses for 2019 and 2020, 
respectively. All simulations were carried out using the MATLAB environment platform. The COVID-19 condition 
is significantly riskier than the pre-COVID-19 condition, according to the results. The MACD approach dominates 
the MACD-ALMA strategy in terms of the number of assets with a positive annual rate of return.

1. Introduction
Online trading is one of the options available to institutional and ordinary investors in the Philippines in the current 
era of swift technology advancement. Although they are not all the same and there are certain differences between 
institutional investors and non-institutional, or retail, investors, these sorts of investors can still profit from the 
internet trading platform. The term ""institutional investor"" refers to an organization or individual that transacts large 
amounts of assets in order to qualify for preferential dealing and lower costs. Institutional investors do not invest 
their own money; rather, they invest other people's money on their behalf. On the other side, a retail investor is an 
individual or amateur investor who purchases and trades stocks through brokerage houses. They frequently make 
investments for themselves in brokerage or retirement accounts. During COVID-19, there was a noticeable increase 
in the number of retail investors using online stock trading platforms in the Philippines. ranging from a novice 
investor who needs help creating an investing strategy to an experienced investor who can use an internet trading 
platform to carry out a strategy.

According to Table 6 (2019 data), the RP  at global minimal risk ranges for the MACD (12,26,9), MACD (4,22,3), 
MACD-ALMA (12,26,9), and MACD-ALMA (4,22,3), respectively, are 23.84%–101.99%, 35.96%–133.54%, 
2.40%–7.35%, and 3.00%–27.56%. The ranges are 21.91%-107.43%, 17.19%-104.10%, 10.09%-34.32%, and 
3.29%-129.90%, according to Table 7 (2020 data). According to the results of the MACD strategy, the E3 portfolio 
has the highest RP (101.99% and 133.54%) for the 2019 data, while MC7 dominates MACD (12,26,9) and MC4 for 
MACD (4,22,3) for the 2020 data. When using 2020 data, MC9 with MACD-ALMA (4,22,3) outperforms other 
techniques. This demonstrates how the MACD-ALMA approach was able to manage a high-risk market situation 
while still producing the highest possible return. In addition, clustering using the Elbow Method outperforms well in 
pre-COVID-19 settings (2019 data) while the Multi-criteria Index Model performs well in COVID-19 conditions 
(2020 data) 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Works 
A major global health disaster has been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global pandemic COVID-19 has a 
significant negative impact on the Philippine stock market. In the damaged market, retail investors are still looking 
for outstanding investments. In this study, the potential portfolio based on annual average risk is determined using 
the K-means clustering technique. The Elbow Method and the suggested Multi-criteria Index Model were used to 
estimate the ideal cluster size. The Silhouette Score, the Calinski-Harabasz Score, and the Davie-Bouldin Score 
were merged in the Multi-criteria Index Model. In all, 234 assets/companies for 2019 (pre-COVID-19 situation) and 
239 assets/companies for 2020 (during COVID-19 condition) were utilised. The performance of MACD and the 
hybrid method (MACD-ALMA) under both typical and COVID-19 settings was compared and examined. The 
findings indicate that the COVID-19 condition is considerably riskier than the pre-COVID-19 state. The COVID-19 
has a significant impact on the Philippine market environment. The MACD approach outperforms the MACD-
ALMA strategy in terms of assets with positive annual rates of return. No matter how many assets have a positive 
annual rate of return, the MACD performs well in the pre-COVID-19 state while the MACD-ALMA performs well 
in the COVID-19 condition. The outcomes further demonstrate that utilizing the MACD in the pre-COVID-19 
condition and MACD-ALMA in the COVID-19 condition, the maximum expected return (RP) may be attained. The 
MACD-ALMA exhibits a benefit in high-risk market circumstances and can also offer maximal RP. In pre-COVID-
19 settings, the Elbow Method performs well for clustering, while the Multi-criteria Index Model well suited during-
COVID-19 conditions. 
 
Theoretical Contribution 
In order to use the proposed Multi-criteria Index Model and the K-means Algorithm to determine the ideal number 
of clusters, this work contributes theoretically to the body of literature already in existence. In cluster determination, 
it includes the three well-known model criteria. This Multi-criteria Index model has the highest predicted return, 
making it ideal for the COVID-19 condition in 2020. The clustering technique will assist the investor in deciding 
which portfolio to concentrate on in order to achieve the best return. In addition, compared to the traditional MACD 
(12, 26,9) during-COVID-19 situation (2020), where the market is at high risk, the hybrid MACD-ALMA with a 
window of (12,26,9) and (4,22,3) (investment strategy) offers a benefit. since the buying/selling transaction points 
were more than the usual approach (See Figure 1)

For practitioners, decision-makers, and managers, this paper has ramifications. They can create a cluster trading 
strategy that enables them to establish a diversified portfolio using technical analysis with the use of K-means and 
technical analysis. This article outlines a step-by-step process for evaluating, clustering, choosing, and optimizing 
portfolios while taking risk and return into account. Engineers, managers, institutional investors, and retail investors 
can all use this method to choose the best stock portfolios and will profit from diversity in this study since it will 
help to shield an investor's portfolio from systematic risk, which could expose the portfolio to losses. 
Limitations and Future Works 
In order to verify and validate the effectiveness of the suggested strategy, this research restricts the evaluation in 
using prior data. Future study may address return estimation using forecasting tools and approaches. Other 
evolutionary optimization techniques can be used in conjunction with Holt-Winters, neural networks, or other 
forecasting methodologies.

Abstract 
One important choice in manufacturing and service systems is the Facility Layout Problem (FLP). The proper 
architecture of the equipment is essential for achieving optimal use. Having the best facility configuration is crucial 
for lowering product costs and enhancing the efficiency of the manufacturing process. In order to reduce the cost of 
material handling, this research suggests a genetic approach for resolving the equal area facility layout problem. To 
answer the problem of facility layout, numerous optimizations and heuristic algorithms have been presented and 
published in the literature. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is assessed and contrasted with other 
methods. The proposed method's main benefit over competing strategies is that GA's coding is straightforward and it 
produces the majority of the optimal value compared to other approaches.

1. Introduction
The layout of facilities or departments is a facility layout problem (FLP) on manufacturing and service sectors are 
experiencing all throughout in their process operation. In order to minimize a specific objective function, it can be 
expressed as the ideal assignment of a facilities to b locations. Facility layout planning is an essential step in the 
production process and has a significant impact on the company's profitability. The majority of the total operational 
cost is made up of total material handling expenses, which are calculated by adding up unit material flow, unit 
material handling expense, and the rectilinear distance between the centroids of locations between pieces of 
equipment. 
According to Tompkins and White (1996) material handling costs account for 20% to 50% of overall operating 
costs, total production costs range from 10% to 80%, and a well-designed facility can save material handling costs 
by 10% to 30%. Therefore, a small reduction in material handling costs can help to reduce overall operating costs.

Conclusion and Future works 
 
In this study, we created a method  and modify the  genetic algorithm process to reduce overall material handling 
expenses. Multipoint Swapped cross over was applied. In a comparison utilizing a benchmark numerical example, 
the proposed method is significantly more effective than the other methods in the literature. The solution 
demonstrates that an increase in generation has a positive impact on objective value more so than an increase in 
individual. Despite being simple, the coding is robust and produces good results. 
Genetic Algorithm perform better compared to other solutions for several reasons. First, the performance of the GA 
might be significantly impacted by the standards of the initial population. Finding high-quality solutions is more 
likely if the initial population is good because it can serve as a better starting point for the search process, Second, 
the genetic operators used, such as swapped-crossover and mutation, can have an impact on how well the GA 
performs. The population's variety can be preserved and early convergence to less-than-ideal solutions can be 
avoided with the proper application of crossover and mutation operators. Third,  the process utilized to choose 
individuals for the next generation may also have an effect on the standard of the solutions produced. Better 
outcomes may result from appropriate selection processes that give the fittest candidates priority. And Lastly, the 
fitness function's design, which is how the solutions are evaluated, is also very important. The goals of the facility 
layout problem should be accurately captured by a well-designed fitness function, which should also give an 
indication of how effectively each solution is working. Regarding the proposed technique of swapped crossover and 
mutation in the context of facility layout problem using genetic algorithms, The effectiveness of the swapped 
crossover and mutation technique may vary depending on the specific instance of the facility layout problem being 
solved. It may work well for some instances but not for others. The technique may not scale well to larger problem 
instances with a higher number of facilities or constraints. There is a risk of the algorithm converging prematurely to 
suboptimal solutions due to the limited exploration of the search space. The technique may require a large number of 
fitness function evaluations and can become computationally expensive for complex problems. The effectiveness of 
the swapped crossover and mutation technique may also depend on the selection of appropriate crossover and 
mutation operators, which can be challenging and require domain expertise. The methodology outlined in this 
research may be applied and tested in future work to a wide number of facilities and case studies from the real world 
applications considering multiple constraints and objectives.

Abstract 
Distribution utilities are under pressure to attain high efficiency and minimize system loss and because to the current 
trend in distribution regulation, distribution transformer relocation, network splitting, incorporating distributed 
generation and altering secondary line and service drop size, are some of the different ways to reduce secondary 
system loss (DG). The genetic algorithm is used in this study to properly position and size rooftop solar photovoltaic 
(PV) generation systems, minimizing secondary system loss (GA). The technique relies on a single, ideal installation 
to prevent voltage profile issues. This study uses thorough modeling to take into consideration various loads, client 
attributes, and solar PV generation systems. Power flow based forward and backward sweep methodology was 
employed because of the unique characteristics of low voltage secondary distribution network. To demonstrate the 
robustness of the suggested strategy, secondary line features were used.

1. Introduction
The distribution network's power flow, voltage profile, efficiency, reliability, stability and protection, and are all 
significantly impacted by the existence of distributed generation (DG). The conventional distribution network is 
challenged, particularly if the DG is deployed at the low voltage secondary distribution network. Customers 
routinely request the interconnection of these systems from utilities and distribution firms as dispersed generating 
grows in popularity. Residential, commercial, and industrial power system users all heavily rely on distributed 
generation. A different source of power is offered by DG whereas a rooftop solar PV generation system is an 
example of DG that can be connected to the utility's service through its low voltage secondary distribution network. 
The influence on maintaining regular system operation could be negative when more solar PV generation systems 
are deployed. 
Gibson et al., (2007) introduced a novel approach for characterizing the transformer secondary circuit archetypes 
and the load characterization based on customer use of the electric secondary distribution system. The results of the 
proposed method's implementation in a pilot region of the neighborhood electric utility confirm its efficacy. 
Waseem (2008) created a computer program using Microsoft Excel to calculate the energy losses in the service 
drops, secondary lines, and transformers for all transformer secondary circuits in the pilot region; as a result, the 
circuits with the highest losses are highlighted for more investigation. On the subject of the economic analysis and 
design of secondary circuits, the applications of the suggested secondary distribution model and load 
characterization presented are also covered. The effects of installing dispersed generation on distribution network 
functioning, including voltage profile, electrical losses, dependability, and harmonics, were studied in the literature 
(Alam et al. 2009), (Abdul Kadir et al. 2011), (Sun and Zhang 2009). The effects of distributed generating on

6. Conclusion and Future works 
Using a genetic algorithm, we created a way in this paper to reduce secondary system loss (GA). To prevent voltage 
profile issues, the procedure is based on optimal single installation. Test examples based on actual secondary 
distribution network features are used to show how resilient the suggested solution is. The answer demonstrates that 
by dispersing the ideal single installation capacity to various system nodes, it is possible to achieve a considerably 
more optimal reduction of secondary system loss and voltage profile. Future research may use the approach outlined 
in this paper by accurately modeling the solar PV inverter based on real-world geographic characteristics, 
considering factors like temperature, irradiance, shading, position, tilt angle, etc. To reduce annual energy loss, time-
varying loads may be adopted.

Abstract 
Inventory management becomes more important as companies grow; therefore, it is important to improve its internal 
processes by seeking efficient storage methods. The processes were analyzed using problem diagnosis tools and it was 
observed that more than 15% of the total orders are delayed, and more than 80% are due to the fact that there is no 
specific location of the products in the warehouse. Under this problem, the implementation of the ABC methodology 
is proposed, which allowed dividing the large number of products that the company sells into families and classifying 
them into groups A, B and C. Subsequently, the entire company warehouse was divided into zones. Arena software 
was used to compare the results between the current situation and the improvement implemented. According to the 
results obtained, it was shown that from a reduction in picking times of 20% or more, the improvements implemented 
would be significant, and so it was. A reduction in picking time of approximately 33% was achieved, and late orders 
per day decreased on average from [5.03 ± 1.5] to [1.83 ± 0.56] orders.

1. Introduction
The ABC methodology is a categorization technique based on the Pareto Principle to determine which items should 
be prioritized in a company's inventory management, allowing the company to separate stock-keeping units (SKUs) 
into three groups (Jemelka et al. 2016) starting with group A. This is the most important group because it usually 
occupies 20% of inventories and has the highest turnover; therefore, it is of strategic importance. These are the 
products in which the company has invested the largest budget and usually generate 80% of revenue, so it is a priority 
to place them in low areas, with direct and easy access. Secondly, group B, comprises a medium turnover range and 
usually represents, in quantity, 30% of inventories, so they are located in areas of intermediate height whose access is 
not as direct as in the positions occupied by products A, and their evolution must be monitored, since they can become 
type A products. In third and last place, group C, are the most numerous, accounting for 50% of the stored references. 
However, they are also the least demanded and it is advisable to monitor them so that they do not end up forming an 
obsolete inventory with no turnover, so they occupy the highest or least accessible areas (Hanafi et al. 2019). 
It is also known that minimizing order preparation time leads to a considerable increase in productivity and cost 
reduction, which is why it must be taken into account, in order to achieve an optimal service system, the uninterrupted 
delivery of goods in the process of cargo movement. For example, proper bulk inventory management can consume 
only 50% of the total order preparation time.(Nosko et al. 2020). Because the ABC methodology solves one of the

Figure 14. Comparison between current and improvement scenario 
 
When comparing the scenarios, it is observed that, after the improvement, the indicator of orders delayed during the 
day is within 30% and 40%; therefore, the proposed improvement has had significant results. The percentage of 
picking time reduction that the improvement had was determined and it is close to 33%. 
 
The proposed location of the items of each family group in the warehouses reduced the time in which an order is 
attended Before the improvement, operators took approximately 30 to 140 seconds to prepare a box; now, by applying 
the improvement and assigning a specific location to each family group, it is easier and faster to find them. Regarding 
the time an order remains from the time it enters to the time it leaves, before, a single order could be handled in [93.18 
± 19.68] minutes; after the relocation of the families of items, this indicator decreased to [46.98 ± 6.15] minutes. As 
for the time in queue per order, before several orders were accumulated because of the time it took to attend one, it 
was between [33.01 ± 12.47] minutes; after the proposal this improves considerably to [6.39 ± 2.87] minutes 
approximately. About the percentage utilization of storekeepers, this used to be [86.14 ± 4.84] %, but by reducing the 
order picking time, they even have periods in which they do not have orders to attend to, so their utilization has been 
reduced to [65.44 ± 4.15] %. 
 
In addition, the indicator for the number of orders in backlog per day decreased from [5.03 ± 1.5] orders to [1.83 ± 
0.56] orders. As evaluated, it is from a reduction of 20% to more that the application of the ABC methodology was 
relevant to the research; and with the result obtained by the implementation, it was possible to reach a reduction of 
approximately 33%. The achievement of this results can be also supported in the study conducted by the authors 
Gutiérrez et. al. (2019) who reduced order preparation times in a national distribution center, where they propose a 
mathematical model of linear programming for the relocation of SKUs in the warehouse and, therefore, reduce picking 
times. As a result, they obtained time savings for the three types of orders they handle, being 10.33% for type 3, 8.81% 
for type 4 and 6.69% for type 2. Other benefits obtained were savings in operating costs, organization in the warehouse, 
reduction of staff movements and impact on workers' health. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results obtained after simulating the order preparation process in the warehouse of a company located in the 
province of Barranca, show that it is possible to obtain reductions in the delay of orders by relocating the family groups 
according to criteria based on the ABC methodology. In addition, the reduction in the time in which an order is 
attended from [93.18 ± 19.68] minutes to [46.98 ± 6.15] minutes increases the productivity of the work performed in 
the warehouse, which allows a greater number of orders to be covered. This was achieved thanks to the fact that each 
family of items was analyzed and placed, according to rotation criteria, in groups A, B and C; of which the first group

was assigned to warehouse 1 and the rest to warehouse 2, with the objective of minimizing distances by optimizing 
routes and thus reducing the picking time taken by the storekeepers. Finally, the picking time indicator was reduced 
by approximately 33% with respect to the initial warehouse scenario. This value is considered significant because it 
exceeded the 20% that was determined as the minimum value in the statistical tests, and managed to reduce the average 
number of late orders per day from [5.03 ± 1.5] orders to [1.83 ± 0.56] orders. 
In this research article, the current scenario of the picking process has been compared with different possible scenarios 
to determine if the impact of the proposed improvement would be relevant or not. The application of the ABC 
methodology has a positive impact on the reduction of picking times; and, therefore, also on other indicators. In this 
case, the increase in productivity in the picking process has had a positive impact on the reduction of the main indicator 
of this scientific article, which is the number of orders delayed during the day.

Abstract 
The Turkish defense industry shines out as an extremely significant example in terms of the history of the Republic, 
the understanding of the concept of the defense industry and its relations with other fields, and of the future of the 
defense concept. However, in order to sustain this success, it is necessary to use emerging technologies in the 
defense industry. The use of additive manufacturing technologies, which is one of these technologies, in the defense 
industry is one of Türkiye’s country policies. It is also a fact that the success of this policy depends on the 
presentation of correct technology roadmapping. In this paper, a stakeholder analysis is conducted to provide a 
technology roadmapping for the integration of additive manufacturing in the defense industry. Several stakeholders 
including defense industry companies experienced universities and additive manufacturing institutions are 
considered. In order to contribute to the technology roadmap, the interests, influences, and powers of the 
stakeholders are trying to be determined. The results to be obtained at the end of the study will be shared with policy 
developers.

1. Introduction
The defense industry consists of a commercial industry involved in research and development, engineering, 
production and service of military equipment, equipment and facilities. The defense industry is also very important 
for countries to live in security and prosperity. Every country that has determined its own borders is obliged to 
protect these borders in order to ensure its own continuity. In order to protect these borders, countries must be able 
to acquire the necessary tools for all these situations, as well as an army consisting of manpower, which can directly 
protect or use the necessary equipment (Ozsoy et al. 2019). 
In the defense industry sector, it is difficult to manufacture parts using existing technologies. The production 
problem of these difficult parts can be solved by the additive manufacturing (AD) approaches. Parts with complex 
geometry that cannot be produced with the traditional method can be manufactured by the AD method. In addition, 
more functional, lighter and more economical parts are produced with the AD method (Madan et al. 2021). 
With the project titled ""New Generation 3D Printer Manufacturing Technologies Platform"", and supported by 
TÜBİTAK, it is aimed to develop new generation additive manufacturing technologies and produce high value-
added aviation/defense industry products. Within the scope of this project, it is necessary to prepare a technological 
roadmap and reach the goal. Stakeholder analysis is required to prepare a technological roadmap. 
Stakeholder analysis helps to identify individuals, groups and organizations that will be directly or indirectly 
affected by the results of the project, both positively and negatively. It also enables us to analyze the relations of the 
identified stakeholders, especially with the project; it also helps us to anticipate conflicts that may arise between 
different stakeholders. In this project, different stakeholders (TUSAŞ, ASELSAN, ROKETSAN, TEI, GAZİ 
University EKTAM, Ermaksan, TÜBİTAK MAM, Erzurum Technical University, Sabancı University) were 
considered.

6. What are your technological infrastructures? What is your level of technology to contribute to the project? 
7. Are there any different issues that you cooperate with other stakeholders within the scope of the project? If so, 
what are they? There are many stakeholders involved in the project. If you have had the opportunity to work with 
these stakeholders, what kind of results did you achieve, and which are these stakeholders? 
8. Can you rate your interest in the planning, execution, and outputs of the project (Assess the relevance of the 
outputs of the project to the sector you serve)? Not: 0 to Very High: 5. 
 
The answers to these question groups should be examined in detail. Stakeholders are placed in the interest/power 
matrix according to the evaluated answers. Stakeholders are classified according to those who have power over the 
work and those who have an interest in the work. 
 
4. Results and Discussion  
Two experts from nine stakeholders (three universities and six companies) were asked the questions mentioned in 
the previous section and the opinions of 18 experts in total were collected through Google forms. The textual 
opinions obtained were compiled, summarized and interpreted to fill the matrix in Figure 1. The results are shown in 
Figure 2. According to the obtained opinions, GAZİ University EKTAM is both the most powerful and the most 
interested stakeholder. While TEI, ROKETSAN, TÜBİTAK MAM locate at power side, Sabancı University and 
Erzurum Technical University have interest to the project.

5. Conclusion  
The defense industry provides the production of defense equipment and services deemed necessary for the security 
of the countries. The use of AD technologies in the production of defense equipment not only facilitates the 
production of difficult and complex parts, but also enables more economical production. 
 
In this project, the role and participation of stakeholders was analyzed while preparing a technology roadmap for the 
defense industry. While preparing the technology roadmap, it was examined in three separate phases: Preliminary 
activity, Development of the Technology Roadmap and Follow-up Activity. Questions were prepared to determine 
the interests and interests of the stakeholders (TUSAŞ, ASELSAN, ROKETSAN, TEI, GAZİ University EKTAM, 
Ermaksan, TÜBİTAK MAM, Erzurum Technical University, Sabancı University) that were determined during the 
stakeholder analysis. A power/interest matrix has been prepared to prioritize stakeholders. 
 
In future studies, the effects of stakeholders' views on the strategies of the defense industry can be examined and the 
prioritization of strategies can be studied.

Abstract 
To aid medical professionals in their timely and accurate diagnoses of patients, powerful and accurate diagnostic tools 
are required. Image processing software tools improve the quality and accuracy of x-ray images used in medical 
diagnoses. The scope of this project encompasses the design and use of X-hance, an interface created to enhance image 
quality issues of various medical images which are taken from the MedPix R- CME Cases Database. These images 
have some problems, such as blurriness, undefined or unclear edges, unfair distribution of contrast between bone and 
tissue structure, darkness, and bad tonal rendering. Our main purpose is to process these problematic images using 
different functionalities of X-hance. These functionalities are one push button to upload the unprocessed image, 
another push button to preprocess the image, and three sliders that can be used for adjusting signal equalization, tonal 
rendering, and display compensation. The advantage of using sliders in an interface is enabling the user to correct 
images by manually controlling the parameters of the algorithm when moving the sliders left or right and stopping at 
the desired position to obtain an improved quality of the x-ray image.

Abstract 
The goal of this project is to develop a robotic prototype capable of swimming at high speeds, which can be used for 
rescue and/or ocean research. We would separate its specific characteristics by attempting to use to a large extent the 
shape of the movement of the sailfish, which has as a characteristic the shape of a dart when moving at high-speed 
thanks also to its lack of scales that make its coefficient of friction with water is minimal. Located in the belly of the 
robotic prototype, which also has degrees of freedom in its neck and fins, this will allow it to go up and down without 
using human force, adding comfort and stability when performing deep-water rescue operations.

Abstract 
Contemplating the problem generated by the low capacity of the construction sector in the houses located 
in the high Andean zone of Peru and the regulation of buildings, in this article we will seek to improve and 
optimize the execution processes in the highlands of Peru applying the methodologies of work of LEAN 
CONSTRUCTION-BIM METHODOLOGY for small and medium-sized companies, thus applying tools 
that generate value to the activities in the execution process, thus eliminating all types of material loss, 
seeking to reduce costs, increasing the collaboration of the work team and reducing the execution time of 
the work and the prevention of accidents, a study stage of the problem will be carried out, thus applying a 
small modeling with BIM where we will propose a minimum and adequate standard for constructions in 
the highlands of Peru and applying a standard of LOOK AHEAD for optimal progress of the work. It is 
known that in our country there are areas that are far from the main city, so they are excluded from 
everything. To talk about the types of construction forms and structures is to mention the precariousness 
that they have and where people are affected.

1. Introduction
Currently, work planning in Peru is a fact that should involve all groups of the various disciplines involved 
in construction. However, good organization is not always carried out; this is the case in places like Peru's 
High Andean zone, where there are few trained personnel to use new tools like lean construction and BIM. 
In this way, in the absence of planning, it is not possible to improve the effectiveness and productivity of 
the work. (Gomez 2021) 
There will always be inconveniences and setbacks that prevent carrying out the activities that have been 
established. That is why possible fortuitous events must be foreseen and anticipated using appropriate tools 
such as programming software and work planning systems. 
In the case of the high Andean areas, it is very common that there are delays in the work due to the lack of 
material, because the majority of them are brought from the capital and the climate of the high Andean 
areas is unpredictable This type of delay would be avoided if it were detected by a good system and planned 
for when each activity started. (Corahua 2017), as shown in Table 1.

5. Conclusion 
• 
BIM and Lean construction methodologies are used to improve and perfect processes, specifically 
the construction process. 
• 
With the data collected in the productivity curve, it can be determined based on profits that the daily 
value in period 5 is where the peak value of the graph is observed, which means that that is where a 
process is optimized. 
• 
It is very important to be able to carry out different projects in which the continuous improvement 
of the day-to-day is prioritized in the different production processes. In addition, a good environment 
for total integration must be created.

•
When applying the methodologies, the area must be taken into account, which in our case was the
high Andean area, because each area of our country is different, whether due to climate, type of soil,
materials, etc. For this reason, the process will vary depending on the area.
•
After applying these methodologies, the most fundamental thing is being able to provide people
with a quality, safe, and accessible product. As a result, the investigation found that using a
methodology reduces production costs by 30%.

Abstract 
It is necessary to carry out soil mechanics and resistance studies before deciding to carry out a civil construction in 
the Lima area, considering that it has geomorphological features of cliffs approximately 40 meters high next to the 
sea, since Lima is located in an area of high seismic risk, considering that the project is located 1 km from the Pacific 
Ocean and this could cause failure due to settlement due to a high sulfate content. Due to the lack of geotechnical 
studies in the sector, activities were carried out such as: data collection of the geological structure, tours in the study 
area and a test pit was made at a depth of 3 meters to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil. , 
as well as the resistance parameters through the direct shear test, which later allows us to find the behavior of the soil 
such as: moisture content, specific gravity and granulometry. Through these parameters, graphs and tables were made 
in which the structure and behavior of the soil in a coastal city is observed in more detail.

Exploring the Effects of Footwear against Fall Incidents 
Amongst Older Adults: A Review for Design Enhancement

Abstract 
Slip, trip, and fall (STF) incidents annually affect millions of people of all ages and genders, but older adults are more 
susceptible. In the elder population, general physical decline, age-related illnesses, mobility issues, and foot 
deformities play a major role and further aggravate the risk and severity of STFs. Although abundant factors have 
been found in the literature, shoes seem to be a major contributor to STF incidents. Shoes should not only support the 
basic functions of retaining stability and preventing foot aches but shield the foot and provide the necessary traction 
features needed to guard against possible STFs. However, the safety issues of shoes for elderly fall prevention have 
not been systematically explored. Thus, this study meticulously reviews the current research and practices on the 
effects of footwear on elderly fall prevention. The literature review was based on five main search keywords: footwear 
properties, older adults, slips, trips, and falls through the databases of Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, 
MEDLINE, ResearchGate, and PubMed to find answers for the main questions on footwear effects against the elderly 
falls. The review was also focused on footwear design features: fit, fixation, heel height, collar height, slip resistance, 
and sole/insole hardness. It is expected that findings from this review study may contribute to the present literature by 
offering suggestions for optimal footwear choices to promote comfort, stability, and safety against STF incidents in 
older adults’ daily lives.

1. Introduction
Populations around the world are aging rapidly due to a continuous rise in average life expectancy. It is predicted that 
persons aged 65 years and older will make up 12% of the global populace by 2030 and 16.7% by 2050 (He et al. 
2016). Concurrently, the labor force across various industries is aging, with this trend projected to continue over the 
upcoming years (Truxillo et al. 2015). Owing to such demographic and societal changes, the burden of injuries and 
costs associated with elderly STF incidents has become more evident. 
Approximately 37.3 million fall incidents that require medical care are reported annually (World Health Organization 
2022). By the World Health Organization (2022), fall incidents are the second most prominent cause of unintentional 
injury deaths following road traffic injuries. Although different age groups are prone to experiencing STFs, older 
people are more susceptible, and tend to face the highest risk of serious injuries and fatalities (World Health 
Organization 2022). More than 30% of adults above the age of 65 suffer a fall each year, with a recurrence in 50% of 
those cases (Tinetti et al. 1988). As the rate of fall injury hospitalizations increases (Watson and Mitchell 2011), it 
becomes more economically taxing for patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems (Alekna et al. 2015), (Heinrich et 
al. 2010). STFs can also lead to detrimental psychological effects, whereby 60% of older adults with a fall history 
report a fear of falls, which in turn can have an adverse effect on their functionality and lifestyle (Hill et al. 2010).  
2. Background Information
2.1 Physical Factors
Frailty in those over 65 is high (between 6.9% and 8.4%) and continues to increase with age (Fried et al. 2001),
(Garcia-Garcia et al. 2011). Older adults are more likely to suffer from musculoskeletal disorders that decrease their
functionality and mobility (Cuevas-Trisan 2019). Their feet are prone to exhibit lower sensitivity (Machado et al.

Abstract 
In this paper, a new probability distribution called Generalized Continuous Uniform Distribution (GCUD) is 
presented, which is based on the standard uniform distribution. In this new distribution, a parameter is introduced in 
the probability density function that is associated with the power of the values of the random variable. The shape 
properties, the higher order moments, the moment generating function, the failure and survival function, and the model 
that simulates the GCUD are derived. In addition, this approach allows us to generalize the Generalized Uniform 
Distribution of Jayakumar and Sankaran (2019), which generates another new distribution that we call 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(J−S). To 
demonstrate the proposed model’s potential, we used a set of real data related to the Covid-19 pandemic was obtained, 
which were adjusted to the new distribution 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(J−S). The maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the 
parameter estimators applying the maxLik package in R language. The results show that the new model is more 
flexible and appropriate than other models already known in the literature.

1. Introduction
In recent years, various researchers have proposed different generalizations of new distribution functions of 
continuous random variables to model, more broadly, different behaviors related to survival analysis, for example, the 
lifespan of a computer or system. Also, these new models have allowed the analysis and study of the failure function 
(or risk) to describe the reliability of devices subject to use and deterioration. Additionally, these extended distributions 
provide greater flexibility for modeling various real-life problems (Almuqrin 2023; Mazen Nassar et al. 2018; Torabi 
et al. 2018). 
This research work follows the approach presented in the seminal article by Marshall and Olkin (1997), which was 
continued by other authors such as Alshangiti et al. (2014); Jayakumar and Sankaran (2016); Jose and Krishna (2011), 
where they presented the results of the Marshall–Olkin extended uniform distribution, giving different approaches to 
it to generate a new family of the uniform distribution. The uniform distribution, defined on the interval [0, 1], is 
closely related to the rest of the distribution functions. From our perspective, we propose a new family of the uniform 
distribution function, based on a novel presentation of what we call the Powered Mean. Additionally, the work of 
Jayakumar and Sankaran (2019) was generalized, where the failure and survival functions are relevant. 
The document is structured as follows. In the second section, the general conditions of the new Generalized 
Continuous Uniform Distribution family are defined and discussed, and some interesting properties of the GCUD are 
also shown. In the third section, the GCUD approach is used to generalize the work of Jayakumar and Sankaran (2019). 
In the last section, a real data set is used to fit the proposed model and we empirically demonstrate that our model is 
more appropriate than other competing models. Finally, the conclusions are presented.

5. Conclusion 
This article introduced a new family of the standard uniform distribution with three parameters, called Generalized 
Continuous Uniform Distribution (GCUD). The method used in this proposal incorporates a parameter 𝒌𝒌 to the power 
of the values of the continuous random variable, which favors a greater diversity of the probability density and failure 
functions. Also, some properties are derived from the new distribution. On the other hand, this approach allowed us 
to generalize the model presented by Jayakumar and Sankaran (2016), which allowed us to generate a new family of 
distributions, called 𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮(𝐉𝐉−𝐒𝐒), which presents excellent flexibility in the cumulative distribution function due to the 
presence of the parameter 𝒌𝒌. To demonstrate the above, a set of real data related to Covid-19 was adjusted, the maxLik 
package in R-language was used to find the parameter estimators. The results obtained show that the 𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮(𝐉𝐉−𝐒𝐒). It 
can be considered as a valid alternative to known distributions, such as the Weibull, Exponential Weibull, New 
Marshall-Olkin Weibull distributions, among others, with the advantage that it provides the flexibility of working with 
the parameter in the values of the variable. random.

Abstract 
Retailers face a series of problems due to the increase in electronic competition and the change in consumer habits 
caused by the global situation. Given this, a possible solution is the application of Lean tools, methodologies, and 
initiatives which also allow for generating competitive advantages in retail businesses. Therefore, this document aims 
to carry out a Systematic Literature Review, considering 32 articles selected from the Scopus and Web of Science, 
focused on the application of Lean methodologies and tools in the retail sector. The results of the research show 
agreement with previous articles and lead to the conclusion that the use of Lean tools in the retail sector is possible 
and recommendable since it brings various benefits to companies.

Improvement tools, retail, Lean, continuous improvement. 
1. Introduction
The retail sector refers to the fraction of the economy that sells products or services directly to end consumers (Qin 
and Liu 2021). Due to the high generation of jobs and the promotion of consumption that characterize this industry, 
the retail trade, highlighting the retail food market, contributes significantly to the economic development of a country 
(Cortés et al. 2022). For instance, in 2019, the retail sector accounted for approximately 43% of the global Gross 
Domestic Product (Vodafone Bussiness 2019). 
In the past few years, there has been an intense increase in competition for retailers with the rise of electronic 
commerce or e-commerce (Qin and Liu 2021), aside from the changes in consumption habits caused by the COVID-
19 pandemic. Likewise, with the expansion of electronic commerce and the growth of digital sales channels, the 
operations of modern retailers are becoming more complicated and need more orderly organization models to carry 
out their operations in the best way and generate operational efficiencies. Continuous improvement and other Lean 
tools are alternative solutions to the problems and needs of the retail sector (Frei et al. 2022; Marques et al. 2022; Qin 
and Liu 2021), as well as a source of competitiveness to generate advantages and operational efficiencies (Negrão et 
al. 2020; Saudi et al. 2019).

271",,"case studies that help to know the application of Lean and its results in a real case. Moreover, it was found that the 
effectiveness of Lean implementation increases with the combination of different Lean tools if these complement each 
other.  
Finally, some gaps identified in the present investigation could serve as a starting point for future investigations. First, 
exploring e-commerce or digital platforms in retail development. Although e-commerce grew considerably with the 
pandemic of COVID-19, at the time of the writing of this article, the current information in this area still needs to be 
made available to make an SLR of this subject; therefore, this paper proposes the topic as possible future research. In 
turn, there needs to be more information regarding the use of improvement tools for the optimization of spaces or 
redistribution, being an important issue related to storage and inventory, which could be solved by the implementation 
of various Lean tools such as 5S or seven wastes. Our research has limitations since it only focuses on applying Lean 
tools (excluding other improvement methods such as space optimization or space redesigning methodologies) and the 
search for articles is only made using Scopus and Web Of Science (excluding other databases) limiting the articles 
available for analysis.

Abstract 
Mining companies that carry out material movement activities for the heap leaching process maintain a constant 
sequence of operations. Properly scheduling these operations is crucial to reduce operating costs. The scheduling of 
mining activities can be modeled as a flow shop problem. The efficient scheduling of mine operations must be 
continuously monitored to ensure positive impacts. Implementing technologies such as Digital Twin for process 
planning and control in industries such as mining is now expected. This paper presents a methodology based on an 
asynchronous team of metaheuristics to solve the flow shop problem resulting from a case study of a Chilean mining 
company. Tabu search algorithms were used as team members. An asynchronous team was selected because it 
maximizes the use of computational resources, thus providing the Digital Twin with a sophisticated optimization 
algorithm for operation scheduling. The performance of the asynchronous team was validated by benchmarking 
against the best works published in the literature. A set of classical instances was used due to the company's limitations 
in using their information. As future work, it is expected to contrast the improvements in planning and control of 
mining activities with the asynchronous team embedded in the Digital Twin.

1. Introduction
Within the mining industry, leach material movement activities maintain a constant sequence of operations; the 
essential factors in scheduling these operations are operating time, resource availability and utilization, and production 
costs. Optimal scheduling of operations (production scheduling) can help ensure that this process can respond quickly 
to changes in work demand and meet assigned targets (Peña et al. 2022). The scheduling of material movement and 
site preparation activities in the heap leaching process is crucial to ensure the efficiency and profitability of the 
production process. Several factors must be considered to carry out this task, such as the availability of machinery, 
the type of ore to be processed, and weather conditions (Checya 2015). Within mines, it is essential to have rigorous 
planning to ensure that resources are available at the right time and in the necessary quantity (Barrios 2020). 
Efficient scheduling must be accompanied by prior and continuous control of operations; the use of technologies for 
control and monitoring in the mining sector has increased, given the significant savings obtained and their ability to

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
For instances with just five machines, results were obtained between 5 seconds to 180 seconds, these values are 
dependent on the number of jobs used in the application. For instances with a larger number of machines, results were 
obtained between 15 seconds to 600 seconds, also depending on the number of jobs. These values are acceptable for 
the case study, considering that the programming is performed manually in a time between 3 to 5 hours (and it cannot 
embed into the Digital Twin), thus, with the ATTS it would be efficiently improving the obtaining of a result in a quite 
reasonable time. These results are good enough to embed the ATTS into the Digital Twin. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The architecture consists of 24 threads (16 Performance Threads and 8 Efficient Threads). Figure 3 shows the level 
of thread usage, so that the ATTS takes full advantage of the computational resources of the equipment that holds the 
Digital Twin. Furthermore, in the execution stage of the algorithm, there were no failures, corroborating the robustness 
that, in theory, the asynchronous team should have.

6. Conclusion 
A methodology using an asynchronous team architecture to solve the flow shop scheduling problem was developed 
for the case study of a Chilean mining company. The asynchronous team architecture of tabu search algorithms 
achieved the most optimums reported for classical instances in the literature, proving its excellent performance for 
cases with few machines.  
  
The distribution of the asynchronous team across multiple processors allows us to exploit the computational 
architecture hosted by the Digital Twin. No singularities evidence the robustness of the asynchronous team in the 
execution. 
  
The simultaneity and randomness of the tabu search algorithm offer the possibility to explore a much larger solution 
space, increasing the probabilities of the metaheuristic to find excellent quality solutions. 
 
As future work, it is expected to contrast the improvements in the planning and control of material movement activities 
for the heap leaching process of the Chilean company with the asynchronous team integrated into the Digital Twin.

Abstract 
In this paper, if artificial intelligence affects the company's management decision-making process, it assists human 
decision-making in the decision-making process (shareholders' meeting, audit, information disclosure, etc.), and 
artificial intelligence makes its own decisions. (Artificial intelligence makes management decisions without human 
intervention in the board of directors, etc.)  
First of all, at the general shareholders' meeting, which can be said to help in decision-making, it uses artificial 
intelligence to convene a general meeting of shareholders, publicize the general meeting of shareholders, and perform 
accounting audits and work audits rather than playing a key role in decision-making. Therefore, a more comprehensive 
and immediate audit is possible through real-time feedback of information through artificial intelligence. Artificial 
intelligence can also be used as a tool for corporate information disclosure. 
On the other hand, artificial intelligence can learn on its own and play a key role in the management decision-making 
process of the board of directors because it can make altruistic and quick judgments if the input information is fair. 
Since the board of directors is an important decision-making body for the company, artificial intelligence can provide 
advice during the company's management decision-making process, unlike tasks such as shareholders' meetings or 
audits, and furthermore, provide advice when making important company decisions. Can on their own without human 
intervention. In addition, if management decision-making using artificial intelligence or artificial intelligence itself is 
wrong, legal problem solving can be a problem. And as our society develops, those problems will only get bigger and 
bigger. 
In short, legal proceedings become very important when companies are harmed by AI-enabled decision-making. 
However, it is difficult to find the cause of errors caused by artificial intelligence due to the black box problem of 
artificial intelligence. Therefore, as a countermeasure against these errors, it has recently been suggested that the cause 
of errors caused by artificial intelligence can be identified by introducing and operating white box AI and XAI 
(Explainable Artificial Intelligence). And with these solutions, it is said that it is possible to determine whether there 
was a serious negligence in the decision-making using artificial intelligence, whether there was no conflict of interest, 
and whether the decision-making was carried out according to the principles. 
However, as many physicists and mechanists claim, the development of artificial intelligence has outpaced all human 
intelligence combined. 
In this paper, we assume various cases that may occur when companies apply and operate slightly strong artificial 
intelligence (level 4) that can be fully recognized in reality, and there are legal and institutional problems to solve 
them. And I'm looking for a solution for that.

discuss these issues, first, prior to the introduction of artificial intelligence (step 4) directors, whether the company 
bears the obligation to use artificial intelligence directors or whether the business judgment principle applies if not 
used, and next, the introduction of artificial intelligence After that, if the judgment is based on the judgment or advice 
of artificial intelligence, how to apply the principle of business judgment when a decision is made against the judgment 
or advice of artificial intelligence, and finally, strong artificial intelligence (step 5), artificial intelligence It is necessary 
to classify and examine the case of the problem that arises when it is applied instead of the role of all human board 
members. 
 
2.2.5.3 Firm decision-making involving strong artificial intelligence (step 5) 
In Korea, the number of directors must, in principle, be three or more (Commercial Act, Article 383, Paragraph 1), 
but companies with a total capital of less than KRW 1 billion may have one or two directors. (Commercial Act, Article 
383, Paragraph 1) In the case of a small stock company with one or two directors, the function of the board of directors 
is basically replaced by the general meeting of shareholders, and each director or representative director represents 
the company and, in certain cases, assumes the functions of the board of directors. 
 
2.2.5.3.1 AI Directors and Changes in Governance Structure 
2.2.5.3.1.1 Changes in governance structure 
In an era of AI-dominated corporate governance, these traditional boards of directors will become unnecessary. First, 
when AI allows robots to replicate the benefits of human group decision-making and outperform both the speed and 
quality of decisions made by human organizations, multi-member boards are likely to disappear. Perhaps these 
developments will prompt policymakers to introduce legal reforms around board composition and appointments, 
enabling companies to move towards AI boards and management. 
 
2.2.5.3.1.2 Integrated board 
With the advent of strong artificial intelligence robots, we should expect the size of the board to shrink. In my opinion, 
it is expected to be a board of directors that is more advanced than the current stage, and can be called a 'fusion board' 
composed of humans and artificial intelligence. For this reason, characteristics such as combined knowledge and skills, 
advantages of group decision-making, diversity and independence, which could only be provided by collectives 
before, are expressed in artificial intelligence robots through the coding function of algorithms. Here, it means that 
the diversity of the directors who make up the current collective board of directors is merged and provided as a single 
entity called ""AIDirector"". These artificially intelligent robots could still be chosen and “assigned” by shareholders 
and could be switched to other, better software systems on a regular basis. The benefits of collective boards are 
considered useful because they improve access to information, mitigate the effects of limited rationality, discourage 
decision-making based on personal bias, allow directors to monitor each other and reduce agency costs within the 
board; It can help delegate responsibilities and alleviate excessive workload on individual directors. Next, we assume 
that the director of the artificial intelligence robot works 24 hours a day, efficiently processes available information, 
calls and utilizes this information almost immediately, may execute functions without personally demanding 
compensation, and operates selflessly. This eliminates the need for multiple directors to monitor each other to alleviate 
conflicts in human behavior. 
 
3. Conclusion 
Artificial intelligence will become an indispensable part of company management. Prior to the development and 
introduction of artificial intelligence, we will first understand this artificial intelligence and identify the good and bad 
points that may appear in the future, and the introduction of a legal system accordingly will be urgent. In other words, 
we are at a stage where we have to judge what role this artificial intelligence will play, what results the work performed 
by artificial intelligence will have and how it will affect the world, and how these things will be done within the 
framework of the law.  
Whether to recognize artificial intelligence as a legal personality will be judged according to what role artificial 
intelligence will play and influence in the human world in the future. This is because the issue of granting legal 
personality is a matter of artificial expansion of the historically changing, variable and relative concept of personality, 
and is only a matter of securing legitimacy from the point of view of legal policy. 
If artificial intelligence technology is further developed and it is possible to create algorithms and select input values 
by itself, such artificial intelligence (step 45) may recognize these laws and regulations on its own and take measures 
against violations in advance so that the law cannot be applied. . In addition, if the opponent of artificial intelligence 
is also a robot of artificial intelligence, there is a possibility that unity can occur with each other, so there is room for 
301","Proceedings of the 4th South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

problems, and it is a very professional area to objectively judge the injustice of these problems, and artificial 
intelligence also has such problems. There is also the possibility of recognizing the difficult problem of objective 
judgment in advance and applying it after judging it in decision-making. Moreover, it is difficult to determine whether 
or not human beings have violated the duty of care for negligence with respect to artificial intelligence due to the 
problem of black boxing. 
When a company conducts independent management using artificial intelligence (step 5), decision-making is made 
by algorithm commands according to the rules and information of the given company, and artificial intelligence (step 
5), which makes decision-making based on a predetermined algorithm, is a human director. Unlike directors, there 
can be no serious negligence unless there is a particular error in the production process or data, and since artificial 
intelligence does not have liability property, there is no conflict of interest, and there can be no intentional neglect. 
Violation is also difficult to apply. If the problem of black boxing, where the decision-making process is unknown, is 
transparently managed through white box AI or explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the party concerned will 
inform the artificial intelligence director about damages to the company or a third party caused by the current director's 
wrong judgment. You may not be able to claim damages. Therefore, if such AI management is applied, the current 
system of business judgment principles can become an outdated policy. 
This thesis is expected to provide implications for introducing various cases that may occur when such artificial 
intelligence is applied and operated in a company and introduce related laws and systems.

Abstract 
Currently, in the fishery industry, production of traditional fisheries is decreasing due to ① limitations in fish 
resources, ② pollution of the marine environment, ③ illegal overfishing, and ④ weakening of the foundation due 
to hollowing out and aging of fishing villages. As a result, aquaculture has been proposed as an alternative to traditional 
fishing methods. 
In this paper, by identifying the factors that people interested in existing conventional fish farming, new fishermen 
who want to enter aquaculture, and fishermen who want to retire in a fishing village to spend their old age accepting 
AI-based smart aquaculture systems, It was intended to derive the direction of advancement and contribute to the 
development of the aquaculture industry. 
To this end, the following three research questions were set. First, a research model was established to identify the 
acceptance intention of the artificial intelligence-based smart aquaculture system. Second, factors that directly or 
indirectly affect the acceptance intention of the AI-based smart farm system were set as independent variables and 
parameters, and measurement items were derived. Third, in order to find out the effect of demographic characteristics 
such as education, career, and age on acceptance intention, the study was conducted focusing on the relationship 
between independent and dependent variables. 
The study was conducted in 5 stages. In the first stage, the overall direction of the thesis, such as the purpose of the 
study and the procedure for the factors affecting the acceptance intention of the AI-based smart farm system, was 
presented. 
In the second step, previous studies were divided into three areas and analyzed. ① Analysis of preceding studies on 
the definition, configuration and theoretical background of AI-based smart aquaculture systems, environmental 
characteristics in terms of policy, economy, society, and technology through PEST technique, and future development 
direction, ② Acceptance intention of preceding studies related to artificial intelligence services Analysis ③ Prior to 
constructing the research model, previous research models such as TAM, UTAUT, IS Success Model, and ServQual 
were analyzed to derive measurement items such as independent variables, parameters, and dependent variables. 
In the third step, the research model construction step, a model was constructed to conduct this study, hypotheses were 
established, and operational definitions and measurement items for direct, indirect, and moderating effects were 
derived. 
In the 4th stage of empirical analysis, a questionnaire was constructed based on the measurement items derived in 
advance, and a total of 457 people were surveyed from December 2020 to February 2021. Using SPSS 26 and AMOS 
26, the influence of parameters and the moderating effect of demographic characteristics were analyzed as follows. 
Checked the result. ① Reliability, expertise, and availability were analyzed to have a positive (+) effect on perceived 
ease. Along with this, responsiveness and security had a positive effect on usability. Investment value and social 
influence had a positive (+) effect on acceptance intention. ② Reliability-perceived ease-acceptance-intention path, 
expertise-perceived ease-acceptance-intention path, and usability-perceived ease-perceived usefulness path had a 
complete mediating effect, and the perceived ease-acceptance-intention path It was analyzed that there was a partial

based administrative services, 58% experienced simple information utilization and 28% experienced information 
inquiry and civil petition handling. However, the actual frequency of use per week is 0.9 times, and by analyzing this, 
it can be seen that there are many people who have experienced a small number of times, but those who use it 
continuously are few. Based on this, the analysis by experience of recognition technology was divided into a group 
that used artificial intelligence services as a test experience and a group that consistently experienced services, and 
those who used AI services less than 10 times (196 people) and those who used AI services more than 11 times (219 
people) After grouping, comparative analysis was conducted. As a result of analysis by age for each hypothetical path, 
as shown in Table 2, the SP ⟶ PE path of H5 and the IV ⟶ AI path of H11 were adopted between groups with less 
than 10 AI service experiences and 11 or more AI service experiences, respectively. Contrary to this, it is judged that 
there is a significant difference between the two groups.

On the other hand, for the H1, H2, H3, H4, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H12, H13, H14, H15, H16, H17 routes, there was 
no difference in adoption results between groups with less than 10 AI service experiences and 11 or more AI service 
experiences. It is not visible and is judged to be of no significance. 
 
3. Conclusion 
In the 2000s, the fast-growing consumption of fishery products, global warming, marine pollution, illegal overfishing, 
and other traditional methods of producing fishery products, such as fishing, showed limitations. It became. As a 
result, the production method of aquatic products is being transformed from the existing fishing industry to the 
aquaculture industry. In particular, the 4th industrial revolution technology, which has recently been spreading across 
all industries, has promoted convergence in the aquaculture industry, and accordingly, the smart aquaculture system 
has emerged and entered the diffusion phase. However, there are matters to be considered in terms of policy, economy, 
society, and technology for the full-fledged spread and development of smart aquaculture systems. 
First, in terms of policy, it is necessary to improve the relevant legal system surrounding the aquaculture industry. 
Accordingly, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries enacted the negative-based Aquaculture Industry 
Development Act in 2019 to overcome the limitations of the positive-based Fisheries Act, and accordingly, individuals 
or companies that have promoted the aquaculture industry so far can do business in a realistic and non-restrictive legal 
system environment. The basis for the full-fledged development of the aquaculture industry was formed. In particular, 
for special aquaculture species that require large-scale capital, it is possible to restrict the participation of large 
companies, making it possible to scale and commercialize the smart aquaculture industry. 
Second, in terms of economy, 40% of total seafood consumption is imported from abroad according to the annual per 
capita consumption of seafood in Korea, which is currently ranked first in the world. Accordingly, a public-private 
joint project to create a large-scale smart aquaculture cluster complex of 20,000 pyeong is being promoted in three

the legal system direction of the smart aquaculture industry, standardization, and technology development. In addition, 
considering the limitations of this study centered on the acceptance intention from the user side, a new study 
considering the future trend-based technology research related to smart forms such as digital twins and underwater 
robots or continuous use intentions for experts in the future Research activities and R&D projects should be pursued 
to derive a direction and continue to develop the AI-based smart aquaculture industry.

Abstract 
The Indonesian government continues to launch a battery-based electric vehicle acceleration program. It is estimated 
that there will be significant growth in sales of battery-based electric vehicle (EVB). The battery costs about 40% of 
the cost of an electric vehicle (EV). With a battery life of around 8 to 10 years, EV batteries will intensively face the 
retirement stage and have an impact on the environment in the form of unused battery waste. The target number of 
EVs in Indonesia in 2030 will reach 2 million units; hence, it is estimated that there will be 0.718 million tons of 
batteries that need to be recycled by 2040. There is a need for a study on the reverse logistics of the electric vehicle 
and electric vehicle battery industries. The causal loop diagram was utilized to examine the potential dynamics existing 
in the reverse logistics system of EV. The results could provide support the capacity planning of EVB remanufacturing 
as required by the potential regulation in the future.

1. Introduction
Along with the growth of world population, the need for energy continues to increase. Concurring to the International 
Energy Agency projections, global energy consumption will increment by 45% until 2030 or a normal increase of 
1.6% each year. Approximately 80% of the global energy needs are provided from nonrenewable fuel source (IEA 
2022). Indonesia is one of the countries with a continuously increasing amount of energy consumption, driven by the 
rate of population growth and GDP. Fuel consumption and emissions have received serious attention from the 
stakeholders in recent decades. The problems faced are global temperature change, climate change and side effects on 
human health (Sukarno et al. 2016). The transportation sector is expected to contribute 82% to the overall increment 
in liquid fuel use in 2035. Over the past three years, this segment has reached the highest yearly development 
percentage of 6.45% compared to other segments. 30% consumption comes from the transportation sector (Sukarno 
et al., 2016). Meanwhile in Indonesia more than 40% of the total energy consumption comes from the transportation 
sector (Ministry of Energy 2021). 
At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in 2021, the Indonesian government has outlined 
ambitions to accelerate the deployment achieving carbon neutral by 2060. It has already built this into the government's 
strategic plan to accommodate sustainability standards that can be realized with low carbon emission vehicles, electric 
cars and their components (Ministry of Industry 2018). The indicated target is to achieve 2 million electric cars in 
2030. This number would relate to around 9% of the particular stocks, compared to well beneath 0.1% in 2021. To

5. Conclusion 
This study succeeded in explaining a conceptual model for the EV reverse logistics process and relates to the 
remanufacturing and collection capacity of EVB in Indonesia. The model is created by recognizing the factors included 
and distinguishing the connections between interrelated factors within the system boundaries. This conceptualization 
model was created utilizing system diagrams and causal loop diagram (CLD) that are the premises of the system 
dynamic path. A system diagram is developed for a comprehensive understanding of EV reverse logistics related to 
the problem owner's goals from the problem owner, the stakeholders involved, input systems, processes, and outputs, 
as well as intervention policies that can affect the output of the conceptual model.  
 
Current study is limited to the build and develop of a reverse logistics EV conceptual model in Indonesia, while 
mathematical approach for this model have not been carried out. Subsequent research will consider a stock and flow 
diagram (SFD) refer to the conceptual model that has been developed and validated. Stock and flow diagrams can be 
utilized quantitatively and qualitatively to analyze the outcome of government interventions on the EV battery 
remanufacturing and collection systems.

Abstract 
The study proposed an inventory policy for its products with the highest demand based on the analysis of the 
application of three planning techniques, which were the silver Meal method, the minimum unit cost method and the 
EOQ. In addition, forecasting techniques were applied with a bimonthly historical data from the sales record that 
helped identify the products with the highest demand according to the ABC classification. The methodology carried 
out in a grocery store in Peru found that the demand behavior differed in each product; so, the standard deviation was 
analyzed. Then, the application of the three planning techniques was compared where a similarity in the frequency of 
orders and quantity between the Silver Meal and MCU was observed; on the other hand, the EOQ functioned as a 
preliminary step to identify a reorder point.

1. Introduction
Warehouses or grocery stores are establishments that offer household products, perishable products, among others. In 
other words, it is a business that is dedicated to the retail marketing of necessities; in which food and beverages 
predominate (Ley Peruana No. 30877, 2018). 
In Peru, wineries or grocery stores represent a very important item in the retail commercial sector. In 2017, 87.6% of 
formal MSMEs came from trade and services activity in Peru (Ministerio de Producción 2020). In addition, the 
Association of Winemakers of Peru indicates that in 2020 1489 formal and informal wineries were opened in 
Metropolitan Lima and Callao; of which, 75% were opened in the health crisis, unfortunately 45% of these had to 
close due to a low sale of their merchandise (RPP Redacción 2020). 
Scholars argue that small and medium-sized enterprises make decisions according to the criteria of a single person, 
usually intuitively (Pekuri et al. 2014). In this situation, the supply chain of an MSE can present stock breakages or

6. Conclusion  
The inventory policy was satisfactorily constructed; when applying the techniques presented after applying the 
techniques such as Silver Meal or the MCU in an annual range or in a time ballast, the minimum cost indicator can 
extend or reduce the number of days, this can happen on holidays or holidays, also, the EOQ technique indicates a 
high volume of sales,  which prevents accumulating the purchase quantity since there is a storage limit due to the 
space of the warehouse, in conclusion, the inventory policy must be carried out with a monthly or quarterly anticipation 
for the products sold. Likewise, the application of an inventory policy generates a growth potential in the volume of 
sales, being the cost of this method accessible to the winemakers, in addition, the methodology used in the study can 
be replicated, to carry out the inventory policy of all products and build a systematized network for food inventory.

Abstract 
Flooding in the city of DKI Jakarta is a problem that always comes every year and always causes huge financial losses 
for its residents. Not only that, but the problem of flooding in the capital city of Jakarta has also tarnished the good 
image of the city of Jakarta as the center of the government sector. The cause of flooding in the capital city of Jakarta 
has many factors, one of which is the relatively high rainfall rate in the city of Jakarta. The second thing that causes 
flooding in Jakarta is land subsidence in DKI Jakarta and one of the causes of land subsidence in DKI Jakarta is 
excessive groundwater extraction. Because most Jakarta residents use groundwater as a source of clean water, 
groundwater extraction occurs on a large scale and is almost uncontrollable. As a result of this massive groundwater 
extraction, the groundwater system bears a very heavy burden. One method to achieve alternative clean water 
resources is rainwater harvesting. Therefore, if there is a need for alternative water resources, they can help restore 
groundwater naturally and can help reduce land subsidence in DKI Jakarta. However, the community's interest in 
harvesting rainwater is very small. Therefore, it is necessary to know what factors influence the community's 
acceptance of rainwater harvesting. Primary data processing uses the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method to 
determine the relationship between the acceptance factors of rainwater harvesting.

1. Introduction
Each year, the city of Jakarta experiences devastating floods that cause great harm to its inhabitants and tarnish the 
capital's reputation as the center of government in Indonesia. The primary factor contributing to the flooding is the 
high level of rainfall, which is a consequence of the country's location on the equator. As a result, the temperature is 
exceedingly high, leading to increased water evaporation and subsequently high rainfall levels. Rainfall intensity at 
the Kemayoran station in Central Jakarta is particularly high, with a reduction only occurring during June and July.

6. Conclusion 
The factors influencing consumers in accepting household rainwater harvesting implementation are influenced by 
Rainwater Harvesting Intention. The Attitude factor is influenced by Awareness of Consequences and Ascription of 
Responsibilities. The Rainwater Harvesting Intention factor is influenced by Perceived Benefits, Perceived Quality, 
and Attitude. The perceived quality and benefits of the harvested rainwater have a significant impact on the 
acceptance of household rainwater harvesting by users.

Abstract 
In the present research, through a systematic literature review, we seek to describe the application of seaweed in the 
production of noodles, as an alternative to traditional preparation and to improve the nutritional content of noodles. 
For this, in the first place, papers were extracted from different databases such as Scopus and Google Scholar. Then, 
the most relevant information was analyzed and extracted from each scientific article. With this information, the 
objectives were answered.  Finally, the results were analyzed in detail and the doors were opened for new research on 
noodles reinforced with seaweed, but centralized in Peru. Thanks to this research, it can be said that the application of 
seaweed in small proportions (<= 5%) is beneficial at the nutritional level, since it increases the amount of proteins, 
fiber and minerals, as well as decreases the amount of carbohydrates and fats.

1. Introduction
According to Su a rez et al. (2018), the demands in the food sector together with the new orientations in nutrition have 
generated a new avenue towards the elaboration of alternative foods, that is, consumers are looking for foods that are 
healthy, nutritious and, in addition, that taste good and require a low cost. Wheat-derived foods are in high demand in 
much of the world, so most countries need to import wheat to meet the demand of their population (Munandar et al. 
2019). On the other hand, Al Barr et al.  (2021) found that recent research shows that a substitute for wheat is being 
sought for both noodle production and other foods. As well as, due to the large quantities of imported wheat, in 
countries such as Indonesia, the main objective is to reduce high costs and improve the nutritional content of products. 
Afterwards, Varela et al.  (2019) discovered that dry pasta is a common food in several countries due to its high 
consumption, for example, Latin America is in fourth place in the world with respect to per capita consumption of 
wheat and has a value of 64 kilograms per year per person, in addition Peru is the second country in Latin America 
that consumes more noodles (Castillo and Olivos 2018). This is mainly because wheat flour noodles are a low-cost 
food with a high level of ease in their preparation, in addition to having a long shelf life and pleasant sensory 
characteristics. However, according to Pongpichaiudom et al. (2018), wheat flour-based noodles have high levels of 
fat and carbohydrates, as well as low levels of protein which makes it a product with certain characteristics deficient 
in its nutritional level. 
With these conditions, various substitutes for wheat flour have been sought, such as those explained below. For 
example, Pongpichaiudom and Songsermpong (2018) established that noodles enriched with chicken, egg and 
seaweed would have a higher amount of protein and, in addition, a lower amount of fat, even have a lower number of

Figure 2. Content in noodles reinforced with seaweed 
 
The algae have been used in small proportions, less than 5% to not affect the texture and taste of the noodles. In all 
cases there was an improvement in the final product so when applying any type of algae in the noodles, improvements 
in its nutritional content would be generated. These algae come from various parts of the world, so you can also see 
the application of seaweed-reinforced noodles in the future in Peru. 
 
6. Conclusion 
It is concluded that noodles reinforced with seaweed present an improvement in their nutritional characteristics, since 
there is an increase in the amount of protein and dietary fiber, as well as a reduction in the amounts of fats and 
carbohydrates. Then, the color of the noodles occurs according to the color of the seaweed and without negatively 
affecting the taste of the noodles. With respect to how the proportion of algae affects the finished product, it is concluded 
that these have to be used in a proportion less than 5% so as not to affect the texture of the noodles. 
The composition of the algae in all cases have a large amount of fiber and are rich in proteins in most cases. The main 
additives in addition to the algae are salt, water, wheat flour and egg with this it can be obtained the noodles reinforced 
with seaweed. 
Finally, the benefits of incorporating the algae into the finished product are that it generates at a physiological level 
such as the reduction of cholesterol and at the metabolic level through the increase of fiber which improves the 
intestinal tract.

Abstract 
Rural communities feel marginalized because they are unable to build their own future and lack the tools and support 
to do so. In exchange, they are offered assistance policies, generally designed by bureaucrats with no knowledge of 
reality and with a top-down vision, who submit them to obey third-party decisions. In this context, through case 
studies, it is analyzed how to generate social innovations and social technologies from the bottom up with the 
participation of communities and academia, seeking rural development, autonomy and democratization. The main aim 
of this study is building up a business cycle model for communication between university and community to success 
social innovation.

Abstract 
Geopolymer concrete concept has attracted attentions during the last two decades due to its superior 
properties, that has made it good and a potential alternative to ordinary Portland cement. The current study 
therefore, aimed to study the effect of acid on silica and aluminum content of geopolymer concrete and its 
optimum study. This was achieved by using experimental design tool by adopting central composite design 
(CCD) technique resulting in a total number of 13 experimental runs for optimum acid concentration effects
on the geopolymer concrete mix. Water and acid concentrations were variable parameters used to study
their effects on concrete mix, with boundaries of 2-5 ml and 5-10 ml for acid and water concentrations
respectively. These two variables were selected to optimize the chosen key factors such as the silicate (SiO2)
and alumina (Al2O3) contents of the mix. These were inputted on the design of experiment interface, studied 
the effects as responses and simulated for ANOVA analysis and optimization. The mass to volume variation
trends recorded for SiO2 and Al2O3 were 23.1 to 20.3 kg/m3 and 6.1 to 5.1 kg/m3 respectively. The silica to
alumina ratio and silica to magnesium ratio of the geopolymer concrete contents were established to be 3.7
and 5.5 respectively which were within the specifications range. It is concluded that, the optimum acid
treatment was established as evidence from the R2-values of both silica and alumina which were close to 1
and the error difference between the predicted and validated values of 2.9 and 3.0 % respectively. The
models therefore, are significant as their probability greater than F-value are less than 0.05 in each case.

1. Introduction
Geopolymer is considered is considered as an alternative material to Portland cement owing to its benefits 
in terms of environmental protection and energy conservation when compared to the other types. This is 
justified since about 43 to 59 % energy reduction can be achieved during production as compared to 
conventional concrete (Abdul, et al., 2022). In addition to the excellent acid resistance. Geopolymerization 
is the reactions that occur between silicon (Si), aluminum (Al) and natural source product such as 
metakaolin or as fly ash which is a byproduct materials with alkali liquids combine together to establish 
geopolymer binders Ma et al., (2018).  Furthermore, geopolymerisation increases the strength of 
geopolymer concrete after being exposed to elevated temperatures (Jabulani et al., 2022). Many researches 
have been reported on the study of geopolymer chemistry, structural performance in terms of geopolymer 
concrete members when subjected to service loading, such as, beams and columns and steel fiber reinforced 
geopolymer concrete. However, despite that geopolymer has good resistance to acid, the performance 
effects on the optimum acid concentration on the material has not been investigated. Therefore, this work 
aimed to study the effect of acid on silicon and aluminum content of geopolymer concrete.

6. Conclusions 
In this study, the effect of acid on geopolymer concrete mix was established as the silica and alumina 
contents of the formulation were reduced from 23.1 to 20.3 kg/m3 and 6.1 to 5.1 kg/m3 respectively within 
the investigation period. The silica to alumina ratio and silica to magnesium ratio of the geopolymer 
concrete contents were established to be 3.7 and 5.5 respectively which were within the range of 
specifications. It is also concluded that, the optimum acid treatment was established as evidence from the 
R2-values of both silica and alumina which were close to 1 and the error difference between the predicted 
and validated values of 2.9 and 3.0 % for the silica and alumina respectively. The models therefore, are 
significant as their probability greater than F-value are less than 0.05 in each case.

Abstract 
According to the World Health Organization (2018), a large part of the population requires a wheelchair to be able to 
mobilize and perform their daily activities. Conventional wheelchairs have been used for years to assist users in their 
mobility. However, it is believed that people's needs have evolved over the years and they are currently looking for 
something more in assistive devices. So, what this project wants is to give the user more control over the angle, 
positions and height of the wheelchair seat to improve the quality of life of this person. 
The control will incorporate both manual and automatic control. the manual drive system to control the movement 
and height of the chair. The automatic control applying a PID control with data obtained from an IMU as an input and 
its output is the voltage to drive the motor, which activates an electric piston that regulates the inclination of the 
wheelchair seat by 3 degrees, all this improves the quality of life of the person and makes the development of their 
activities more practical. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
According to research conducted by INEI in 2012, it is estimated that there is a disabled population of approximately 
1.6 million individuals in Peru, of which 59% suffer from some form of motor disability that limits or prevents their 
mobility and the performance of daily activities. Globally, in 2018, the World Health Organization reported that 
around 70 million people require the use of a wheelchair. 
Electric wheelchairs provide greater utility than conventional wheelchairs, but in addition to mobility, people also 
need to perform other actions such as reaching the window of a bank, picking up objects from a shelf, maintaining a 
conversation with a person at a comfortable height, and keeping the seat position stable during inclination 
disturbances. 
This paper presents the design and implementation of a mechatronic system that allows for the control of wheelchair 
movement, direction, and height, as well as the stability of the seat at an angle of 3 degrees. 
1.1 Objectives 
●
Develop a PID control system for the automatic regulation of the wheelchair seat tilt to 3 degrees.
●
Design and build a manual control system for the displacement, direction, and height regulation of a
wheelchair.
●
Design and construct a mechanical system for a wheelchair that enables height and tilt regulation.
2. Literature Review
Reviewing the literature, various contributions to the technology used in electric wheelchairs were found. Aulia et al. 
(2021) implemented the development of a Fuzzy PID control, which allows regulating the speed and remaining stable 
at an angle not greater than 10°. Results were obtained with 80% effectiveness in users with different weights. Mikhail 
(2021) developed a control system using methods on control theory that makes it possible to stabilize the object when 
moving on horizontal and inclined surfaces. The proposed algorithms register and analyze the distance and movement 
to guarantee the possibility of vertical movement with greater precision and to be controlled in different modes. Wafa

5.1 Proposed Improvements  
Although the results are satisfactory, there are many possible improvements to the prototype, both in the mechanical 
and control parts. 
 
Adding encoders and their own PID control as part of the control for wheelchair movement could allow for more 
precise movements. The mechanical system could be improved by adding a suspension system that reduces vibrations, 
as shown in Figure 15, and reducing the weight of the wheelchair by using aluminum instead of steel.

6. Conclusions  
The development of this project allowed for the programming and design of a mechanical and electronic wheelchair 
system that fulfills the set objectives. A PID control system was successfully programmed for automatic regulation of 
the wheelchair seat inclination at 3 degrees, as well as a manual control system for movement, direction, and height

regulation of the chair. In addition, a mechanical system was designed that allows for safe and efficient regulation of 
height and inclination. 
 
The implementation of the control system was successful, enabling effective use by individuals with reduced mobility. 
The PID automatic control system allowed for precise regulation of the seat inclination, providing greater comfort for 
the user. Furthermore, the manual control system provided greater autonomy for the user, allowing for easy movement, 
direction, and height regulation of the seat. 
 
In summary, the project successfully integrated the programming and design of a mechanical and electronic 
wheelchair system that allows for safe and efficient regulation of height and inclination, providing greater comfort 
and autonomy for individuals with reduced mobility.

Abstract 
It is known that industrial companies are always looking for ways to increase their productivity mainly by eliminating 
activities that do not add value, this is no different for companies dedicated to the field of plastic products, which 
usually handle a wide catalog of products, which is why they usually deal with changes on demand, causing high 
configuration times during working hours. The SMED methodology was applied in the task of mold changing on an 
injection machine of the company Avanplast S.A.C due to the high configuration times that the mold changes took, 
this due to the variety of plastic products that are made in the company. In order to reduce the high configuration 
times, eliminate external tasks and reduce the economic impact, different engineering tools such as Value Stream 
Mapping, Model A3 and 5s applications were developed. As a result, a 46.3% reduction in configuration time was 
obtained, the elimination of nine external operations and a saving of $5017.96 per year.

1. Introduction
Many entrepreneurs on the Peruvian market try to succeed and reach their objectives to have a small participation on 
the current market on the way to be in the future an important reference enterprise. For many years, people with these 
business objectives were limited by the knowledge of the market about available technology and digital tools, but it’s

377","6. Conclusion 
Nowadays, entrepreneurships should be updated with the latest technological and digital tools that industry could 
support to be successful in the market and reach their objectives. Talking about agile methodologies should not be a 
topic without relevance in the company strategies, because it provides a better understanding about how to operate in 
a fast-changing environment such as the 21st century, specifically on the meat industry, where there are a lot of 
companies that have a better experience and performance in the current market. On the same way, digital marketing 
it’s a relevant topic to be considered on the business development, where using a group of technological tools and key 
indicators, organizations could get propose better strategies to reach the customer. It’s important to remark that 
strategies followed by the company and their efficient use of digital tools available would be determinant to 
differentiate the new product of the competitors, catch the customer's attention and loyalty them. To materialize that 
business idea and reach the entrepreneurs goals, it’s going to be necessary to have a general perspective and knowledge 
of the customer and the market where people are going to be involved (considering demographic characteristics such 
as age or gender), then determine the product features, which could be improved by small and iterative tests with the 
customer’s experience (MVP), and finally manage the digital customer experiences through the digital tools that are 
available for all enterprises such as social media and web pages. Once this all aspects are integrated, and the company 
counts with all relevant information to operate, the agile business model is when it could start to work with all this 
data articulated. If an entrepreneur wants to start a small business, specially related to the meat industry, a lot of factors 
should be considered, to predict future economic or financial situations of the company and improve their strategies 
on the market where they are involved. The main ingredients of the proposed product are Guinea Pig, which is a 
special meat, with healthier benefits compared to their closest competitors (such as chicken, pork and turkey), and 
quinoa, a healthy and interesting complement which differentiate even more from the closest competitors. In order to 
improve a product with this attractive and alternative ingredient, there are several factors of the business market to 
improve, because with the numeric predictions and software evaluation, having a Financial of NPV 278,995 PEN and 
an Economic NPV of 139,969 PEN is low compared to other previous investigations, but their explanation is mainly 
because having this product as an important input on the following investigation to produce nuggets is expensive, but 
with digital improvements and efficient election of the business strategies, better results could be generated, 
considering that nowadays more people prefer to buy healthier products than the usual ones.

perfume ESSENCIAL de mayor duración de fragancia. El estudio aporta la importancia de saber que la 
subjetividad de los catadores no influye en la duración de las fragancias y la mejora de la calidad del perfume o 
en la elaboración de nuevas fragancias en el mercado a partir de componentes químicos básicos como etanol 
desnaturalizado (C2H6O), esencia o fragancia, fijador, propilenglicol (C3H8O2) y agua destilada (H2O)

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to describe a model of a practical experiment that can be applied in the classroom 
about the importance of concepts associated with the Design of Experiments course using the R language and 
SPSS. The completely randomized block design of the experiment model was selected in order to determine 
whether or not there are significant differences in the fragrance durations of four types of perfumes with four 
tasters, of the NATURA perfume brand. Then, in order to ensure the accuracy of the results, the normality, 
homoscedasticity of variances and independence of residuals tests were verified. After performing the 
experiment, the ANOVA analysis indicated that there is a significant difference in the fragrance durations of the 
perfume types at 95% confidence and also evidence that there is no significant difference in the sensory 
evaluation of the tasters. We then proceeded to perform a Post Hoc analysis: DMS, Tukey and Bonferroni with

Conclusions 
● 
The model assumptions of normality, homogeneity of variance and independence of residuals were 
made and were verified to be satisfied by the statistical tests, the results found in the ANOVA are 
consistent or reliable. 
● 
There is a significant difference between the fragrance durations of perfume types according to their 
type at 95% confidence, even if they belong to the same brand. 
● 
The EKOS type of perfume has the shortest fragrance duration time, with an average of 45.12 minutes. 
● 
The ESSENCIAL perfume type has the longest fragrance duration with an average duration of 112.12 
minutes. 
• 
The test also shows that there is no significant difference in the sensory evaluation of the tasters. The 
study brings the importance of understanding that the subjectivity of the tasters have no influence on 
the duration of the fragrances and the improvement of the perfume quality or the development of new 
fragrances in the market from basic chemical components such as denatured ethanol (C2H6O) , essence 
or fragrance, fixative, propylene glycol (C3H8O2) and distilled water (H2O) including the exclusive 
perfume components that have a longer duration of ESSENCIAL fragrance and other new components. 
● 
Understanding the variability of the fragrance duration of perfumes is one of the essential requirements 
for every consumer, to select the type of perfume that can provide the best experience when using it. 
 
Recommendations 
● 
It is recommended to perform the experiment with more types of perfume of the same brand, in order 
to get to know and have a more exhaustive record of the durations of these perfumes. 
● 
Due to the limitations of the experimenters, 2 perfumes for men and 2 perfumes for women were used, 
so it is suggested to separate the types of perfume according to the gender to which they are aimed.  
● 
Due to the limitations of the experimenters, the application of these perfumes was directly to a piece of 
paper of 15.96 cm2; not knowing if the duration time may vary according to the surface applied; this is 
why it is recommended to perform it on different material surfaces, or to apply it on human skin. 
● 
To better distinguish the perfume being tasted, it is recommended to smell cinnamon or coffee between 
each sample. 
● 
In the experiment performed, a bond paper was used, but for greater precision it is recommended to use 
olfactory paper, which is specifically made to enable a more adequate sensory analysis. 
● 
Apply the design of experiments of mixtures in Fragrances, based on the results obtained to optimize 
the composition of new combinations of components to obtain the best results in terms of quality, 
performance, and cost.

Abstract 
An approach to course planning in educational programs was presented in Madan and Gnanendran (2020). There, 
each student’s journey through a degree program was viewed as a “project” requiring completion of a set of tasks 
(courses) with each task having a specific duration (semester) and, possibly, precedence requirements (prerequisites). 
The institution is expected to offer courses in an appropriate sequence and timing so that students may progress toward 
graduation efficiently. Given the large number of students that could matriculate every semester, the institution needs 
to manage myriad individual degree pathways. To make this problem tractable, Madan and Gnanendran (2020) 
considered cohorts of students, rather than individuals, according to when each entered the program. The institution 
then only needs to manage a limited number of simultaneous projects with outcomes that are measured on the typical 
criteria of time and cost. 
Recently, researchers (e.g., Rigby et. al., 2016) have espoused the “agile” approach over the traditional “waterfall” 
approach to managing projects in environments where changes to requirements are to be expected, the work can be 
modularized, and there are avenues to collaborate with end-users. Since degree programs possess all of these 
characteristics, we propose heuristics based on agile methodology to address course planning and demonstrate their 
application via numerical examples.

Abstract 
In recent years, significant technological developments have been recorded in the Republic of Türkiye, especially in 
the field of the defense industry. Incentive and support policies have been developed and some strategic goals to be 
achieved have been determined in order to sustain these developments in the defense industry and other areas. Within 
this context, the National Scientific and Technological Research Council started a program in order to support the 
development of manufacturing technologies for the defense industry under the collaboration of leading defense 
industry companies and experienced universities on manufacturing processes. While the technical work within this 
research has important contributions to the economic and technical development in the country, it also has some effects 
on the national technology-based strategic goals of the country. In this study, the evaluation of the effects of the 
program on these targets is modeled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Benefits-Costs-Opportunities-Risks 
(BOCR) based Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is applied to evaluate the effects of the program on national 
technology-based strategic goals and the contribution of the program to each goal is calculated.

1. Introduction
Additive Manufacturing, which emerged in the 1980s through the work of Charles Hull, facilitates the efficient and 
cost-effective production of complex products with unique microstructures and material properties (Parsazadeh et al. 
2023). This technology, also known by different terms such as 3D printing and layered manufacturing in the literature, 
is used in various industries to describe an additive process in which material is added layer by layer to create physical 
prototypes, product parts, or final products from digital data (Matos 2019).  
Although additive manufacturing technology has been used primarily for prototype production worldwide for 
approximately 25 years, its use has increased significantly in recent years, particularly in the medical, automotive, 
aerospace, and space industries. The use of additive manufacturing technology in the manufacturing industry will not 
only reduce manufacturing costs and increase efficiency but also change the conventional supply chain structure and 
business models (The Economist 2018). Additive manufacturing is considered a more suitable technology for

Criteria weights were used to aggregate score values of strategic goals with respect to criteria. Based on the BOCR –
AHP analysis, aggregated score of each strategic goal was calculated as they are presented in Table 4.

Based on the aggregated score values, it can be concluded that the research program contributes to the 10th strategic 
goal of Türkiye (having at least 23 smart products with world-leading market share or brand value in at least one of 
the disruptive technology areas) most. The ranking of strategic goals found as: 
 
A10 >> A5 >> A7 >> A6 >> A4 >> A11 >> A9 >> A3 >> A1 >> A12 >> A2 >> A8 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, BOCR – AHP analysis is made to evaluate the effects of a research program supported by the Scientific 
and Technological Research Council of Türkiye on Türkiye’s technology-based national strategic goals. Within the 
research program, it is aimed to develop additive manufacturing technologies in the aviation and space industry. To 
measure the effects of the program on national strategic goals, a literature review was conducted to determine the 
social effects of additive manufacturing technologies. Then, a series of meetings was performed with program 
stakeholders to collect their opinions about the program’s effect on the national strategic goals and criteria evaluation. 
Collected data were used to calculate the importance degree of evaluation criteria and the contribution of each goal 
was calculated by the additive formula of BOCR analysis. 
 
The social effects of additive manufacturing may have some interactions. Not taking this issue into account can be 
seen as the main limitation of this study. For this reason, an ANP-based BOCR analysis will be conducted in further 
studies. Moreover, the utilization of linguistic terms for the evaluation of criteria and goals can be modeled by using 
fuzzy methodologies in further studies.

Abstract 
This paper investigates a multimodal system that integrates the general dial-a-ride problem with a set of fixed-line 
vehicles having a flexible schedule. The passenger trips are made in a three-stage journey using a dial-a-ride vehicle 
and a fixed-line bus. Passengers are picked up from an origin point and transferred to a collecting point via a dial-a-
ride vehicle. Then, fixed-route buses transfer passengers to a second collecting point where another dial-a-ride vehicle 
will pick up and transfer them to their requested destination. The main objective of this integration is to reduce the 
total trip cost by carrying part of it through cheaper fixed-route service while maximizing the utilization of seats in 
the fixed-route vehicle. The model provides each fixed line with a suggested start time. A mixed-integer linear 
programming model was developed for the problem, and computational testing on small-size instances has been 
carried out to demonstrate the viability of the proposed system.

1. Introduction
Modern communities need transport networks that provide convenience and excellent productivity with minimal 
noise, emissions, costs, and delays. Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) is a problem of managing a transport system that 
provides individuals with multi-occupancy, door-to-door transport services. It could be considered an optimization 
problem that satisfies a group of requests; each request deals with a set of passengers transferred from different origins 
(pickup points) to required destinations (delivery points).  
1.1 Objectives 
Balancing cost and time in transportation transit systems is always the primary challenge research should solve, as 
cost-efficient trips with lower time are conflicting objectives. While DARP is not the optimum economic solution, 
there was a need for a multimodal transportation system that combines more than one transportation system to reduce 
costs. Transit systems allow passengers to use more than one transportation type. Fixed-line buses are one of these 
types that are relatively cheap in comparison with others. So, each trip in multimodal transportation systems costs less 
than when carried out by DARP from origin to destination. Scheduled bus or train services can carry many passengers 
(thus are cost-efficient) but travel on fixed routes at scheduled times to which passengers must adjust their travel plans. 
Ho et al. (2018) have compared three transportation types of multimodal transportation systems that combine more 
than one transportation system (see Table 1). These types will be used in the present model formulation to exploit 
each type’s benefits best and avoid its disadvantages as much as possible. Two transportation systems are used to 
complete each request: a dial-a-ride system (i.e., taxi service) and a fixed-line system (i.e., scheduled bus service).

Computational results in that table show that instances of up to 16 requests can be solved optimally (without GAP 
value) in a reasonable time. Optimality GAP value raised in 32-request models. Table 3 shows the resulting bus kick-
off timetable at each transfer station.

*Gap percentage and time limit, Since DARP is an extension of the VRP, an NP-hard problem, time limits must be 
used to restrict the time allotted for solving the model. In most cases, time limits result in a gap between the current 
best solution and the lower bound. The computation time limit for 32-request instances was set to 30 minutes, and the 
optimality gap was consistently below 2%, as noticed in Table 2. Thus, the results indicated that the algorithm can 
efficiently solve instances of up to 32 requests in a reasonable time with an accepted time gap.

This paper has extended the model for a multimodal dial-a-ride system with the opportunity to have a flexible schedule 
that aims to minimize the cost of all trips while giving an optimum kick-off schedule for fixed-line vehicles, along 
with all constraints of timing and locations. A mixed-integer model for several small-seized problems was proposed 
and solved, and an optimum solution that minimizes the overall cost of the transportation system as well as the 
optimum schedule of used fixed routes that compromise its capacity and cost was found. The model has been tested 
on a different number of requests and different geographic distributions. The computational results provided the cost 
of each run, complete paths for each vehicle route, and fixed-line vehicle schedule.  
 
The proposed model is essential for further research to be more efficient by using heuristic and meta-heuristic methods 
that can be developed later to solve medium to large-sized problem instances. The proposed model could be 
investigated on a broader scale by a greater number of requests and routes, which will lead to a more realistic model 
that can be applied to serve society. Moreover, the transportation environment could change (e.g., cancellation 
requests). In terms of realistic aspects, algorithms for solving a dynamic situation of the proposed model can be 
developed.

Abstract 
In this research we want to searching the factor in the knowledge management strategy that is suitable and can be 
used in MRO industry. This research is focusing on searching the most important factor in knowledge management 
that can increase employee capability.  Often, we find out in organization that they did not have a good knowledge 
management system, the effect of that is there’s a huge possibility of losing knowledge when the employee gone. 
The research will try to answer question “what a criterion for a knowledge management system to be considered 
good for increasing employee capability”. Our research method will be using literature study about knowledge 
management criteria, and using structural model to knew which part of knowledge management that can increase 
employee capability. The result of this research that, we can identify a good criterion for knowledge management for 
a company that works in MRO industry, that can also increase their employee capability.

1. Introduction
Airplane industry is one of the industry that hit hard during the covid pandemic. Since the airplane industry is 
affected cause of covid, it also makes the other industry related to airplane got the same effect. One of it is MRO 
(Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) industry for airplane. When Covid-19 hit the world, all the company that 
moves in MRO industry had to limit their operational. They had to limit their operational because the airplane 
industry as their main customer is also halting their operation. Because of that many airplane company replanned 
their maintenance schedule or shut-down completely leave the MRO industry had a decrease in customer. Due to 
the airplane industry that hit hard during pandemic, the MRO industry need to adapt to their new economic 
condition. One of the adaptation they had to do is to adapt to the human resource they have. During pandemic the 
company need to do some things to make the company operates optimal, some of it are; contract restructurization 
with vendor, partner, creditour or even customer, readjusment of price that already been agreed on, and other 
things. The effect of the adaptation were there are 134 employee affected with the company policy to reorganize 
from the company during 2020 – 2021. The condition around airplane industry also force the employee to resign, 
or go to another company, due to that the company lose their precious employee, and the precious knowledge they 
had in their self.

5.2MICMAC Analysis 
Using result we got in ISM analysis, we can make the graphic for MICMAC analysis. 
 
 
Figure 4. MICMAC Analysis of Knowledge Management System  
 
 Based on the MICMAC analysis, we then can group all of this enabler into quadrant as follows : 
• 
Sector I – Autonomous Factor (Weak driving power, weak dependant power) 
Leadership and support (5), reward from contribution (6), knowledge storing (8), knowledge management 
system visualization (17). 
• 
Sector II – Dependant Factor (Weak driving power, strong dependant power) 
Ways of storing knowledge (7), informal learning (9), ways of updating knowledge (10), ways of sharing 
knowledge (11), worker motivation (14), ways of searching information (16). 
• 
Sector III – Linkage Factor (Strong driving power, strong dependant power) 
Company culture (3), sharing culture (4). 
• 
Sector IV – Independent Factor (Strong driving power, weak dependant power) 
Knowledge management infrastructure (1), IT for knowledge management (2), company policy (12), top 
management instruction (13), top management commitment (15). 
 
5.3Proposed Improvements 
Using result we got from ISM and MICMAC analysis we than proposed the improvement for designing knowledge 
management in MRO industry to increasing employee capability as follows :  
1. The company need to support or increase their infrastructure for applying knowledge management system 
in the organization 
2. The company need to increase the usage of IT technology in the application of their knowledge 
management system 
3. The company need to promote or create a policy that based on their knowledge management system, and 
show commitment to run the policy they create 
4. The top management need to create an instruction to be followed by the whole company about the 
application of knowledge management 
5. The top management need to show commitment that they also will support and do the policy they create 
about the knowledge management system 
6. The company needed to create a whole knowledge culture around daily operational as a whole system 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on our research we can conclude that it took a whole layer of people in organization/company to might be 
created a good knowledge management system in MRO company with the purpose of increasing employee 
capability.  From this research we learn that the most important thing when creating a knowledge management 
system is to had a company culture that support the impelementation of knowledge management system and to have

Abstract 
In this study, we assess the gulf cooperation council countries’ technology transfer (TT) framework to determine 
whether GCC has the foundation and structure necessary for a successful technology transfer. This study describes 
the challenges and obstacles facing the GCC countries in implementing TT. In addition to providing suggestions to 
maximize community benefits, promote TT locally to increase local self-sufficiency, and provide the necessary 
recommendations to increase its effectiveness and value.

1. Introduction
Technology transfer (TT) is a protracted, complex, and multifaceted process impacted by several variables from 
various sources. It includes the adoption and use of the technology in the receiving organization as well as the transfer 
of technological assets, knowledge, and implicit knowledge from one organization to another. The effective transfer 
of relevant technologies is essential for the long-term sustainability of developing nations' economies and societies. 
Technology transfer is not a brand-new phenomenon. The spread of technology happens naturally through commercial 
and military contacts, skills, technology, and abilities are transferred from one culture to another. Prior to the colonial 
era, technology and invasions were frequently transferred from the East to the West. The majority of today's debate 
about technology transfer is around North-South technology transfer. On the other hand, technology transfer between 
industrialized countries takes place on a far larger scale.  
The direct acquisition of capital goods and equipment, national training in specific technologies, and the engagement 
of foreign specialists and consulting firms are all examples of direct transfer channels. The development of wholly 
owned subsidiaries by foreign corporations, developing turnkey plants and facilities, and joint ventures with regional 
businesses are examples of indirect strategies. We have to acknowledge there will always be a technical divide 
between developed and developing nations. Due to the European industrial revolution and the rise of highly 
industrialized advanced nations, this gap has been widening since the early nineteenth century. After gaining 
independence, less developed nations worked to close the technological divide because advanced technology is the 
cornerstone of economic development. 
Technology is transferred and commercialized through official and unofficial channels, t. Training and education, 
hiring of students and researchers from universities and businesses, sharing tools and equipment, technology services 
and consulting, sponsored research and R&D cooperation, and other mechanisms are examples of formal channels.

• 
The GCC countries' joint projects strategy, which involves establishing industrial ventures with local partners, 
hasn't worked well, as previously mentioned. The foreign spouse broadens his knowledge and talents, while 
the local partner narrows his skills. 
• 
While some economists believe it will have a negative effect, others believe / think it will have a significant 
positive impact on the quality and effectiveness of future investment. The opposing view asserts that this 
justifies the investment's drawbacks, which prevent it from aiding developing nations in achieving technical 
independence. 
• 
Such a crucial relationship is absent in the GCC countries, despite the degree of correlation between business 
unit plans and R&D activity being a deciding factor in technology development. 
• 
The GCC countries only spend a small portion of what developed nations budget for R&D. For instance, the 
GCC Countries spent just 0.3% of their GDP on scientific research in 2021, compared to 3.1%, 2.21%, and 
3.3% in the US, China, and Japan, successively.  
• 
As the leading consumer of innovations resulting from research and development, the GCC industrial sector 
typically engages in little to no research and development. Moreover, the local scientific research institutions 
are still under scrutiny from the business community. Furthermore, The Industrial sector does not provide 
any grants to conduct research or collaborate with the universities 
• 
Government-funded R&D teams have not produced enough economically and commercially viable 
technologies. 
• 
The GCC countries did not cooperate in any way, i.e., they did not have a consistent plan for sharing 
technology with other Arab nations. 
 
 
4. Conclusions  
 
In recent decades, technology has been the primary factor defining a nation's scientific capacity and, as a result, its 
capacity to maintain national security. The mere transfer of technology represents only the transfer and use of 
particular machines; the transfer of technology goes beyond that and involves the possession of technology by 
influencing its constituent elements.      
The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have adopted a range of technology development strategies, from 
turnkey projects to industries that depend on imported raw materials like iron, steel, aluminum, cement, steel, and 
rebar. The market required petrochemical projects and production disposal, known as technology-free transportation. 
If the GCC countries benefited from the joint venture method, it seemed to be marginally superior to the first method 
due to the foreign partner marketing half of the product, the quick setup of the project, which in the best cases did not 
take longer than three years, and the training of local human cadres to be able to manage projects, but this is not 
necessarily the case. 
The GCC nations have not developed their scientific and technological capacities despite more than four decades of 
technological warfare, at least in producing spare parts and using alternative production techniques. The GCC 
countries have been and will continue to rely on foreign expertise because they relied on importing the best Western 
technology rather than adapting and developing their industries.  
External dependency can be seen in the promotion of a product, the use of foreign checks to fund projects, and the 
acquisition of organizational skills, experience, and knowledge. Multinational firms were able to impose their terms 
and reap enormous profits through direct investment, regardless of the capabilities of the recipient countries to do so. 
The ability to breed and adapt technology in a manner that makes foreign investment react to disparities in marginal 
productivity, i.e., capital flows from abundant to scarce locations. 
 
5. Recommendations 
1. Launching a Gulf Center for Technology Transfer. The function of this center is to be an information base 
for all types of technology, such as providing the center studies on the nature of technology suitable for 
economic sectors. The center can also conduct future studies on energy and its alternatives, especially in light 
of fluctuating oil prices and instability. Studies of investment plans projects setting up a system for 
exchanging information with governmental and non-governmental institutions. 
2. Establishing a separate organization to coordinate science and technology at the level of the GCC nations 
and fostering collaboration between funding sources and those who will benefit from the research necessitates 
an efficient administrative framework at every level of scientific policy. University science departments are

the first stop, followed by organizations that conduct scientific research, and finally a Supreme Authority for 
Scientific Policy and Technology. 
3. Developing a technical unbundling strategy to enable the use of local talent and input from other industries, 
fostering the growth of local capacities and expertise. Thus forming a precise and thorough payment plan 
that outlines the sources of the costs for the various components and activities of the technology package is 
necessary. Local stakeholders should be involved in the makers' decision-making processes at different levels 
and increase their participation at each stage of project implementation at each stage of the project. A 
thorough and intensive training program should be designed, including operations and maintenance, and 
fostering and promoting local community involvement during the detailed engineering stages. 
4. Developing new technology, encouraging and motivating scientists and researchers to conduct serious 
scientific research, patent registration, and application is one of the most important requirements for 
developing a national technology. 
5. Encouraging research and development organizations to work closely with businesses and industries to gain 
businesses' confidence and increase their willingness to spend money on R&D. Several methods exist for 
achieving this. 
6. Providing support .and incentives to researchers who conduct projects in applied research with industry

Abstract 
The concept of Supply chain 4.0 is still at the beginning stage and presents an opportunity for academic research in 
related areas. Currently, a number of various research are completed in the field of Industry 4.0 and Supply Chain 
Management. However, factors of the successful integration of Industry 4.0 in the Supply Chain Industry are still 
debatable. So, it is crucial to establish a study that evaluates the impact of these major factors. The purpose of this 
study is to identify the potential factors and their impacts while adapting to Industry 4.0 in the various areas of the SC 
industries. Furthermore, the created model and suggested framework aim to analyze the result of these factors.  
The intention of this study is to provide practical guides for the organizations in the SC industries while concentrating 
on the success factors that can be controlled by the companies. The originality of this study is to find out what are the 
key business resources of the companies and their employees· work engagement to execute Industry 4.0 tools and 
technologies in order to manage Supply Chain operations successfully, creating a framework that can provide guidance 
for the practitioners in the industry to adopt such a model in the SC organizations.  
A systematic literature review was applied as a method in the research. Sixty-seven articles were evaluated in the 
research using ""Web of Science"", ""Scopus"" and ""Dergipark"" databases. As a result of the review, descriptive findings 
were spotted for studies on supply chain management and the industry 4.0 relationships. 
While this research is ongoing, the basic questions to be answered in the research are as follows: 1. What are the 
business resources that affect the industry 4.0 success levels of the supply chain companies and to what extent do 
these business sources affect the industry 4.0 success? 2. While business resources of supply chain companies affect 
industry 4.0 success levels, do companies' work engagement concept also play a role in this situation.

Abstract 
Businesses from every sector in the world require to be cost-efficient and organized. With the rise of IoT or Internet 
of things, a variety of systems can be created in order to aid businesses with the use of small devices that are connected 
to a core system such as Raspberry Pi. The monitoring of attendance is a huge part of everyday business, like when 
employees log their attendance every day for work. Teachers take attendance of their students in schools every day. 
Many of them still use the traditional way of doing the attendance with the use of pen and paper. To usher them into 
the modern world, the researchers have utilized IoT technologies to create an attendance system that is capable of 
reading RFID tags, detecting face mask, and body temperature. To make things organized, a user interface was created 
in order to track data in real-time. Data such as names, contact, numbers, and email addresses, are all important in the 
everyday operations of a business. Based on the findings of this research, it is suggested that the digitization of the 
traditional method of taking attendance greatly improves the efficiency, cost-reduction, and overall morale of a 
business.

Contactless Entry, Attendance Monitoring, Facemask Detection, Temperature Screening, Sensors. 
1. Introduction
Maintaining a well-ordered attendance and punctuality is essential especially when it comes to work and business. 
Understanding the significance of attendance every day for a job contributes to a successful career. Monitoring of the 
employees’ attendance using their RFID tag will assist the Starlord Delivery Services in monitoring their employees’ 
time in and time out. One of the best ways in monitoring the time in and out is by using RFID tags. Aside from it 
being convenient, system monitoring solutions can be integrated with RFID technology (Gabatbat 2021). Furthermore, 
the proposed system has a function that detects face masks and monitors the body temperature. The detection of face 
masks and monitoring of the body temperature is an additional function for the proposed system for the safety 
protocols implemented at Starlord Delivery Services. Smart Entry System (SES) is a device with real-time attendance 
monitoring with the help of RFID tag and has a face mask detection function, while also monitoring the body 
temperature. The researchers pursued to develop this system of RFID attendance with face mask detection and body 
temperature monitoring that would be used by the client Starlord Delivery Services in Minalin, Pampanga.  
The utilization of custom built IOT systems has been growing steadily in its use in businesses. Today, many businesses 
in various industries utilize IOT systems to enhance and optimize the traditional way of monitoring the attendance of 
employees. However, the delivery service company, Starlord Delivery Services, currently uses the traditional pen and 
paper method of recording the attendance resulting in problems such as errors in the entry of data, employees 
committing time theft, time consuming for employees since it is manual. Starlord Delivery Services would also like 
to monitor the body temperature of their employees and to make sure they are also wearing face masks. Based on the 
interviews, the researchers have come up with an idea to develop an IOT attendance system called Smart Entry System,

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The proper orientation and training of end-users are crucial in maximizing the use of any developed system. It is 
essential to provide them with basic knowledge in information technology to ensure that they can handle and fix any 
malfunction or failure that may occur. Moreover, future researchers are encouraged to upgrade the system by 
modifying it and utilizing proper equipment, assessments, decision-making, and critical thinking. To ensure better 
maintainability, it is recommended to apply an uninterruptible power supply to prevent the system from shutting down 
during electricity interruptions. Additionally, to improve usability, the use of RFID cards instead of RFID tags is 
suggested to make the system more compatible. These recommendations aim to enhance the system's efficiency and 
effectiveness, and further research can be conducted to optimize its functionality. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The main objective of the study is to develop the IoT Smart Entry System of RFID Attendance with Face Mask 
Detection and Body Temperature Monitoring for Starlord Delivery Services. This system stands as a tracker of 
employees’ attendance digitally. Also, it serves as a monitor of employees’ body temperature to carefully check if a 
person has a fever and will advise not to enter the working place and to take a rest day. Another is the detection of 
wearing a face mask for personal protection as until now, we strictly recommend the wearing of face mask in a working 
station to avoid the spread of the virus. 
The current practices of tracking or recording employees’ attendance gained a grand mean of 4.69 with an 
interpretation of ""Strongly Agree"" or respondents of the study strongly agreed. This implies that the problems 
encountered of Starlord Delivery Services in tracking attendance are: (1) employees may commit time theft; (2) time 
consuming of manual marking of attendance; (3) possible incorrect entry of time; and (4) additional cost for materials 
such as papers & pen and additional workload to finish the task in payroll. 
The extent of compliance ISO/IEEE 25010 Software Quality Standard Characteristics based on the evidence from the 
data gathered prove that the developed system met the highest required Software Quality Standard Characteristics 
general interpretations which is “Highly Acceptable”. This implies that according to the statements; Functional 
Suitability, Performance Efficiency, Usability, Accuracy, Portability, and Maintainability the perception of the 
developed system can be materialized by the future end users. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The researchers therefore conclude the following: That, 
1. 
The developed system can supervise and record employees’ time log-in and the human resource or payroll master can 
use it as basis in payroll of the employees by showing their daily time record with calculated total hours, overtime 
hours, and under time hours worked. 
2. 
The developed system can monitor the range of body temperature of the employees through a temperature scanner 
according to the normal body temperature indicator of 37°C based on clinical methods to assess a person with fever 
as a symptom of Covid-19 infection which is automatically displayed in the monitor and can be checked and recorded 
easily. Also, it can detect if the person is wearing face-mask for protection. 
3. 
Based on the responses of the respondents interpreted as “Highly Acceptable” through descriptive surveys in line with 
ISO/IEC25010, the performance of the developed system is highly effective and recommended to use to a larger group 
of people.

Abstract 
The shortage of warehouse labor has long been a thorn in the global supply chain, and it impacts the entire company 
as well as its customers. To meet unpredictable demand, companies have been heavily reliant on daily workers, but 
the high percentage of their use need to calculate again because of the difference skill with contractual worker. This 
research aims to create an optimization model using goal programming and particle swarm optimization (PSO) 
approach that can determine the required number of contract and daily workers and optimize the cost of labor, while 
ensuring that the number of daily workers does not exceed 10% of the total number of contract workers also to improve 
productivity and optimize resources in the warehouse. The results show that the model can significantly reduce the 
use of daily workers and optimize the distribution of manpower, resulting in a reduction of total manpower needed in 
the warehouse by around 25%. Moreover, the model optimization also leads to a cost savings of approximately 19% 
compared to the previous labor allocation system.

1. Introduction
Warehouse operations refer to the processes involved in the handling, storage, and movement of goods within a 
warehouse facility. These operations can be performed by both contract workers and daily workers, depending on the 
specific needs of the warehouse. According to Porter (2011), a warehouse or warehousing is a place for storing goods 
that has other functions related to a series of supply activities such as sorting and packing goods before entering the 
distribution process. 
Warehouse manpower shortages have long been a thorn in the global supply chain, when there is a shortage of 
personnel, the repercussions are felt across the company and also to customers. Labor shortages make warehouse work 
difficult, especially amidst the growing demand for warehouse workers. Companies looking to grow should re-
examine their operations and see how to reduce the impact of labor shortages on operations by optimizing the 
company's workforce. 
Currently, most of the company's warehouses still require workers in large numbers to carry out tasks and carry out 
operations in the warehouse area. This is because warehouses still do not have access to the technology and robotics 
needed to automate their operations. In order to deal with unpredictable demand, companies utilize temporary workers 
(daily workers) to carry out their operations. Temporary workers or casual daily workers have become key players in 
the warehouse and fulfillment sectors. Hiring freelance daily workers for different seasons or loads is a popular choice. 
Most companies choose to work on a day labor force instead of hiring full time employees as permanent employees 
are harder to find in these uncertain times during and after the pandemic (Space, 2022).  
This research was conducted at a logistics company and the warehouse was carried out in two Cikarang site areas, 
where there were 6 warehouses. Then data is collected for workers who are directly related to warehousing operations

6. Conclusion  
This research optimization model using goal programming to formulated the model with all of the constraint and 
computational experiment conducted in this study showed that Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) implemented in 
Microsoft Excel can effectively and efficiently solve multi-objective problems and provide significant reductions in 
cost and workers needed for the project. The PSO algorithm was able to find the optimal solution within a reasonable 
number of iterations, and the results were found to be consistent and robust to changes in input parameters. The 
reduction in total cost and workers needed for the project highlights the potential benefits of using GP and PSO for 
multi-objective optimization problems, and can provide valuable insights and the impact of resource allocation on 
project outcomes. Further research could explore the application of PSO to other problems and the use of different 
optimization techniques to compare the results. Additionally, the impact of PSO on other aspects of the project, such 
as the quality of the final product, could be investigated.

Abstract 
Mini-Grocery Stores are retail formats located closest to consumers' homes, where consumers’ day-to-day needs are 
quickly satisfied. During the last 3 years, discount stores in Barranquilla (Colombia) have increased their market share, 
satisfying their requirements in similar conditions to mini-grocery stores. Nowadays, these stores’ market share has 
fallen to 48%, which is still high but is further from its historical 50%. Previous studies have shown the store as a 
social phenomenon from the marketing point of view. However, before the incursion of hard discount stores, it is 
important to establish characteristics and understand their functional structures. The goal of this research is to build a 
decision model that allows us to identify the most representative channel variables and in turn to classify them 
according to those variables’ performance. A survey was applied to a sample size of 341 stores. Predictive analytics 
will be used to extract information, and data mining techniques will be applied to detect unexpected patterns. This 
study will be able to define a logistical and operational intervention model that allows it to increase the store’s 
performance and establish elements that lead to an increase in its competitiveness in the retail sector. This research is 
important for mini-grocery stores, as to face competition, they must be prepared to improve their competitive 
performance in several areas. Aligned to their organizational capabilities, which are defined according to the 
development context of each store based on a set of variables that must be identified and analyzed.

1. Introduction
There are many definitions of the supply chain, including different approaches. However, for the development of this 
research, the definition employed is from the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS). APICS 
defined a supply chain as a set of processes that involve suppliers and their customers and connect companies from 
the raw material initial source to the finished product point of consumption (Pires 2012). In this sense, if you want to 
implement a management system through the supply chain, a strategic orientation towards corporate efforts is 
considered essential. To synchronize intra-company and inter-company operational capacities in a unified whole 
(Mentzer et al. 2001). Confirming that not all companies being part of a supply chain have the same management and

6. Conclusions
This research allowed us to establish a Mini-Grocery store categorization based on the analysis of four (4) important 
variables: physical space, number of employees, SKUs, and type of service. From there, three types of stores were 
identified. 
The small store has a space of less than 100 m2. It has between 1 and 2 employees serving the customers and has a 
maximum of 100 SKUs on display. The medium store has a space between 100 m2 and 400 m2. It has between 2 and 
3 employees and uses a service that includes counter and self-service sales. Finally, they have a maximum number of 
500 SKUs in their exhibition. The large store has a space greater than 400 m2, has more than 4 workers, and has self-
service sales. 
Additionally, it can be defined that Barranquilla stores’ profile tends to be small since their physical space (dependent 
variable) has a percentage of 72.7% in the category of less than 100 m2.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a company engaged in the telecommunications technology industry that produces cellular telephones and 
sells cellular telephones under its own trademark. The company runs its manufacturing processes using a combination 
of labor and the use of assembly machines, testing machines, packaging machines, and is integrated with 
manufacturing software. PT. XYZ uses Manufacturing Execution System (MES) manufacturing software in its 
manufacturing processes. MES is a comprehensive manufacturing software system for monitoring, tracking, 
documenting and controlling the process of manufacturing goods from raw materials to finished products. 
Manufacturing software must always be developed and its performance improved. Companies need to carry out 
approaches and assessments to increase the capability and maturity of digital manufacturing processes. Thus, the 
Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is used as the basis for the manufacturing software maturity measurement model 
used in the manufacturing process. The capability maturity model determines the company's current level of digital 
maturity. Then based on the gap analysis, design a strategy to increase digital maturity in the manufacturing process. 
At level 2 repeatable, PT. XYZ reaches a maturity level of 2.23, then at level 3 defined it reaches a maturity level of 
2.18. Based on the current maturity level, KPA profiling, gap analysis, and strategy development are made to increase 
the company's digital maturity level.

1. Introduction
PT. XYZ is a company engaged in the telecommunications technology industry that manufactures smart cellular 
telephones and sells these cellular telephones under its own trademark. This XYZ company is a foreign company that 
opened a factory in Indonesia. PT. XYZ has met the government's domestic content requirement standards with scores 
above 30% of the assessment parameters for the aspects of manufacture, development and mobile software. Cell phone 
products manufactured by PT. XYZ ranges from low-end, mid-range, high-end, and flagship-class phones to meet the 
needs of the Indonesian mobile phone market. 
As a company engaged in the telecommunication technology industry, PT. XYZ runs its manufacturing processes 
using a combination of labor and the use of assembly machines, testing machines, packaging machines, and is 
integrated with manufacturing software. More specifically on the cell phone production process, from the raw 
materials arriving at the warehouse, the materials entering the factory, the assembly line, the test line, the packaging 
line, finished goods sent to the warehouse, until the finished goods are sent to market, processing and process control 
are assisted by the use of Manufacturing Execution System (MES) software. MES is a comprehensive manufacturing 
software system for monitoring, tracking, documenting and controlling the process of manufacturing goods from raw 
materials to finished products.  
The manufacturing process must always be able to develop and improve its performance, especially since the 
manufacturing process also involves the use of manufacturing software. Companies need to carry out approaches and 
assessments to improve the capabilities and maturity of digital manufacturing processes. The Capability Maturity 
Model (CMM) helps companies to assess, position digital processes, and company internal resources to determine the 
current level of maturity and describe it to improve digital processes in production activities (Titov et al. 2016). The 
capability maturity model describes the path of evolutionary improvement from immature formed processes to mature

482","engineering and organizational support at level 3, maturity level 2 is obtained: repeatable with a value of 2.18. So with 
these results, it is known that the company is quite good at carrying out the manufacturing process by using MES as 
its manufacturing software.  
In the assessment of maturity level per KPA, the average score obtained has reached maturity level 2. The lowest 3 
KPAs are in KPA Software Subcontract Management, Organizational Process Definition, and Organizational Process 
Focus with respective values of 1.69, 1.79, and 1.86.  
In-depth study of the 3 KPA found that in the subcontract management software process the selection and qualification 
of the subcontractor had been carried out properly, as well as the commitments and agreements made, but the 
communication between the company and the subcontractor had not been carried out properly so that there were 
several obstacles caused by a lack of maintaining communication. As a result of not properly maintaining 
communication, this also has an impact on obstacles for tracking results and the subcontractor's actual performance. 
Companies and subcontractors must comply with the commitments made, it is required to establish a communication 
system between the company and subcontractors so that tracking results and actual performance of subcontractors can 
be ensured according to commitments. The communication platform needs to be supervised so that communication is 
more directed and in accordance with the portion of the project that should be. 
Then in the KPA Organizational Process Definition, actually standard software processes for organizations have been 
developed and maintained, but sometimes there is information related to standard use of software at the organizational 
level that has not been properly reviewed and socialized to all lines in the relevant departments. At the organizational 
level with various departments, socialization and supervision of the use of the software must be made clear structure. 
So that the standard operation of the use of software can be carried out correctly and avoid skip processes and software 
operations that deviate when executed.  
Furthermore, in the KPA Organizational Process Focus, the strengths and weaknesses of the software processes used 
are identified relative to a standard process, but the software process development and improvement activities have 
not been well coordinated at the organizational level, this is due to process development and improvement on an 
organizational scale not well planned. Because basically if software improvement activities are carried out without a 
mature plan coordinated with the relevant departments, this actually risks creating new problems that can be 
detrimental to the company. For example, there is a trial activity for the latest MES version and requires the MES 
system to restart on all lines without clear planning and coordination during working hours, then the manufacturing 
process can stop and cause losses. 
6. Conclusion
In overall, the maturity level of PT. XYZ's ability to carry out the manufacturing process using MES as manufacturing 
software is quite good with a score of 2.21 with a maturity level of 2.21. Companies need to make improvements in 
all KPA at levels 2 and 3 so that the capability maturity level can rise to level 3 starting with the lowest 3 KPA 
Software Subcontract Management, Organization Process Definition, and Organizational Process Focus. 
So, to increase the maturity level of manufacturing capabilities in using MES, companies need: 
1.
Maintain good communication with subcontractors, so that tracking results and actual performance of
subcontractors can be known with certainty so that they always follow commitments. Each meeting is made
with a meeting resolution which is reviewed by the relevant department manager so that the results of the
discussions and development directions can be monitored.
2.
Information for the organizational level must be ensured that it is available and accessible, if there are
changes, repairs, and improvements to software that need to be known at the organizational level must be
informed in advance.
3.
Process software activity plans at the organizational level must be carefully prepared and coordinated in an
integrated manner, so that cross-organizational activities can be carried out properly.

Abstract 
Advertisement blocking refers to the practice of using software or browser extensions to prevent advertisements from 
displaying on web pages or mobile applications. It is a growing trend among internet users, with an increasing number 
of people opting to block ads online. The use of adblockers has become a significant concern for businesses and 
advertisers who rely on online advertising to generate revenue. This study aims to design a DNS server that will have 
a similar function as a firewall. A small board computer called Raspberry Pi will be used to connect to a network 
where websites with ads will be filtered. A small open-source networking tool called Pi-Hole will be used for 
configuring the Raspberry Pi. The device will now be the location of network traffic traveling through the network. 
This system is applied through the use of waterfall methodology which is a linear, sequential approach to project 
development, where the development process is divided into distinct phases. These phases typically include 
requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The results of the survey show that the 
system has been accommodating to the evaluators. While adblocking software can improve the user experience by 
blocking annoying and intrusive ads, adblocking can be effective in mitigating certain information threats particularly 
those that originate from malicious ads. Malicious advertisements can contain malware or lead users to phishing sites, 
and adblocking can prevent them from being displayed on a user's device. It is very important to protect such 
information from being stolen by attackers within a network.

1. Introduction
Online Advertising is a way of getting revenue for a certain application or website. It is helpful in earning money by 
making users watch a 10-second video or publishing links that will pop up on a certain website. This is a way to reach 
the audiences and a way to monetize the content that was produced. The downside of online advertisements is that 
people tend to ignore them. Ads are found to be an annoying aspect that is present on the internet. People would not 
want to watch advertisements while browsing on social media as it is considered a waste of time. Another major 
problem with online advertising is that it could impose security and privacy risks. Cybercriminals use advertisements 
as an advantage in installing malware or collecting information by publishing phishing sites which is a domain of a 
website with the same appearance. It is difficult to identify which is a “good” or “bad” website for a user to visit. At 
present, cybersecurity plays a vital role in the devices the people use every day. Since all the transactions are accessible 
on the computer, mobile phones, and other devices, security threats need to be prioritized. The cyber threats range 
from Trojan and viruses to botnets and toolkits. At that time, 96% of smartphones do not have pre-installed security 
software in which, which opens a lot of security threats on the devices. There is traditional security software on the 
PC, e.g., firewalls, encryption, and antivirus but they are not currently available on smartphones. This study aims to 
protect devices from tracking, malware, and phishing domains that are found on malicious sites or even remove ads 
that are found to be annoying. 
1.1 
Objectives 
The study aims to implement an adblocker on a network level that will enable filtering and efficiency from the devices 
that are connected to a network against malicious domains and trackers. Websites that contain malicious, tracking and 
unwanted content will be filtered out. The study will provide protection to the devices using the DNS server and 
interactions between the client and server.

5. Conclusion 
Network Security is an important feature to be considered today.  The proponents and at the same time the users of 
the internet know that it is a duty to be vigilant against attackers within network. Cybersecurity is not something to be 
overlooked, it can somehow be challenging to manage but it will ensure that no entities will be able to infiltrate any 
system.  
The goal of this study was to be able to prevent unwanted contents to be accessed by a user and deliver a safe 
networking environment. It is quite difficult to assume whether a site is safe to visit or not. It is not advised to believe 
on anything that we see in the internet, whether it is in a form of a post, a message or even an advertisement that will 
try to persuade anyone into looking through it.  It is better to protect important information that a user possesses from 
being stolen by attackers. The Raspberry Pi is a small computer device yet there are countless of possible projects can 
be developed using this device especially in regards to security.

Throughout the whole process of this study, challenges were endured during its development and took time to apply 
all the necessary configurations to ensure that it will use its full potential. Though some issues cannot be addressed, 
the system was still able to provide its importance and through evaluation, it was found to be very useful to the clients 
and will be able to provide safety for their network.

Abstract 
Many organizations struggle to effectively manage procurement risks, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of 
the procurement process. Each and every organization's activities include procurement, and the achievement of 
corporate objectives depends on the efficient and effective execution of this process. Yet, if not properly managed, 
the risks associated with procurement activities can have a severe effect on the performance of the business. 
As a result, there is an increasing need for systematic and organized frameworks that help businesses in mitigating 
procurement risks and achieve profitable outcomes. 
The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of proven approaches to procurement risk 
management. The article will explore various risk management frameworks and highlight their key components. 
Furthermore, this paper will include a practical case study from the energy and infrastructure industry that 
demonstrates how ISO 31000, a widely recognized risk management standard, can be used to manage procurement 
risks in a large multinational corporation.

1. Introduction
In today's global and linked marketplace, effective procurement risk management is crucial for businesses to maintain 
business continuity and profitability. Supply chain disruptions, including reputational damage, unanticipated price 
increases, and delayed product delivery can have far-reaching consequences. 
Therefore, implementing an effective framework for procurement risk management can help businesses in mitigating 
these risks and guaranteeing the success of their procurement procedures, leading to improved efficiency, cost savings, 
and a competitive advantage. 
However, the process of implementing a framework for procurement risk management can be quite challenging and 
requires the allocation of resources as well as a clear strategy. Hence, organizations must interact with stakeholders 
and convince them of the framework's advantages in order to overcome these obstacles.

department, is that the overall reduction in the residual criticality of the risk has decreased as a result of the decreased 
detectability. 
 
7. Conclusion 
This research paper was conducted on procurement risk management frameworks and their benefits. The study is 
based on a real case of a prominent multinational in the energy and infrastructure sector, highlighting the advantages 
of adopting a structured and transparent approach to managing procurement risks.  
 
Initially, we started by identifying the issue and the current state, with the aim of framing the retrieved studies and 
connecting them to the main problematic faced by the procurement department of the company. Afterwards, we opted 
for a relevant risk management framework to empower the department overall profitability and evaluated the potential 
impact. Ultimately, we determined the gap between actual and required performance, and examined the factors that 
need to be adjusted, as detailed in the suggested improvements. 
 
As for our findings in this captivating field, they only constitute a starting point for potential future research, such as: 
 
-Exploring strategies for integrating sustainability considerations into procurement risk management, researchers can 
help organizations balance their social and environmental responsibilities with their financial goals. Therefore, how 
can procurement professionals effectively integrate sustainability considerations into their decision-making processes 
when it comes to procurement risk management? 
 
-What strategies can the procurement function use to effectively mitigate supply chain disruptions and ensure business 
continuity in this VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world? 
 
-The future of procurement technologies can also assist organizations in identifying new opportunities and challenges 
associated with these technologies. Hence, what role do emerging technologies such as IoT, Blockchain, AI, and 
Machine learning play in effectively managing risks to achieve optimal results in procurement risk management?

Abstract 
The Philippines is ranked as the least peaceful Asian country in accordance with common crimes like burglary, theft, 
and kidnapping. Additionally, 60.5% of these criminals enter a property violently by smashing through a window or 
a doorway. That's why it is essential to have a security camera system because the mere sight of a security camera can 
signal the presence of the law and deter criminals. The study proposed by the researchers is to develop and install an 
IOT-based Smart Security Camera System to monitor and detect any disturbances inside the XVLOZADA Hardware 
at Fil-Am Friendship Hwy, Angeles City. The smart security camera system is built using Raspberry pi 3b with camera 
and IR led, the researchers used OpenCV and Python Flask to launch the web server of the security system. The smart 
security system is packed with smart features like Image recognition, Email notification alert, Cloud storage, Video 
Recorder, and Account management. Whenever the system detects a human within its line of sight, it will use object 
detection to capture and notify the client immediately. In addition, the images captured by the system will be stored 
in the cloud which can be accessed anytime using the web application. The purpose of this study is to guarantee the 
wellbeing and security for the client, because present day business surely requires a smart system which is low-cost 
and requires little or less human exertion.

1. Introduction
According to (Statista Research Department 2021) the most frequent record of crime in the Philippines is robbery and 
theft. In 2020, there were nearly thousand instances of theft and robbery reported in the Philippines. On top of that, 
60.5% of these criminals are using brute force to enter a property. Criminals are using force like breaking windows, 
lock-picking, kicking in entryways and more to enter a property (Sofroniou 2020). In addition, when it comes to 
typical crimes like burglary, theft, and kidnapping which is why the Philippines is also considered to be the least 
peaceful country in Asia (DataLeads Asia News 2022) Luckily, Security Camera Systems are becoming more relevant 
especially for Retail stores and businesses. Having a security camera system is important because seeing a security 
camera alone lays out the presence of the law and can act as a deterrent for criminals. In fact, clients entering a store 
who realize they are being recorded are less likely to steal (Vigderman and Turner 2021). In addition, security cameras 
make life safer and simpler for property owners and business managers because this helps them distinguish any 
individual who has carried out wrongdoing in their office or home. Security cameras additionally help to prevent theft 
by workers, particularly in retail and office setup (Bennett 2018).

4. 3 Statistical Evaluation 
Total results of three (3) IT professionals who answered the survey using ISO 25010 survey in order to measure and 
evaluate the system's product quality. For a total of 32 question, 81.4% of the 3 IT experts answered excellent, and 
the rest of the 15.16% answered very good as indicated in the Statistical evaluation bar graph.

5. Conclusion 
According to the data that’s been gathered, the XVLozada hardware store has been a previous victim of burglary 
during night time, reason for them to install CCTV cameras around the store to prevent those kinds of events from 
happening. However, the manager of the store discovered some inconvenience while using their current security 
system, which includes some added fees from installing the security system, high power consumption, and inaccurate 
or misleading motion detection. With that said, the researchers proposed a smart security system which will allow the 
store manager to detect person and be notified whenever a person has been detection through Gmail alert, The system 
also includes a video recorder which will record and save all of the media file from the local media file to the cloud 
using google drive, lastly, the security camera system also includes a IR led which will help the camera to detect 
objects even in dark areas. 
 
The proposed Smart security camera system implemented for the XVLozada hardware store enhances and improves 
the hardware store's security because of the added features from the system. The manager can now rest assured that 
the system will not give false alerts since the smart security system only detects and sends email whenever it detects 
a person. The manager also does not need to worry about maintaining storage capacity since all of the recorded videos 
and screenshots are stored using cloud storage for free. 
 
Future researchers may consider the following suggestions/recommendations for enhancing the current security 
camera system: 
 
● 
Using better and latest hardware like Raspberry pi 4 to get better overall performance of the system. 
● 
Purchasing or preferably 3D printing a custom for the Raspberry pi in order to mount the system properly. 
● 
Future researchers may also consider using a pan tilt camera to get a better viewing angle from the security 
system.

1. Introduction
Trees are significant to most living beings. They supply us with oxygen and in exchange, we provide them with the 
Carbon Dioxide that they require. In addition, trees are one of the providers of some of the resources that we require 
in our everyday lives.  Lastly, trees also provide a link between the past, present, and future, thus we must care for 
them for future generations. As we all know, due to road expansion projects, numerous trees are being felled. In result, 
the researchers are developing a technology that will assist people and organizations in monitoring trees and keeping 
their numbers balanced.  
The Tree Map Management System will monitor the health of trees in a specific area. It will be designed for people 
who are interested in trees and those who care for them. The study will be held in a particular location where the 
Angeles research team will conduct experiments. Angeles’s city is widely recognized for its tree-planting programs, 
that’s why the project aims to count the trees that will be cut down and eventually record them in our database. We 
must evolve to keep up with fast-changing technologies. This effort combines the advancement of technology with 
the preservation of trees. Today's technology is advantageous and makes the task easier. Keeping track of the trees 
and registering them in our database is a massive assistance in tree preservation. With this technique, all trees in a 
particular place may be tracked and monitored. The participant may interact with other tree enthusiasts on the website 
and search the map for trees of interest.  
Tree Measurement and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping System for Forest Harvesters It is now feasible to 
obtain information on the surrounding forest, such as tree diameters, positions, and stand density, using new sensor 
and processing technology. This data may be accessed online via the operator's console. Off-line in a forest asset 
management system or decision support system. Their existing automation methods have reached their limits in 
many ways. (Omental.,N.D)

5. Conclusion  
During the early stages of gathering information, it was observed that the Save the Trees Coalition is using a manual 
method of inputting the Information that they have gathered around Angeles City. With this, the researchers 
established a web-based Tree coalition management system to help the organization improve the process of 
inputting data and other information about the trees that they are maintaining.   
The web-based Tree coalition management system was implemented for the Save the Trees Coalition to make the 
organization's management system better.  The developed web-based Tree coalition management system can serve 
the organization as an efficient and more organized management system. Also, the developed system is more suitable 
than the client's previously used management system, it lessens the client's work for inputting the information that has 
been gathered. The users and clients will be able to monitor the trees around Angeles’s city because of the web-based 
Tree coalition management system.  
There are several recommendations that the researchers are able to provide to the current version of the system. The 
following are suggestions that future researchers can take into consideration to improve the current system:  
• 
To implement additional functions and UI design in order to attract a larger number of 
individuals/clients  
• 
To have a 3D feature of the map like in google map  
• 
A high quality of images in the Viewing Section  
• 
A data detector for duplicated data  
• 
To have a filter in the comments to prevent offensive language  
• 
To have an account retrieval for the users  
• 
To have a better design for the database

Abstract 
The existing network topology of Salapungan Elementary School poses issues in their networking activities with 
inconsistencies within their network. The aim of the study was to propose a wireless network topology that will provide 
solutions and consistencies without first applying it to the campus. This study focuses on the use of proper and 
necessary routing protocols to improve the overall performance of the network topology of Salapungan Elementary 
School. The testing of the network was done in Cisco Packet Tracer, where it involved the analyzation and 
management of the devices and connection of the proposed network topology. In addition to the implementation in 
Cisco Packet Tracer, the researchers utilized the Top-Down Design in aiding them with the needs for their study. The 
findings indicate in the proposal that with standardized routing protocols such as Static Routing, DHCP, OSPF, VLAN 
and HSRP, the wireless network drastically improved. Further, the use of WPA2 amongst the Access Points serves as 
an extra layer of security in the network. It becomes evident that it expanded the network’s availability, provided a 
network failover solution and easier manageability.

1. Introduction
The impact of how technology is utilized by the hour and day highlights the progress of our society. Global access to 
the internet made the achievement of continuous innovation possible. Macabale et al. (2020) stated that the internet 
has played a vital role in teaching and collecting information and communication in academic institutions. This 
reinforces the substantial role of campus networks in the educational setting.   
The emergence of campus networks in academic institutions plays a pivotal role in this period of Information 
Technology. This new age has made campus networks just as important as our everyday essentials. Many educators, 
students, and researchers adapted to modernizing how to pass information and acquire study materials to complete 
their tasks (Ahmed et al. 2021). Both educators and students can use campus networks for various purposes, including 
teaching, learning, e-learning, supervising, publishing results, and connecting with external users (Somasundaram and 
Chandran 2018). Thus, networks contribute not only in one area of life but almost everywhere, notably in educational 
organizations. The researchers have observed that one of the predominant issues in the Salapungan Elementary School 
faces lies in the lack of wireless network security, which is crucial for a wireless campus network. In addition, the 
existing network does not have a failover solution plan and network documentation, which affects the availability and 
manageability of the network. This study focuses on giving practical solutions to the problems mentioned earlier. 
Through this study, a suitable wireless campus network design will be developed along with the necessary wireless 
network security and protocols based on the school’s needs. The network designed in this study is an improved 
network of the school’s existing network, which will be mainly simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.2.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This research is intended for those who will conduct future researches on wireless campus networks. The researchers 
believe that there is more that can be improved in the upcoming future. The comments and recommendations taken 
from the survey done by the networking professionals have suggested:  
•
To add a security policy to ensure safe data and file transferring.
•
Set a captive portal for faculties in order for them to not manually ask the IT Coordinator to provide them the Wi-Fi
passwords.
•
Implement Network and Host-based firewalls to mitigate viruses and possible cyberattacks.
•
Integrate inventory and network monitoring system.
5.4 Validation
The aim of the study is to propose a wireless campus network structure of Salapungan Elementary School while
providing improved network availability, enhanced security and manageability. The proposed design provided real-
life applicable solutions to combat the inability to have consistent connection, assigned proper configurations to
maximize capabilities of their existing network, and the expansion of their network across the buildings. Throughout
the development of the proposal, the researchers met with the IT Coordinator multiple times in order to obtain the
necessary information. Then the information obtained was utilized and assessed to transpire best suited solutions for
Salapungan Elementary School’s network specifications. The researchers utilized and implemented the proposed
wireless campus network through Cisco Packet Tracer.
The researchers have conducted a series of tests and simulations in Cisco Packet Tracer and primarily focused on
providing the solution to the observed network analysis of Salapungan Elementary School. In addition, a survey was
carried out to obtain a degree of opinions from networking professionals about the proposed wireless campus network.
From the survey, the respondents generally agreed that the proposed wireless campus network provided the practical
solutions and improved the network’s high-availability, security, and manageability.
6. Conclusion
This study presents a wireless campus network designed based on the needs and requirements of Salapungan 
Elementary School. By implementing standardized routing protocols such as Static Routing, DHCP, OSPF, VLAN 
and HSRP, the wireless network drastically improved. These expanded the network’s availability, provided a network 
failover solution and easier manageability. The IT Coordinator approved and is open to implement the proposed 
wireless campus network of Salapungan Elementary School, given that the financial restriction and time is no longer 
an issue. The proposal demonstrated that the right configurations and protocols were implemented properly in order 
to meet the requirements and demands of Salapungan Elementary School’s wireless network. As a result, the 
networking professionals survey forms came out positive and the findings gathered, weighted to the mean of 4.67 to 
5.00, shows that the respondents Strongly Agree and satisfied with the improvements offered by the proposed wireless 
campus network.

1. Introduction
In modern technology today, the efficiency of clients' digital record has become effective. This transition has resulted 
in a greater functionality of medical services as well as the opportunity for new methods to enhance research quality 
improvement programs and client service. The manual process of collecting data affects the services in loss of 
productivity.  
To find ways in securing the confidentiality and upgrading the sorting of HIV clients' healthcare records in more 
convenient way in Angeles City Primary HIV Care Clinic (Bale Angeleño), an electronic data storage management 
system is necessary and should be developed. This will be significant to both health staff and client in the hub as it 
will allow them to remotely access the health information of the client whether before the client will go to the health 
facility or whenever the health staff needs to read the health information of the client. The facility can also strengthen 
the security and accessibility of data. Furthermore, the appointment setting will include in the proposed system to 
address the problem of having disorganized set up as well as the report which indicates the total number of counts 
each case that are catered and their results. The health staff will then be able to track and monitor the effectiveness of 
their response regarding the cases of HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. This modernization of technology 
has increased the development and enhanced the connection between medical practitioner and patient, and enabled 
medical practitioner to integrate in promoting practices and knowledge for the continuous improvement of healthcare 
delivery and wellbeing (Omolara et al. 2020).

The researchers conducted several testing and interviews to reduce errors and to develop a system that maximize 
performance to deliver best service for clients. The tests were successful and researchers are able to address the issues. 
The researchers has established and came into conclusion that the majority of respondents strongly agreed with the 
usability of the recapp system.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The Angeles City Primary HIV Care Clinic (Bale Angeleño) is a public medical institution that handles confidential 
data of its clients. Based on the data gathered, the Bale Angeleño has been using the traditional method of storing 
client’s records making the process tedious. Hereby, the researchers proposed a web-based client’s healthcare record 
and appointment management system to improve the process of storing client’s records and appointment setting by 
allowing the involved users as client to track their appointments, medications, and result based on the client’s request. 
For health staffs, it benefits them to efficiently store the client’s data and track client’s appointments, total cases test 
results, medical history, and medications. Furthermore, the health staff can monitor the statistical reports of total 
appointments for both HIV & Testing and ARV/PrEP refill, total registered clients, total registered medicines, HIV & 
testing appointment per month, dispensed medicine per month and out of stock medicines.   
 
The web-based client’s healthcare record and appointment management system implemented for the Angeles City 
Primary HIV Care Clinic (Bale Angeleño) was enhanced and optimized. As a result, the developed web-based client’s 
healthcare record and appointment management system was able to serve the Bale Angeleño’s clients in more efficient 
way and maximum productivity as excellent service was achieved. Furthermore, the developed healthcare records 
management system is more suitable for clients and health staff than the traditional process of using pen and paper 
due to the fact that the clients and staff can track and store all client’s data through the system developed. Also, it 
lessened the health staff encountering problems in disorganize appointment setting and storing client’s records which 
makes the health staff work efficiently in assessing clients’ records. Thus, the clients and health staff were able to 
manage the record keeping and appointment setting because of the developed healthcare record and appointment 
management system.

Abstract 
The emergence of live streaming has resulted in the expansion of talent agencies, whose purpose is to manage and 
support live streamers. However, companies, including the Midnight Suns Company, have resorted to a manual 
management approach due to the absence of a platform for managing live streamers. To solve this problem, the 
researchers developed Esee, a web-based performance-driven employee management system that manages hosts’ 
information and tracks their performance. The system aims to provide a comprehensive and optimized approach to 
host management, as well as centralize and organize the Midnight Suns Company’s data, allowing administrators to 
focus on higher-value duties. The researchers utilized Node.js, Vue.js, JavaScript, Filestack, MySQL, HTML, CSS, 
ApexCharts.js, SendGrid, Ws, and Sequelize in developing the system. To construct the system's processes, the 
researchers also employed design thinking, an effective approach for addressing problems and identifying solutions. 
The system satisfied the client’s needs by allowing them to conveniently organize the company’s data and seamlessly 
track host performances. In addition, the system centralized the recruitment process, dashboard, announcements, 
events, leaderboard ranking, host management, report generation, and help center into a single platform.

1. Introduction
Since the rise of social media, millions of individuals are now influenced by the opinions of others expressed online. 
This opportunity has made it possible for anyone to become an ""influencer"" and earn money online through 
promotions, commissions, and affiliation. One of the rising profitable ways to earn money online is known to be live 
streaming. ReportLinker (2022) expects the Global Live Streaming Market to expand to $25.19 billion by 2026, 
increasing at a 13.47 percent compound annual growth rate. This has led to the growth of talent agencies for live 
streamers, with the goal of managing and supporting live streamers across various platforms. 
Just like in any other industry, the success or failure of a company in the live streaming industry depends on the quality 
of hosts chosen. Ijoga and Adewole (2019) highlighted the importance of human resource as an essential component 
of a company's success, claiming that human resource is the most valuable and critical resource. Moreover, Troth and 
Guest (2020) asserted that human resources are essential to the overall success of the company and are among the 
elements that enable it to realize numerous advantages. This can be attributed to the fact that a company's success is 
directly related to the amount of effort put forward by each person. Thus, human resource management is crucial as it 
can impact organizational performance by influencing employees' skills, talents, attitudes, and behaviors (Anwar and

Figure 4 depicts the average percentage of all questions that pertain to the super administrator evaluation. The results 
of the super administrator evaluation indicate that the employee management system performs well in terms of user 
interface, performance, functionality, and user satisfaction, as the sentiment comprises both Strong Agreement and 
Agreement. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The researchers suggest improving the existing system by incorporating a mobile-based version that will allow greater 
flexibility and accessibility. Additionally, it is recommended to incorporate APIs to collect more accurate and real-
time streaming data, gathering viewer information in real-time, and adding content delivery metrics to identify 
performance issues quickly. These enhancements will allow hosts to analyze their audience and create personalized 
content. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The researchers conducted a thorough analysis of the company's manual approach to employee management and 
identified areas for improvement. The system was designed to optimize recruitment, assess host applications, monitor 
performance, and centralize data management. By integrating multiple functions into a single platform, the system 
allowed administrators to maximize their efficiency and focus on higher-value activities. The success of the system 
can be measured by improvements in employee management processes and overall company performance. Therefore, 
it can be concluded that the web-based performance-driven employee management system is a valid and effective 
solution for The Midnight Suns Company. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The researchers presented a web-based performance-driven employee management system to help The Midnight Suns 
Company improve their manual approach to tracking employees and data. The new system optimized the recruitment 
process, allowed for efficient assessment of incoming host applications, and enabled administrators to monitor overall 
and individual host performance. The new platform integrated multiple functions into a single platform, allowing 
administrators to manage their data through a centralized and user-friendly interface. The new system allowed 
administrators to maximize their efficiency and focus on higher-value activities.

Abstract 
This study aims to develop a strategic framework for Indonesia's fiber cement business, focusing on those elements 
that have a significant impact on outcomes. Using a soft system methodology for risk analysis, the framework was 
created. The influence of sustainability performance is examined in this study using a tiered structure. We categorize 
significant variables as causes or effects and then specify which variables are crucial for enhancing the performance 
of Indonesia's fiber cement sector. Sustainability strategies continue to be underappreciated in Indonesia, despite the 
fact that corporate sustainability performance is a vital topic in today's economic climate. In order to aid in the 
development of a strategic framework for fiber cement sustainability in Indonesia, this study seeks to analyze the 
complexity. This study will employ a soft system methodology approach that uses a system diagram and multi-actor 
analysis to clearly comprehend the issue and establish criteria that will aid the sustainability plan framework.

1. Introduction
Fiber cement is a type of building material made by mixing cellulose fiber (2%), cement (80%), and water. In 2020, 
cement production is expected to reach 4.1 billion metric tons, three times that of 1995 (International finance 
corporation. 2021). Five countries account for nearly three-quarters of world cement production, led by China 57%, 
India, Vietnam, the United States and India (International finance corporation. 2021). The capacity of Indonesia's 
cement industry has increased to 114 million tons as of 2019, with 70 million tons of that amount intended for domestic 
use (Indonesia Cement Sales. 2019). 
The cement industry involves air pollution, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions worldwide, including sulfur 
dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). The cement producing province of North Sulawesi 
on Celebes exported 63,000 tons of cement in May 2021. Over the same period, the associated air pollution, energy 
consumption, and CO2 emissions increased due to various sustainable development measures being essential to the 
industry (Wang, et. al, 2021). The companies in the sector must develop performance metrics for sustainability. 
The concept of sustainability is currently defined as the correlation between three main principles: economic growth, 
social justice, and environmental empowerment. To achieve sustainability in the manufacturing industry, it is 
necessary to adopt an integrated approach which includes multi-dimensional indicators so that it leads to 
interconnection in the economic, environmental and social aspects (Naderi, et. al, 2017). Sutherland et al. (2016) 
suggest that a system must meet all sustainability criteria (environmental, economic and social) to be a sustainable 
system. As such, this indicator provides an important tool for organizational sustainability assessment which is not 
only helpful in identifying challenges but also important when designing sustainable scenarios. in organizations or

In the areas of policy intervention such as environmental impact, social sustainability, economic benefit, technological 
feasibility, and institutional compliance, the stakeholders acting as the problem's owner will determine the strategy. 
The stakeholder will choose all of the requirements and assess them for implementation in light of sustainable 
perspectives. From the point criteria, its risk and its impact on the decision-making process and risk management will 
be scored. 
 
The system's goal is to create a framework for sustainability strategy that best fits Indonesia's fiber cement sector. The 
manufacturing industry's internal and external factors as well as external factors from the government are inputs into 
the system. The results include the industry's foundation for sustainability in the fiber cement sector. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The criteria decision for the sustainability framework needs to be conducted to help the stakeholders to help them 
implement the framework. As a result of this study, the stakeholders who require a decision-making process have been 
identified as stakeholders and the relationships between them. Benefits from the systemic framework analysis 
employing the SSM were found in this study. Using SSM could make clear the crucial factor that needs to be taken 
into account when executing a decision-making mechanism after multi-actor mapping and other variables. To find the 
most appropriate sustainability framework based on corporate sustainability performance in the fiber cement business, 
future study must employ a multi-criteria decision-making method.

Abstract 
Some cities in Latin America seek to solve their environmental pollution difficulties using electric mobility solutions. 
One of the most important questions when applying electric mobility solutions is whether these types of equipment 
will survive the life period provided by the manufacturers due to the conditions of the Andes Mountains.  
In this context, with the objective of to developing an interface that allows monitoring of the operating conditions of 
the equipment and its particular symptoms of degradation, based on an FMECA study, an instrumentation and 
indicator selection model is presented in this paper of operational performance that will allow the monitoring and 
recording of the operation data in an experimental process that leads to failure conditions in small electric vehicles.   
The first stage of the method is the system functional analysis. We characterize vehicle systems by five subsystems: 
Electrical, Traction, Structural, Braking, and Accessories. As a result, we identified 16 critical components for vehicle 
operation. Subsequently, from literature databases, the failure rates are obtained for FMECA analysis. As a result of 
the FMECA analysis, we got the critical conditions, and the variables of interest were associated with these conditions. 
In this way, it is possible to characterize the variables of interest for real-time state-of-health monitoring of the relevant 
components. Finally, we made a fault diagnosis interface and selected an instrument system with the sensitivity and 
robustness necessary for real-time monitoring.

Abstract 
The main focus of the industry in the 21st century is sustainability and customers. On a world scale, plastic produces 
a large carbon footprint during the process of producing to become plastic pellets. Biodegradable plastic is a 
sustainable solution to this environmental problem. Unfortunately, sustainable products tend to have high production 
costs. Lean manufacturing has been proven to provide advantages for manufacturing companies in the form of 
eliminating waste to increase product value and customer satisfaction. Value stream mapping (VSM) is an important 
tool of the lean approach and is used to identify and reduce activities that do not add value. Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA) is a systematic method for evaluating the environmental burden associated with a product, process, or activity, 
by identifying and measuring the energy and materials consumed and the waste released into the environment. This 
study aims to implement the concepts of lean manufacturing and life cycle assessment at the gate-to-gate stage in the 
biodegradable plastics industry to reduce cycle time and environmental impact to cut production costs therefore 
products can be sold at lower prices. In this paper, various aspects closely related to lean manufacturing are analyzed 
and reviewed, such as business process reengineering (BPR), layout optimization, machine automation, line balancing, 
and increased capacity. The results showed that the combination of VSM and LCA with simulation is a good 
alternative in making decisions to reduce cycle time and environmental impact on the Biodegradable Plastics Industry.

1. Introduction
Based on Indonesian Marine Debris Monitoring document published by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry 
(KLHK) (2017), shows that marine debris in Indonesia is dominated by plastic waste by 41% of the total composition 
of marine waste in Indonesia. This can be shown in Figure 1. As reported by ScienceMag, the increase in the amount 
of plastic waste from 1950 to 2015 has increased by 190 times, with an average increase of 5.8 tons per year. According 
to the World Economic Forum in The New Plastic Economy, Rethinking the Future of Plastic, the ratio of fish in the 
ocean to plastic will be 1:3 in 2025.

process are motion, over-processing, and defect. This non-value-added activities frequency can be reduced by 
increasing the capacity of the hot mix tank. The same thing happened in the cold mix process. However, because the 
cold mix process does not use heat, this process can be eliminated by installing an automatic mixer and weighing 
machine, namely the dosing unit on the extrusion feeder. In addition, the distance from the cold mix process to the 
extruder process is very far. This can result in high delivery times. This type of waste is classified as transport waste. 
This wastage can be reduced by layout optimization. In addition, by improving the hot mix process, the delivery 
process which was originally 600 kg per pallet can be increased to 1 ton per pallet. In the vacuum packing process, 
there is a type of waiting waste. The vacuum output is smaller than the extruder output. This is due to the manual 
vibrator process in the vacuum packing process. Therefore, it is necessary to apply line balancing, namely balancing 
the line between the extruder process and the vacuum process. The material coming out of the extrusion is immediately 
packed using a vacuum mall and vibrated with an automatic vibrator. The future state is mapped using VSM. Figure 
7 is showing VSM after implementing lean manufacturing. 
 
 
 
Figure 7. VSM after implementing lean manufacturing 
 
The difference in the total cycle time can be shown in the hot mix process which previously required 285.25 hours, 
reduced to 22.84 hours. In the cold mix process, from the previous process which required 123.12 hours it was reduced 
to 0 hours. In the extruder process, the previous process which required 146 hours, was reduced to 134 hours. The 
packing process, which previously process which required 165 hours, was reduced to 108.9 hours. This reduction in 
cycle time is directly proportional to the reduction in electricity usage. Before applying lean manufacturing, the 
electricity used to fulfill a sales order of 33,000 kg was 25,343 kWh, whereas after implementing lean manufacturing 
it was reduced to 12,521 kWh. It is also directly proportional to the amount of CO2 emissions. Before implementing 
lean manufacturing, the CO2 emissions generated to fulfill a 33,000 kg order were 20,756 kg CO2/kWh, whereas after 
implementing lean manufacturing it was reduced to 10,254 kg CO2/kWh. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The environmental impact caused by the manufacturing industry has started forcing organizations to expand their 
performance metrics from economic to environmental aspects. Thus, sustainability and lean become benchmarks for 
the manufacturing sector. Changing stakeholder requirements, global competition, and pressure to integrate

Abstract 
In recent centuries, the rate of water consumption has more than doubled and the Industrial population growth rate has 
continued to increase. As a result, water scarcity has now become one of the main problems that must be faced locally 
in Indonesia. In particular, Bekasi Regency is the largest industrial city in Indonesia and the largest in Southeast Asia 
with 11 industrial areas with 7,000 factories that have a very large need for water  for industry. 
Given such a dilemma, this study aims to develop a dynamic system model to evaluate a water management system 
in one of the Integrated Industrial City in Bekasi Regency. The focus is on the following two issues: (1) Policies that 
can be taken to reduce water demand of Integrated Industrial city in Bekasi area; (2) Model simulation the Impact of 
wastewater recycle to water demand and water supply of Integrated Industrial City Bekasi Regency. 
One of the long-term steps and policies to prevent a water crisis that needs to be considered is how to use wastewater 
from factories or tenants in the industrial area to be recycled into raw water again, so that it can help meet the raw 
water supply needs for the industrial area. With a dynamic system simulation, it can be proven whether the water 
management is sensitive to the reuse/recycle of wastewater is important in this study. Simulating a water demand and 
supply based on Industrial area growing rate Integrated Industrial City in Bekasi Regency also important in this study.

1. Introduction
Today's technology is very important. The reason is, with the rapid advancement of technology, it can increase 
effectiveness and efficiency in increasing productivity and high competitiveness. However, this can indirectly affect the 
practice of human resource management within the organization. Where, of course, this will be related to the large 
demands of work that force companies to have reliable and professional human resources (HR) in their fields. 
The Covid-19 outbreak has also changed the way office workers work. Office workers can carry out all their work 
activities from home, it turns out that this kind of work model is usually done by some workers. Call it the workers On 
Demand Worker. Trends or work models like this continue to develop over time because they are balanced by current, 
up-to-date technological developments. 
It is estimated that by 2025, one-third of all workers in the world will find work through digital platforms (Standing, 
2016). Meanwhile worldwide, the number of people who find work through job search platforms is estimated at more 
than 70 million (Heeks 2017). According to data released in a 2015 study by McKinsey, up to 540 million people will 
benefit from job search platforms by 2025. As many as 230 million people find new jobs faster and can reduce the duration 
of unemployment, while 200 million are inactive or working. part-timers can earn additional hours via the On Demand 
Job platform. 
There are issues with the study in this case study, including: (a) there is an increase in freelance workers (On Demand 
Workers) in 2022 of 3.33% (BPS, February 2022); (b) there are 100.4 million workers whose pay or salary is below the 
minimum standard (BPS February, 2022); (c) the most unemployed age group is at the age of 20-24 years, namely 2.54 
million people, where this group is of productive age which is the largest number of internet users in Indonesia; (d) many 
companies are demanding to get reliable and professional employees in their fields.

Abstract 
Inventory management is an important process in which companies plan, organize and control the goods produced, 
based on techniques and tools such as demand analysis and production planning and control. This article presents a 
bibliometric analysis based on inventory management. The proposed methodology is based on the information 
obtained from Scopus databases, raises and provides answers to six (6) questions, through a descriptive, thematic, 
collaborative and interrelated analysis, using computer supports such as VosViewers and Bibliometrix - Biblioshiny. 
The findings identified a positive trend in the volume of annual publications, highlighting the interest of the scientific 
and academic community in this area of knowledge. The results also allowed the identification of relevant topics 
grouped by cluster and the future research perspective, oriented to the solution of problems framed in modeling, 
stochastic process analysis, application of metaheristical algorithms and product design.

1. Introduction
Inventory management is a critical process in manufacturing companies. It consists of the planning, organization and 
control of tangible products, involving storage, material handling, follow-up and control actions. The main objective 
is to maximize the value of the company, satisfy demand and minimize storage costs. In the manufacturing industry, 
companies particularly have inventories, from the arrival of raw materials, during the production process and in the 
output of finished goods, therefore an inadequate management can lead to failure (Longenecker, J. et al. 2010). 
According to Osorio, C. (2013), inventories also arise from the gap between consumer demand and the production or 
supply of these products. Inventory management is a process of vital importance in the operationalization of any 
company; it involves activities related to the planning, control and efficient and effective storage of goods, with the 
objective of generating adequate levels of customer service to (Vidal, G. et al. 2019). According to Vidal, G. H. et al. 
(2019) are activities of transcendental importance for the fulfillment of the objectives of a company, especially in the 
manufacturing industry. Allowing not to have risks of having excess or missing units (Osorio C. 2013). On the other 
hand, Valencia, M. et al. (2015) establishes that good inventory management provides security with respect to 
fluctuations in demand. 
For the analysis of the topic ""Inventory management"", bibliometric studies are used to obtain measurable results from 
scientific production (Tague-Sutcliffe J. 1992). According to Sancho, R. (1990), they provide an orientation based on 
advances and approaches. Taking information included in the documents, specifically in titles, abstracts, context and 
sources, considering elements such as authors, words, affiliations, journals, countries and indicators such as citations, 
citations and impact factors of publications. The essence of the study should be based on statistical techniques, which 
lead to a panoramic view of the main trends and the scope of a set of documents (Broadus R. 1987), as well as the 
analysis of collaborative relationships (Donthu N. et al. 2021) and the evolution of research (Valtakoski A. 2019).  
In this regard, Ye, Y. & Ge, Y. (2018) developed a bibliometric analysis of inventory management research based on 
knowledge mapping. In a time horizon from 1986 to 2017 by exploring Web of Science (WOS) database and applying 
CiteSpace and VOSviewer computational tools. More recently, Lumban, F. et al. (2022), worked from the Scopus 
database an analysis focused on inventory control under the machine learning approach. The bibliometric analysis 
takes some aspects of the analysis, namely: the number of annual publications in the journal, the largest number of

Figure 8 shows the evolution of the research axis and the trend in a time horizon. It is evident in the last years (2021-
2023), that inventory management is oriented to the solution of problems framed in the modeling, control and 
information of manufacturing systems and supply chains, considering approaches of simulation and optimization 
models, metaheuristic algorithms, forecasting techniques, production design and Markov chains.

4. Conclusion
This research investigates the Scopus databases in search of a bibliometric analysis on the thematic axis inventory 
management, during a period of time from 2000 to 2022. It is worth noting that during the first decade (2000 to 2010) 
209 papers were published, representing 26.26% of the publications, being this a less productive period; unlike the 
last twelve (12) years which reflects 73.74% represented in 587 papers, evidencing a period of higher production. The 
trend line clearly highlights the interest of the scientific and academic community in this area of knowledge. Regarding 
the volume of citations, it is notorious in first position the author ""Cachon G. P."" ""Fisher M."" with 1243 Citations, 
affiliated to University of Pennsylvania, and research potential in areas of stochastic modeling; Analytical 
optimization and supply chain management, respectively. According to the list of journals, ""Management Science"" 
600","Proceedings of the 4th South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Conference, Lima, Peru, May 9-11, 2023 
© IEOM Society International 
stands out with 2635 citations. This is followed by ""International Journal of Production Economics"" with 2126 
citations. Using the VosViewer software, the most cited articles, the co-citations between the different authors, the co-
occurrence from the keywords and the co-authorship by means of the collaborative component were evidenced. Being 
notorious the appearance of several main authors regarding the volume of scientific production and cited articles, with 
research inclination related to stochastic systems and models; planning, programming and control; costs of ordering, 
storing and ordering; materials management, product identification and logistic information systems; inventory levels 
and policies; and total cost optimization. An analysis by means of the Bibliometrix with Biblioshiny computer support, 
evidences the evolution of the subject and the future perspective, being this one oriented to the solution of problems 
framed in the modeling, control and information of manufacturing systems and supply chains, considering approaches 
of simulation and optimization models, metaheuristic algorithms, forecasting techniques, product design and markov 
chains.

Abstract 
Currently it is necessary for companies to identify and become aware of their actions that impact the environment, 
since nothing can be developed in isolation. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the company to identify and evaluate 
the practices that represent a threat to its prosperity. The objective of this work is to propose corporate social 
responsibility actions for a consulting services company as support for the application of NOM-035, whose purpose 
is to prevent psychosocial risk factors in workers, through a methodology of the type qualitative, documentary, 
descriptive and exploratory with a non-experimental and cross-sectional design which allows deepening the object of 
study through the review of the main reference sources on Corporate Social Responsibility, as well as the authors who 
have previously worked the topic. For the above, surveys were applied based on the reference guide II of NOM-035-
STPS-2018 to 130 employees, which allowed determining the relevant psychosocial risk factors for the design of a 
proposal of actions to incorporate Responsibility. Social Entrepreneurship that involves the application of NOM-035.

1. Introduction
This research offers a proposal for Corporate Social Responsibility actions, which support compliance with NOM-
035-STPS-2018 (NOM-035) in a consulting services company in order to identify and prevent psychosocial risk
factors in the organization. The proposal is aimed to directors, managers and/or workers, empowered to make
decisions, as well as researchers who address occupational health issues in relation to Corporate Social Responsibility.
Psychosocial risks such as work stress, are among the problems that most affect people's health, leading to problems 
such as heart disease, digestive disorders, increased blood pressure, headaches, anxiety, among others, according to 
the International Labor Organization (2016), 75% of Mexicans suffered from fatigue due to work stress associated 
with 25% of the 75,000 heart attacks registered per year, which places Mexico in first place in the world in work 
stress, due to the above that the adoption of Corporate Social Responsibility practices in organizations allows the 
working environment to be improved, organizational commitment to increase, staff turnover to decrease and 
productivity to increase, through the development of good practices that protect human rights and labor, promote 
equality, safety at work, the elimination of discrimination, act ethically and maintain a relationship with stakeholders, 
the environment and society. For this reason, the research becomes relevant for consulting SMEs by offering a vision 
of Corporate Social Responsibility to comply with the obligation to prevent psychosocial risk factors, since the 
incorporation of triple action practices allows them to improve their sustainability value. Therefore, the proposal 
consists of three phases that integrate Corporate Social Responsibility actions for the prevention or reduction of 
psychosocial risks in the entire staff of a consulting company, in the same way NOM-035 is complied with and they 
highlight the benefits and importance of adopting actions under the premise of sustainable development. 
1.1 Objective 
Propose corporate social responsibility actions in a consulting services company to support the application of NOM-
035 in order to prevent psychosocial risk factors in workers.

6. Conclusion  
The relationship between the Official Mexican Standard 035 and Corporate Social Responsibility suggests addressing 
the negative impacts on human rights, promoting the physical, mental, and social health of workers, generating a 
favorable work environment, mitigating acts of violence and discrimination and providing tools to correctly carry out 
the activities and establish an assertive means of communication. 
 
Likewise, compliance with regulations and legislation are part of Corporate Social Responsibility, however, 
compliance with NOM-035 is the obligation of all companies and addressing it from a CSR management represents 
an opportunity to evaluate, measure and improve internal practices, increase productivity, reduce absenteeism and 
offer better service to customers. On the other hand, when CSR is defined as a communication tool that helps to 
generate transparency inside and outside organizations, its application not only generates benefits for the organization, 
but also for interest groups, such as strengthening the ability to recruit and retain better employees, business reputation, 
strengthening the relationship with the community, and strengthening the loyalty of its customers, among other 
benefits that would help improve the current status of the company ""AxC Consultores"", however, the practice of CSR 
should not be limited to the support of NOM-035, despite the fact that consulting service companies in Mexico need 
highly trained, motivated and health professionals in all aspects to grow economically, the practice must respond to 
the evaluation of the potential, positive and negative impacts that your business activities have throughout your entire 
value chain.

Abstract 
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has received increasing attention in recent years. AI has been used 
to enhance personalized learning, feedback, and student evaluation. However, there are challenges and limitations 
associated with its use, such as the quality of data used and the need for training and skill development for educators 
and students. In the last 5 years, there has been an exponential increase in interest in the use of AI in education, and 
the top 20 cited articles cover a wide range of topics related to the application of AI in education. One area of focus is 
the use of AI in early prediction of academic failure. AI can help identify students at risk of dropping out of school by 
analyzing large amounts of data such as grades, attendance, classroom behavior, and other factors that may affect 
academic performance. In conclusion, AI offers great potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
teaching-learning process in education by providing personalized and adaptive feedback to students, provided that the 
challenges and limitations are effectively addressed and transparency and ethics in its use are ensured. AI can be a 
valuable tool to improve education and prepare students for the future.

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that has revolutionized many fields, including education. AI is increasingly 
being used in the classroom to provide personalized learning experiences and improve administrative efficiency. AI 
can be used to analyze and process large amounts of student data and provide personalized feedback on their learning 
progress, adapting course content to individual student needs. It can also significantly improve students' academic 
performance by providing personalized learning experiences. Additionally, AI can be used to automate administrative 
tasks, allowing educators to focus on teaching and interacting with students. 
However, there are challenges and limitations in the use of AI in education. One of the main challenges is the quality 
of data used by AI. If the data is inaccurate or biased, this can negatively impact the accuracy of learning 
recommendations and feedback provided to students. There are also concerns about the privacy and security of student 
data, especially in relation to the use of machine learning technologies. Additionally, the use of AI in education raises 
ethical and social issues. A study published in the Ethics and Information Technology journal highlighted that the use 
of AI in education may widen the equity gap among students, as students who have access to advanced AI technologies 
may have an advantage over those who do not (Bostrom and Yudkowsky 2014). There are also concerns about the 
impact of AI on the role of the educator and interpersonal interaction in the classroom.

Artificial Intelligence offers great potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the teaching and learning 
process in education, by providing personalized and adaptive feedback to students. 
 
Despite the challenges and limitations presented by the implementation of artificial intelligence in education, it is 
important to effectively address them to ensure its proper and ethical use. 
 
Artificial intelligence can improve accessibility to education for people with disabilities and marginalized 
communities, by offering personalized and adaptive solutions that fit their specific needs. 
 
A balanced and critical approach is necessary in implementing artificial intelligence in education, to ensure that 
educators and students understand the benefits and limits of this technology and can use it effectively to improve the 
teaching-learning process.

Abstract 
This paper presents alternatives for the implementation of a Market Place called “Clic”, considering the technological 
infrastructure necessary for its operation based on Machine Learning algorithms. During the elaboration of this paper, 
surveys were conducted to both users qualified as ""Clients"" and ""Professionals"" about the intentionality of use and the 
probability of payment for the publication of their services in the platform. This paper presents the recommended steps 
for the composition of the Clic company, the way the information is collected for Machine Learning and the data 
obtained from the users, the recommended environments for the development of the application, the results of the 
surveys carried out, the feasibility of the Machine Learning algorithm, numerical data of financial feasibility for the 
execution of the project.

1. Introduction
In Peru, there is still no web-based portal of professionals and technicians that allows direct contact with customers 
who need services ranging from psychological care, math classes, legal guidance or even requesting home repairs.  
For this reason, the present research describes a technological solution for a Marketplace where a search can be made 
among options of professionals, comparing prices and qualifications, making the payment online and coordinating the 
attention of the service in a virtual way. Likewise, the Marketplace ""Clic"" referred to above, will allow professionals 
to have greater visibility and opportunity to offer their services in a reliable, safe and easy way. The functioning of 
the Marketplace will be powered by preference algorithms that use machine learning to make personalized 
recommendations for both clients and professionals considering aspects such as score, location, need or interest.  
The importance of this project is that it can help reduce the unemployment gap in metropolitan Lima, currently 
estimated at 443,600 people and increase the income of professionals according to the (INEI - National Institute of 
Statistics and Informatics 2023).

6. Conclusion  
After the investigations carried out, it can be concluded that the technology is available to perform the service sought 
by Clic for both Professionals and User using applications such as Google Firebase as the core of the service. It is also 
evident that there is labor in the market (professionals), who would use the service to attract customers in a faster and 
digital way by publishing the ad, as well as there is a market for such professionals who would register and allow a 
percentage commission for the execution of such service.  
As there is no holistic and popularized service like Clic's currently in the peruvian market, continuous flexibility and 
specialization would be done to the marketplace as it increases in demand and market share and new jobs could be 
considered for the company, even an exit or the acquisition of other outsourced services, etc.

Abstract 
This paper seeks to identify the various applications of lean strategies in food companies through a systematic review 
of the literature between 2017 and 2021, since many authors affirm that the application of these strategies improves 
the efficiency of the process by eliminating waste and operations that do not generate added value. 
According to the findings, a significant proportion of the retrieved articles (62%) are from European countries that 
address issues pertaining to sustainability, cost reduction, and waste management. This observation highlights the 
importance and focus of European countries towards adopting sustainable practices and reducing their ecological 
footprint. The prevalence of articles on this topic suggests that there is a growing interest in the region to develop 
innovative and practical solutions to environmental challenges. It also underscores the need for greater collaboration 
and knowledge-sharing among countries to foster sustainable development and reduce global environmental impact. 
The strategies found with broader applicability were lean six sigma, 5S and VSM.

1. Introduction
The concept of the term Lean encompasses a series of activities or solutions aimed at eliminating waste and non-
value-added operations. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the first to use the term; however, it was the 
Japanese who initiated this production system. The latter created this system with the aim of reducing waste and 
optimizing resources (Manzouri et al. 2014). 
The application of lean techniques and tools allows companies to become more profitable and flexible, as these tools 
satisfy customer demand on the highest possible level by reducing waste, taking into account human resource 
selections, design, production processes, and inventory or distribution activities, therefore, companies invest in 
implementing lean practices to remain competitive (Manzouri et al. 2014). 
(ONU, 2015) 
According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Plan for 2030 (2015), ending hunger by providing enough 
safe, affordable, and nutritious food and reducing food waste from production to consumption are two key objectives 
for the well-being of humanity and the planet conservation. Sustainable food waste management operations are

1. Introduction
1.1. Lean Manufacturing
The Toyota Production System (TPS) provided the basis for what is now known as lean thinking. This approach to
manufacturing began after the Second World War by Taiichi Ohno in the Toyota Motor Company because of capital
and resource shortages. Eiji Toyoda instructed his workers to eliminate all waste, which was defined as ""Anything
other than the minimum amount of equipment, materials, parts, space and time which are absolutely necessary to add
value to the product. (Guleria et al. 2022).
Lean Manufacturing is considered an improvement philosophy in which the main objective is to eliminate or reduce
waste to reduce the Lead Time of the manufacturing processes. Waste is categorized as follows:
1) MUDA: Refers to the eight forms of waste: over-production, defects, inventory, overprocessing,
transportation, waiting, motion, and human talent.
2) MURA: Refers to all non-scheduled changes made to the production schedule that generate non-value-
added activities.
3) MURI: Includes all the poor manufacturing station designs that result in operator fatigue, increasing the
manufacturing lead time.
1.2. Six Sigma 
Six Sigma was developed at Motorola by Bill Smith in the 1980’s. Six sigma can be considered a philosophy or set of 
techniques with the purpose of improving business and manufacturing processes. Six Sigma main goal is to reduce 
the variation of the process through statistical techniques reaching a quality level of 3.4 parts per million defectives. 
Six Sigma uses the DMAIC methodology, which consists of the following stages: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve 
and Control (Surange 2015).

article was the most cited, with over 800 citations. 
It is important to mention that the trends in Lean Six Sigma papers are more focused on theoretical approaches; as 
discussed previously, only two of the most cited articles are implementations of Lean Six Sigma for improvement or 
problem-solving.

Abstract 
ECOPACAYA 4.0 is a Tourism 4.0 project carried out by an eco-lodge located in the Peruvian Amazon. The eco-
lodge has been on the market for more than fifteen years and owns a private reserve of one hundred and thirty hectares 
that shelters great biodiversity of flora and fauna. The project's objective was to facilitate the entry of the ecolodge 
into the “experience economy” by the creation of memorable experiences for its visitors through focused and 
innovative tourism products and services. In this sense, five themed routes called Eco trails (ethnobotanical, 
mythological, fauna, worldview, and an interactive game) were developed to provide visitors with expert knowledge 
about the biodiversity and culture of the area. For this purpose, an intelligent platform was designed and implemented 
using Industry 4.0 technologies such as augmented reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. 
This platform allows visitors to experience the following through mobile devices: 1.) Get automatic assistance on 
positioning while touring each Eco trail. 2.) Get an integrated view of digital information (virtual guides and 
characters) with the eco-lodge private reserve´s physical environment in real time. 3.) Online connection of visitors 
with their social networks. This posed the great challenge of implementing a complex and efficient communications 
system to make it possible for such a remote and previously unconnected area to finally get integrated into the digital 
world. Another achievement of the project is the Biodiversity Portal, a collaborative site that allows researchers, 
students, and academics to access qualified scientific information on the biodiversity of the area, thus facilitating their 
research efforts. Finally, we highlight that we are currently in the process of packaging this experience not only to 
optimize its use in the ecolodge but also to expand its use to other environments.

6. Conclusion 
ECOPACAYA 4.0 is the first platform of Tourism 4.0 in the Amazon jungle of Peru that includes an AR application, 
and a Biodiversity Portal, all supported by telecommunications infrastructure sustainable. It is an innovative and 
sustainable initiative that has the potential to revolutionize tourism in the region with a forward-thinking approach to 
tourism that prioritizes both the visitor experience and environmental conservation. 
The AR application provides visitors with an interactive and immersive experience of the Amazon jungle, enhancing 
their understanding and appreciation of the region's unique biodiversity. The Biodiversity Portal serves as a valuable 
resource for visitors, providing information about the region's flora and fauna and promoting sustainable tourism 
practices. The sustainable telecommunications infrastructure is an essential component of the platform, ensuring that 
visitors can stay connected and engaged while minimizing the environmental impact of their stay. By providing 
sustainable infrastructure, the platform helps to promote responsible tourism and minimize the negative impacts on 
the local environment. 
There are many exciting opportunities related to the implementation of the other Industry 4.0 technologies to enhance 
the tourist experience and develop new and engaging content with the creation of new AR experiences specifically 
designed for the unique environment and culture of the Amazon jungle of Peru. Always involving collaborations with 
local communities and stakeholders to ensure that the content is culturally appropriate and respectful.  
ECOPACAYA 4.0 can be integrated with other technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), artificial intelligence, and 
machine learning to enhance the tourist experience. For example, tourists could use AR technology to scan plants and 
animals and receive real-time information about them using machine learning algorithms to create even more 
immersive and educational experiences. This could involve the development of long-term monitoring programs that 
track the impact of the technology over time and identify any potential negative effects that need to be addressed and 
could serve as a model for other regions that are interested in promoting sustainable tourism practices to reach a wider 
audience.

Abstract 
Currently, there are many methodologies for the improvement of production processes documented in different 
reports. Within the engineering area, some of the most published are Six Sigma, DMAIC, Lean Six Sigma and Lean 
Manufacturing, and in recent years they have sought to improve response variables such as productivity, lead time, 
delivery time, OEE, set up time, dead time, among others. The most used lean manufacturing tools within this approach 
in recent years are 5s, VSM, SMED, standard work, Heijunka, among others. Although there are many bibliometric 
analyses of the subject, this is a topic that has a large increase in publications, so it is important to update the 
bibliometric analysis. This article reports a bibliometric analysis of lean manufacturing for process improvement and 
an analysis of 62 documents found in the Scopus and ScienceDirect databases using the PRISMA methodology chosen 
for showing the response variable and the tools used in its methodology. The results indicate that Peru, Portugal, India 
and the United States are the countries with the most publications on this approach, with the Peruvian University of 
Applied Sciences standing out as the institute with the most publications. The most productive authors on this topic 
are Ferreira, L.P., Silva, F.J.G. and Sá, J.C. Finally, the journals that publish the most on this topic are International 
Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, International Journal Of Lean Six Sigma and International Journal 
of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage.

Abstract 
This study was conducted to determine the interest in using financial technology (fintech) peer to peer lending (p2p 
lending) in MSMEs. The model used is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) which is to see the successful 
application of information technology and the variables used are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, 
and attitudes towards user interest in using financial technology (fintech) peer to peer lending (p2p lending). The 
data used in this study are primary data with the data collection method using a questionnaire. Then the data analysis 
method used is SEMPLS with the help of SmartPLS software. In this study, the number of samples or respondents 
who filled out and returned the questionnaire were 64 respondents. The results of this study indicate that perceived 
ease of use has a significant effect on perceived usefulness, perceived usefulness has a significant effect on trust, 
trust has a significant effect on attitude, and attitude has a significant effect on user interest. The finding in this study 
is that perceived ease of use does not have a significant effect on trust. Suggestions for further research are to add 
variables not examined in this study such as security, risk, etc. And the findings in this study can be reviewed so that 
it can be seen whether they get the same or different results from this study.

1. Introduction
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are one of the most important pillars in the Indonesian economy
with the current number reaching 64.2 million with a contribution to GDP of 61.07%, then the Indonesian economy
covers 97% of the total workforce and collects up to 60.4% of the total investment. However, the high number of
MSMEs in Indonesia cannot be separated from the challenges that exist(Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs
of the Republic of Indonesia 2021).
MSMEs still face many problems, one of which is financing or venture capital. The challenge of finding sources of
funding for MSMEs in Indonesia has long been a well-known issue(Sartika et al. 2019). As many as 74% of

role in a person's life.(Hurlock 2002). A person's behavior is usually influenced by the level of interest in the activity 
if the interest is high, then the results of his actions will also be high, and vice versa. The link between interest and 
behavior means that before someone does an activity, there is interest. This interest may reflect a good or bad 
attitude. 
 
Influence Perceived Usefulness (Usability) Against Interest in User (User Interest) 
The results of hypothesis 9 testing show that hypothesis 9 is not proven or rejected. The test results show 
thatperceived usefulness(usefulness) has no significant effect on interest in user (user interest). This result is 
supported by the T statistical value of perceived usefulness for interest in the user, which is 0.769 <1.645. Then for 
the value of P Values of perceived usefulness (usefulness) of the interest in the user (user interest) is0.221 > 0.05. 
Therefore, based on the results of the hypothesis stated thatperceived usefulness(usefulness) has a negative effect on 
interest in user (user interest). This finding is supported by research conducted by Dwi Marchelina and Raisa Pratiwi 
(2018) which states that Perceived Usefulness has a negative effect on Interest in Users. The results of this test also 
reject the theory from Juanda (2020) that perceived benefit is the extent to which a technology system can provide 
benefits to those who use it, the more useful a technology system is, of course, it also affects the number of users 
using the technology system (Juanda 2020). 
 
6. Conclusions  
Based on the results of the discussion regarding the factors that influence the level of MSME confidence in using 
fintech using the technology acceptance model (TAM), in this case it can be concluded that: 
1. Hypothesis 1 testing shows that perceived ease of use has a positive effect on the perceived usefulness of p2p 
Lending Fintech. This shows that MSME users or activists view that Fintech which is easy to use will provide 
benefits or benefits to them as MSME actors. 
2. Hypothesis 2 testing shows that perceived ease of use has a negative effect on trust in P2p Lending Fintech. This 
shows that MSME users or activists view that even though P2p Lending Fintech is easy to use, they have not been 
able to fully trust P2p Lending Fintech. 
3. Hypothesis 3 testing shows that perceived usefulness has a positive effect on p2p Lending Fintech trust. This shows 
that MSME users or activists view that P2p Lending Fintech has provided benefits or benefits to them as MSME 
actors which also makes them believe in P2p Lending Fintech. 
4. Hypothesis 4 testing shows that perceived ease of use has an effect on P2p Lending Fintech attitudes. This shows 
that MSME users or activists in P2p Lending Fintech feel the ease of using the system the first time they use it, so it 
creates a positive attitude towards the system. 
5. Hypothesis 5 testing shows that trust has a positive effect on the attitude of P2P Lending Fintech. This shows that 
the trust of MSME users or activists in P2P Lending Fintech makes their behavior also change in a positive direction 
towards the existence of P2P Lending Fintech. The positive attitude in question is that they show a good attitude 
towards the presence of P2P Lending Fintech. 
6. Hypothesis 6 testing shows that perceived usefulness has a negative effect on p2p Lending Fintech attitudes. This 
shows that MSME users or activists in P2p Lending Fintech do not want to use a technology because they feel that a 
system is not able to provide benefits and value for them. 
7. Hypothesis 7 testing shows that perceived ease of use has a negative effect on interest in users of p2p Lending 
FinTech. This shows that MSME users or activists find it difficult to use the system so that users are reluctant to use 
the technology system, because they feel preoccupied with learning and it is difficult to use it. 
8. Hypothesis 8 testing shows that attitude has a positive effect on interest in users of p2p Lending FinTech. This 
shows that the good attitude shown by MSME users or activists towards the presence of P2p Lending Fintech affects 
their interest. They become interested in continuing to use p2p Lending Fintech in the future. 
9. Hypothesis 9 testing shows that perceived usefulness has a positive effect on interest in users of p2p Lending 
FinTech. This shows that MSME users or activists will have p2p Lending Fintech not provide benefits to them so 
that it will also affect the number of people who use the technology system.

Abstract 
Material handling is one of the essential activities of the production process in the original equipment manufacturing 
organization. Layout design that is not efficient, creates distance route that is also not efficient. This situation causes 
longer time to supply and retractation of materials and working parts from and to warehouse. While layout design 
itself contributes to 10% to 30% of operational cost, hence a good layout is something that needs to be pursued. With 
the increase of demand in automotive industry in Indonesia and the competition is getting fierce like never before 
automotive manufacture organization has to retain and gain their competitive advantages. This research has the 
objective to improve current layout of one of the biggest OEM companies in Indonesia where their main products are 
alternator and starter. Systematic Layout Planning is used in this research that studies the intercorrelation between 
facilities not only the proximity of each facility but also the relevance of one facility to others. The sustainability 
aspect of this research is studied on how the change of the distance of material handling route could affect the energy 
usage of the electric hand pallet and the life cycle of the particular equipment. The improved layout shows that the 
distance route is shorter, and the energy used is smaller.

1. Introduction (12 font)
The facts show that an economy based on extraction can generate a lot of economic income in the short term, but in 
the medium and long term, generate depredation of the forest, social problems, poverty and underdevelopment, with 
continuous deforestation of natural forests, and increasing loss of wealth of natural resources, consequently, as we can 
see Figure: 1. 
This same model is the one that prevails in the 21st century, because of that, the world has been experiencing crisis in 
many fronts, a systemic collapse, which imposes a challenge on humanity, for a global reset. In this sense, (Gomà R., 
2022) Exposes on Policies of proximity, urban collective action and construction of the common, at the XV AECPA 
Congress. On the other hand, there are other initiatives to advance Climate Action (Global Pact Red Chile, 2020), 
through a global pact with 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), for the sustainability of the planet.

4.2. Validation  
Profit. (Table: 1) all the Marginal Benefits (Figure: 5 and 9) that are generated by the Marginal Investment in an ATA 
(Figure: 11), have been evaluated and projected. Carbon sequestration (Figure: 12) and biomass production of 24 
hectares of natural forest are ensured, rescuing them from predation and degradation. The marginal benefits are at 
least 120 tons/year of CO2 captured (Figure: 12), 348 tons/year of oxygen generated and 288 tons/year are permanently 
purified. In addition, a production of 120 tons/year ecological, organic, unique, different and high-value products 
(biomass) are collected from the Amazon. It should be noted that if that 24hec. of forest are cut down, all previous is 
lost forever, in addition, at least 2,400 tons of CO2 (Figure: 10) are emitted and all the negative impacts and effects 
of soil degradation that this entails. Other marginal benefits, source of work, knowledge, research, study, better quality 
of life for everyone in the world. Place to live, meet and enjoy. A place to invest sustainably in freedom, life and 
prosperity. An opportunity to generate a sustainable investment model, whose growth is mainly driven and maintained 
by nature. 
5. Conclusion  
Purpose. Mission of this research was fulfilled, by providing knowledge, which will contribute to improving the lives 
of people in the world, the Problem is how to achieve the Vision of this research ""The sustainable development of 
people in harmony with the planet”. Achieving SSBM (Strategic Sustainably Business Model) is a solution to the 
General Problem. Which was applied to the Central Problem of how? take advantage of the Potential of the Amazon 
to solve the Problem of mitigating global warming and contributing to the sustainable development of the planet. As 
a result, the ATA System was exposed. Thus, progress was made in two key milestones (SSBM and ATA System) 
towards the Mission to achieve the Vision of this investigation. 
General problem. How to Evaluate the Referential Strategic Sustainably Business Model (SSBM)?, was resolved, 
starting from the Theoretical Basis of the Balance of living matter - energy - matter, throughout the Life Cycle of the

Abstract 
As one of the countries in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is making an energy transition in the transportation sector by 
using battery-based electric vehicles (BEV). The Indonesian government supports accelerating electric car use by 
issuing Presidential Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 55 of 2019 concerning the Battery-Based Electric 
Motorized Vehicle Acceleration Program. The level of consumers buying electric cars is still low due to a lack of 
awareness about several aspects, including the economy, benefits, accessibility, and environmental concern. On the 
other hand, the relatively expensive purchase price of electric cars is a consideration or even an obstacle for people to 
switch to using electric cars. This study aims to understand which factors hinder the adoption of electric cars in DKI 
Jakarta. Using questionnaire method with probability sampling and cluster sampling research techniques based on 
cities in DKI Jakarta Province. Electric vehicle prices, infrastructure, and policies are the most important factors 
hindering electric car adoption in DKI Jakarta.

1. Introduction
The Paris Agreement, issued in 2015, aims to reduce emission levels. The growth rate of greenhouse gas emissions in 
Southeast Asia is second only to South Asia (Aleluia et al. 2022). The Indonesian government supports the acceleration 
of electric car use by issuing Presidential Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 55 of 2019 concerning the 
battery-based electric motorized vehicle acceleration program (Presiden Republik Indonesia, 2019). The electric car 
market’s ratio is still low compared to its planned usage and popularity (Tu and Yang 2019). The level of consumers 
buying electric cars is still low due to a lack of awareness about several aspects, including the economy, benefits, 
accessibility, and environmental concern (Almansour 2022).  
On the other hand, the relatively expensive purchase price of electric cars is a consideration or even an obstacle for 
people to switch to using electric cars (Febransyah 2021). For example, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 released in Indonesia in 
2022 (Waskita 2022) has a price of IDR 748,000,000 for the lowest type and IDR 859,000,000 for the highest type 
(PT. Hyundai Mobil Indonesia 2022). Based on (Kurniawan 2022), the purchasing power of cars in DKI Jakarta is 
around IDR 300 million. Comparing the number of cars purchased with prices around IDR 300 million, the  Toyota 
All New Veloz (ICEV) of 7,626 units and the Wuling Air EV (BEV) of 4,799 units in 2022 (Gaikindo 2022). Based 
on the comparison, the number of conventional car sales is greater than the number of electric cars at the same price. 
It assumes that people prefer conventional cars over electric cars. 
Previous research on electric vehicles was not specified in the DKI Jakarta area but is common throughout Indonesia. 
In addition, research only focuses on vehicle prices and existing policies without looking at external factors such as 
people's perspectives on electric cars. (Nizliandry 2020) discusses the cost of tax incentives, (Utami et al. 2022) discuss 
the implementation of electric vehicle policies to support energy security, (Marciano 2021) compare policies in several 
developed countries with existing policies in Indonesia, and (Prawesti 2022) discusses government efforts to address 
environmental issues through electric vehicles. The study (Raman et al. 2022) refers to the charging infrastructure. 
Therefore, this research is needed to understand which factors hinder the adoption of electric cars in DKI Jakarta.

The research questionnaire uses a Likert scale of 1 to 4. Where a value of 1 means strongly disagree, 2 means disagree, 
3 means agree, and 4 means strongly agree. Seven questions were generated based on the indicators used, including 
costs, awareness of the environment, technology, infrastructure, and policies. 
Sixty-one respondents stated that the price of electric cars is still relatively high in contrast to the cost of fuel for 
electric cars, whereas 58 respondents stated that the cost of electric cars was relatively low. In the environmental 
awareness indicator, 65 respondents in DKI Jakarta want to reduce the pollution produced by their vehicles, and 60 
respondents are aware that using an electric car is environmentally friendly. Fifty-eight respondents stated that the 
technology contained in electric cars was good. Based on 59 respondents, the supporting infrastructure for electric 
cars in DKI Jakarta could be better. According to 44 respondents, the policy regarding electric cars in DKI Jakarta is 
still considered unfavorable. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Indonesian government supports accelerating electric car use by issuing Presidential Regulation of the Republic 
of Indonesia Number 55 of 2019 concerning the Battery-Based Electric Motorized Vehicle Acceleration Program. On 
the other hand, the level of consumers buying electric cars is still low due to a lack of awareness about several aspects, 
including the economy, benefits, accessibility, and environmental concern. Moreover, the relatively expensive 
purchase price of electric cars is a consideration or even an obstacle for people to switch to using electric cars. Using 
data collected from a few electric car manufacturers, we can see that the usual family car (Nissan Leaf and Hyundai 
Ioniq 5) costs twice the purchasing power of DKI Jakarta people. Based on the questionnaire distributed, the most 
hindering factor for people in DKI Jakarta was prices, followed by supporting infrastructure and regulations.

Abstract 
Gamification is a new methodology that is used mainly in education and marketing, however, in recent years it has 
become more relevant in the training of personnel at a professional level. The objective of this literature review was 
to make a synthesis and analyze the cases of gamification implementation in training both at a professional level and 
at a level of student practices. The following review was based on the PRISMA model, studies were delimited by 
inclusion criteria, and finally, after discarding articles, 39 studies remained for analysis. The results of this 
investigation determined that gamification is an innovative way of training that promotes growth, the development of 
competences and teamwork. Likewise, it was evidenced that gamification was implemented more in the field of 
medicine and there is a gap of knowledge of the implementation of gamification in other professional areas.

1. Introduction
Despite living in an era where the mechanization of processes is observed in almost any industrial field, human 
resources still continue to be a key element in organizations, reflected as a competitive advantage over others (Llanos 
2016). Currently, companies focus on proper personnel management, improvement of the work environment, and 
skills that allow autonomy in decision-making and problem-solving, as job satisfaction has been shown to be directly 
linked to productivity and organizational commitment (Peña et al. 2015). However, all this would not be possible 
without good management of the human resources area, responsible for activities such as recruitment, selection, 
training, or performance evaluation (Ascencio et al. 2016). 
The production area of any company is related to problems such as work fatigue, monotony, pressure to meet 
production quotas, or work intensity (Alvarez and Noriega 2003). Additionally, according to Peña et al. (2015), 
operators in the production area are exposed to a higher accident rate. 
To address this problem, a methodology for the implementation of gamification techniques in training is proposed. 
Despite being a technique that is not currently widely used, gamification is becoming more relevant in international 
organizations, as it has qualities to provide an improvement in the face of organizational problems (Gallego and De 
Pablos 2013). 
Gamification consists of the implementation of mechanics or techniques based on the characteristics of a game, aimed 
at achieving greater use of the user's skills, the ability to absorb and retain knowledge, and improving productivity. 
With this, the staff can achieve objectives through recognition or incentives (Eslava Zomeño 2017). Gamification uses 
elements such as intrinsic or extrinsic motivation, based on theories of psychology such as the theory of operant 
conditioning (Wang et al. 2022). 
Successful cases of gamification have been applied in large companies such as Google or L'Oréal, and it has been 
verified that the proper application of this technique greatly increases the performance and interest of users, promotes 
a mentality improvement, and generates a work environment where continuous progress and competitiveness prevail 
(Joy 2017). Although there are not many organizations in Peru that apply gamification, some projects in the 
educational field have had good results (Jugando se Aprende 2018).

5. Conclusions  
In conclusion, the proposed methodology allowed for the most relevant studies to be analyzed with the VOSviewer 
bibliometric manager. The analysis of key terms and their occurrence through bibliometric visualization enabled initial 
conclusions to be made on the main topics being addressed by research, such as nursing and medical practitioners. 
Conversely, it also revealed a knowledge gap in the area of industrial safety and risk at work that could be explored 
in future empirical research. 
 
Moreover, this study highlights the main tools currently used in the implementation of security gamification, 
indicating that virtual tools such as computer software or the use of virtual reality instruments predominate. 
 
Finally, the synthesis of the context and results of the literature determined which topics are currently covered by 
gamification. The study showed that gamification offers a new teaching modality that is more interactive and 
entertaining, encouraging the improvement and development of job skills through games and rewards. However, it 
was also noted that gamification does not always produce a good result and further research is needed. Studies suggest 
that gamification is a more attractive learning method that guarantees at least the same results as traditional training, 
but it is necessary to identify the staff to be tested, determine the most motivating incentives for this population, and 
design a plot that is didactic and intuitive. 
 
Overall, this research can serve as a basis for future studies on the implementation of gamification, its benefits, and 
limitations in personnel training.

Abstract 
The ready-made garments (RMG) industry of Bangladesh is one of the renowned export-oriented garment industries 
in the world. Several hazardous fire incidents at RMG factories in recent decades became a matter of concern for 
national and international policymakers as well as stakeholders. Therefore, this study has been conducted to determine 
a prioritizing order of the fire risk factors of the RMG industry to assist decision-makers while implementing 
mitigation strategies. For this study, fire risk factors have been clustered into six criteria- causative factors, fire 
separation, egress obstruction, fire detection, fire protection, and egress lighting. Then the fire safety inspection reports 
of randomly selected 50 RMG factories have been analyzed with a Multi-Criteria Decision-making (MCDM) 
approach, the Criteria Importance Through Inter-Criteria Correlation (CRITIC) method, to determine the objective 
weights of the selected criteria. The number of risk factors observed in each criterion during fire safety inspections at 
the RMG factories has been considered as the numerical input for the CRITIC method. Prioritization has been obtained 
with the descending order of the computed weights for the risk criteria. This study finds that ‘egress obstruction’, 
‘causative factors’, and ‘fire separation’ are the most three weighted risk criteria by applying the CRITIC method. 
This prioritization will be helpful for decision-makers when the hierarchical implementation of mitigation actions is 
necessary due to various managerial constraints. The result of this study is expected to aid the managers of RMG 
factories to be more specific and accurate in case of deciding in a challenging situation.

1. Introduction
Bangladesh is one of the largest RMG manufacturing nations in the world exporting products to more than 150 
countries (BGMEA 2021), (Debnath et al. 2023). There are around 4500 factories, and over 4 million people are 
working in the RMG sector (Siraj et al. 2022a), (Fathi 2021). Ensuring a safe and sustainable workplace for such a 
huge industrial workforce is always a challenging issue for policymakers. In the last few decades, industrial fire-
related hazardous incidents in RMG factories are the deadliest barrier to overcome by the managers of this sector 
(Siraj et al. 2022b), (Hasan et al 2017). The fire in Tazreen Fashion in 2012, which caused more than 100 deaths and

Introduction
Since the end of the 19th century, the emerging energy source of hydrocarbons has had an important space, being 
applied in industries since the Second Industrial Revolution, specifically in the automotive industry, which led to its 
massive consumption in the application of the combustion engine of different vehicles, improving the quality of 
people's mobilization. The fundamental component for its operation was adapted to the consumption of fossil fuel, 
gasoline. As it became established, the automotive market evolved, achieving positive results in mass transportation. 
In 1971, the world began to show that the consumption of global energy fuels had a great impact on the use of 
hydrocarbons in many industries. The world showed significant dependence on the consumption of the main sources 
such as oil, natural gas, and coal. However, the overexploitation of fossil fuels has generated a lot of uncertainty over 
the years since the gas emissions that these fuels produce present gaps in the change of environmental temperatures 
in the various countries of the world. According to Pancorbo (2013), it is very probable that the earth's temperature 
will increase between 1.5 and 2°C by the year 2050. Many scientists and journalists have been taking the initiative to 
focus research on the reduction of gas emissions that generate climate change on the planet, which through the 
dissemination of knowledge manages to inform, raise awareness, and sensitize. In 2015, despite the constant concern

Proposed Improvements  
The proposal to investigate green hydrogen is subject to improving the quality of life and reducing the impact of 
environmental pollution in Peru, especially in the capital city of Lima. For this, in the present investigation, we analyze 
the good practices carried out by developed countries and the collection of scientific data that the researchers analyzed 
in the study of green hydrogen to achieve transfer to a friendly, technological ecosystem and easily adapt it to our 
social environments. The development of the idea was reflected in the experimentation stage, where, in the specialized 
laboratory, we used the tools and materials to develop the green hydrogen product, as previously observed.

6. Conclusion  
In the present investigation, we have been able to conclude that clean and green energy will promote a competitive 
strategy in the world for a cultural change that will allow environmental sustainability with the exploitation of 
renewable energy and its technological applications. In the experiments in the laboratory, we have been able to observe 
the chemical reactions that occur when the water in a saline state is combined with the entrance of electricity to form 
the electrolysis process, which produces hydrogen in a gaseous form. We later suggest that it go through a catalyst, 
which will separate the moles of hydrogen into electrons and protons for the formation of electricity and thus power 
electronic devices.

Abstract 
The oil spill occurred on January 15, 2022, on the Peruvian coast in the district of Ventanilla. REPSOL, the company 
responsible, said it harmed around 1000 species of fish, more than 1018 mollusks and crustaceans, and nearly 500 
species of marine algae, invertebrates, birds, and mammals, causing monetary losses in the fishing sector, both in 
small and medium-sized industries as well as large ones.  
The objective of this article is to analyze the impact of the oil spill on the biological diversity present on the affected 
beaches. The method that we will use is quantitative since it collects information, and since the results can be measured 
in numbers, the research design is non-experimental in the sense that the variables are not manipulated to have any 
effect. We will use the instrument of a pollster to collect the information of the people who live nearby.  
Finally, it is clear from the results that most of the population blames REPSOL and the Peruvian State for the oil spill. 
They believe that this ecological disaster will have very serious consequences for the environment, causing the 
extinction of some marine species.

Abstract 
The basic process in metal fabrication industry is welding which poses several risks and hazards to the workers. 
Welding process is the common method of metal joining and contributes to work related problems. The present 
study aims to identify the ergonomic risk factors and safety issues in welding units located in Karnataka State. 
Further it is proposed to investigate the awareness of workers to ergonomic risks, occupational safety and use of 
personnel protective gear (PPEs). The study comprises of about 60 workers from 10 different industries. The study 
is divided into three types of industries; general fabrication (06 units), furniture making (02 units) and heavy 
fabrication work like tractor trailers, pressure tanks (02 units). The welding methods include horizontal welding, 
vertical welding and overhead welding. Welding operators report high musculoskeletal complaints, back, neck and 
shoulder discomfort and pain in knees and ankles. The methodology includes observation and collection of 
demographic data, administering body part discomfort questionnaire, postural risk analysis by rapid upper limb 
assessment (RULA) and rapid entire body assessment (REBA), and measurement of environmental parameters like 
noise, illumination. Results indicate more than 70% workers reported discomfort in upper limbs and low back. Eye 
strain was the most common discomfort. Postural risk analysis by RULA shows 57% postures in high risk, mostly in 
overhead welding. REBA analysis shows 51% postures in high risk and 13% postures in very high risk, mostly in 
horizontal welding. It is found the use of safety devices and personnel protective gear is very low except the eye 
shield or goggles which reported 93% usage. Other safety devices like masks, gloves and apron have less than 12% 
usage. The use of ear plugs/muffs is about 16%. Apart from these observations, the workers often complain about 
general health like vision problems, accidents and injuries to body and job stress. The study has highlighted that the 
safety measures and awareness can be further strengthened and low-cost ergonomic interventions may be required to 
reduce the risks due to awkward postures.

Abstract 
Since Covid-19 had been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 12, 2020, 
various policies have been made by governments around the world, one of which is a lockdown. This policy interrupts 
companies from being able to manufacture and distribute their products causing supply chain disruptions. The 
healthcare industry is one of the supply chains that has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. There are severe 
shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies for Covid-19 treatment in hospitals 
around the world. One of the countries that experienced a disruption in the healthcare supply chain was Indonesia, due 
to its dependence on medical supplies from other countries, there was a ban on exports during the lockdown.  It is 
important to adopt Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) because of the dependencies in the supply chain. When SCR is 
adopted, a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is required as a tool to monitor and measure supply chain resilience 
performance. In this study, the indicators collected from the literature review, there are 9 indicators which are: security, 
knowledge management, visibility, risk management, collaboration, agility, flexibility, redundancy, market position, 
and 42 sub-indicators for supply chain resilience. Afterward, the indicators and sub-indicators were validated by 
several experts by filling out questionnaires. Using modified kappa (k*) for validation, eight healthcare experts 
validated 41 sub-indicators with a value of k* is more than 0.60.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is an infectious disease of the respiratory system caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The disease was first 
confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Due to the rapid spread and infection of most of the world's population, 
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 12 March 2020 (Ciotti et al. 2020). 
As a result, various policies were adopted, one of which was a lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19 (Rehman 
and Ali 2022). The lockdown was enforced by prohibiting residents from leaving their homes and closing public 
spaces such as recreation centers, restaurants, schools, and workplaces (Romdiati and Noveria 2022). This policy led 
to the closure of many suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors around the world (Rehman and Ali 2022). The closure 
of many of these companies caused supply chain disruptions in the industry (Agarwal et al. 2020). 
The healthcare industry is one of the supply chains that has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Hospitals 
around the world are experiencing severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies 
for Covid-19 treatment. Meanwhile, manufacturers of medical supplies are facing shortages of materials and 
components needed for production due to export bans, and many suppliers have shut down due to mobility restrictions 
that have limited their production capacity (Spieske et al. 2022).

The market position has four sub-indicators that are valid, namely: efficiency, financial performance, performance in 
fulfilling customer requirements, and interruption damages. Efficient is capable of producing output with minimum 
resources (A. Ali et al. 2017). In addition, organizations need to strengthen their financial position in order to recover 
from disruptions. The performance of meeting the requirements of customers refers to the measurements related to 
the performance of managing the satisfaction of customers, especially during periods of disruptions. In order to recover 
from disruptions, supply chains need to be aware of the impact of disruptions; this refers to the evaluation of the 
severity of the disruption which focuses on the calculation and measurement of losses due to the disruption (Han et 
al. 2020). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Studies on supply chain resilience have grown over the years, with stakeholders showing interest in the concept 
because of its impact on business continuity and competitiveness. Designing supply chain resilience to cope with long-
term disruptions, such as a pandemic, is essential because it can maintain demand fulfillment performance and costs. 
This research shows that the healthcare industry in Indonesia is still vulnerable to disruptions, this can be shown when 
there is a pandemic, the healthcare industry in Indonesia it is difficult to meet the demand for medical supplies such 
as PPE and medical devices (ventilators, tensimeters, and thermometers). Therefore, indicators are needed as 
performance measures to build a resilient supply chain. In this study, 9 indicators and 41 indicators were validated by 
healthcare industry experts using modified kappa, with the results shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. This research aims 
to enable stakeholders in their field to monitor and measure supply chain performance in developing supply chain 
resilience. 
 
Clearly, this study has some limitations. While this research only discusses SCR indicators collected from previous 
research and relevant to the healthcare industry in Indonesia, there is no research to determine the level of importance 
between indicators and the relationship between indicators. In addition, this study only focuses on medical supplies 
such as consumables and medical equipment, not pharmaceuticals. Future research should be aimed at determining 
the level of importance between indicators and the relationship between indicators, and this research should also focus 
on the pharmaceutical sector.

Abstract 
Technology dominates human activity in the industrial 5.0 era, where technological developments increase 
automation and digitalization as well as in the construction sector after pandemic. The increased speed of 
construction makes the life cycle of goods faster resulting in a continuous accumulation of waste, especially in the 
case of building construction. This study aims to examine the implementation of construction companies in tackling 
construction waste in Jakarta post the Covid-19 pandemic. This qualitative research uses a case study approach. 
Primary data was obtained through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Selection of respondents using 
the convenience sampling method, and data analysis using interactive modeling techniques. Construction companies 
in Jakarta have concrete actions to reduce construction waste. The company’s action strategy is to carry out the 
stages of the refurbishment, repair and recycling processes combined with elements of technology, policies, 
guidelines and regulations, in processing construction waste through appropriate procedures and innovate to create 
environmentally friendly products. In the sustainability action strategy, the company cooperates with the 
government and local communities in overcoming the problem of waste, minimizing its impact to achieve 
environmental sustainability in the construction sector. Therefore, the role of innovators in the field of construction 
waste management is needed, especially companies that are considered capable of solving these problems in order to 
realize the continuity of economic digitalization towards a better Indonesia so that green tech companies in 
Indonesia can become leading innovators in terms of processing construction waste management in the industrial 
revolution 5.0 era post pandemic.

1. Introduction
The world of construction cannot be separated from technology. The post-Covid-19 situation can be used as a 
momentum for the world of construction to change and find new models that are more effective, efficient, 
competitive and sustainable. Entering the industrial era 5.0 which relies on human resources in terms of creating a 
balance between economic progress and in solving social problems that occur in the midst of the community 
environment through a system that connects the virtual world with the real world, so that the industrial era 5.0 can 
be used as a momentum to realize the concept of development, especially in the infrastructure and construction 
climate in Indonesia. This is because infrastructure and construction are the most likely to combine human resources 
with technology 4.0. 
Utilization of information technology in the infrastructure sector such as digitizing toll road management, online 
attendance, the tender process for procurement of goods and services for infrastructure projects through E-
Procurement, and the use of drones for infrastructure development in hard-to-reach areas. 
Meanwhile, for construction work that involves many people, reengineering and redesigning of the project 
implementation scheme are carried out so that the project can be completed more quickly and efficiently.

the pre-construction and construction process phases, requiring collaboration in planning how to salvage materials 
and estimating the exact quantities needed to eliminate excess supply waste. 
Therefore, the construction waste management plan must contain clear messages to all members of the project team, 
including subcontractors. This is to avoid misunderstandings, so it is necessary to periodically conduct a project 
orientation to review the waste management plan with all parties at the work site, including where the bins are 
placed, how materials will be segregated or used. If the project uses a more detailed waste management plan, this 
ensures that everyone involved in the project knows the final destination of C&D waste. 
A significant reduction in construction waste begins with construction company stakeholders being actively 
involved in a sustainable and environmentally friendly construction process. Supported by an appropriate 
information technology system, it is possible to plan the flow of construction waste from upstream to downstream 
efficiently and effectively. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Industry 5.0 has encouraged people to act quickly, be more creative and more innovative in making policies. The 
digitization factor in the construction sector is a strategic step in facing the industrial era 5.0. For this reason, 
digitization must be carried out comprehensively, starting from developing human resources to building a supply 
chain system. Digitizing the development of the construction workforce must be carried out in a sustainable, 
consistent, and measurable manner from upstream to downstream. In the upstream sector, this digital development 
method will more quickly produce a competent workforce with a high value of knowledge, skills and attitudes. 
Whereas in the downstream sector, digitization will produce a productive workforce because it has high and 
controlled value standards. This strategy can be realized through work programs based on the application of digital 
technology such as remote workforce training and certification for all workforce categories which are carried out 
regularly and continuously. 
The concept of green construction is very possible to implement, at an affordable cost compared to many other 
things that can be saved. Through the application of green construction, it will be able to improve environmental 
aspects by saving other related aspects. 
Several strategies are recommended in the industrial era 5.0. post Covid-19, namely ease of regulation in facilitating 
construction waste processing procedures, government support in the development of a green construction industry, 
development of a high-tech recycling construction industry, as well as increased technological innovation in 
effective and efficient construction waste management, and it is necessary to develop an environmentally friendly 
green construction waste treatment approach to address this construction waste problem. 
In the context of construction waste management, Geographic Information System (GIS) has several suitable 
applications to increase the effectiveness of construction waste management. Geographic information systems are an 
important tool in planning the management of construction and demolition waste, as well as for facilitating the 
spatial analysis and control of embankments, sorting, collection, transport, and final destination of construction and 
demolition waste increase the recovery and recycling rate of materials (Paz, et. al., 2018). 
Engineers and construction companies must implement the use of sustainable and environmentally friendly 
construction materials. In addition, stakeholders should be routine in carrying out regular site inspections aimed at 
verifying all processes and actions in construction waste management have been carried out and are functioning 
properly. In addition, the recycling and transportation of construction waste must be monitored regularly at all times 
on a regular basis. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A well-organized construction organization will generate less waste. It is therefore very important to develop a 
detailed strategy regarding the area allocated for waste recycling, as well as its storage to increase productivity and 
efficiency for the company. Reusing and recycling materials on-site will reduce the cost of the final project. 
Companies must also be responsible for the environment, where construction waste management is one of the 
company's concrete actions to contribute solutions to future construction waste problems. The problem of waste 
management at construction sites will have an impact on reducing the amount of construction waste that is disposed 
of at the construction waste final disposal site. 
The sustainability of a comprehensive and economical construction well-planned waste management is a long-term 
investment for the construction industry. The basic principle used is ""Three R’s"" (namely Reduce, Reuse and 
Recycle) where these elements are combined with elements of technology, policies, guidelines, and regulations, so

that later they become the right strategic guidelines to strengthen sustainable principles in the right handling 
construction waste. 
In addition, waste management requirements should be planned at the pre-construction stage to ensure that 
compliant contractors and subcontractors are fully aware of the implications of these requirements on their work 
before and during construction. At the construction waste management planning stage, it must initially begin with 
the process of identifying project waste as an integral part of the overall material management stage process in a 
construction project. 
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in several construction works being delayed and behind schedule. 
However, with the policies and changes that have taken place, the construction sector is expected to become one of 
the drivers of Indonesia's post-pandemic economic growth, especially for construction companies in the Jakarta area. 
Therefore, it is important to develop an integrated strategy to treat construction waste from upstream to downstream 
as a whole to enable the achievement of sustainability goals. The world of construction needs to re-engineer 
construction management by adjusting and transforming itself in the industrial era 5.0 where technological support 
4.0 is absolutely necessary to complete work missions effectively, efficiently and on time and achieve sustainable 
optimal results.

1. Introduction
Non-communicable diseases have killed 41 million people every year or equivalent to 70% of deaths globally. One of 
the four main non-communicable diseases according to WHO is cardiovascular disease and stroke. Stroke ranks the 
second leading cause of death in the world and caused 6.2 million deaths in 2011 (Syafni 2020). 
Stroke basically still has the potential to recover after going through a stroke. However, patients who are able to 
survive post stroke have challenges in life. Stroke patient is likely to experience paralysis of half the body, difficulty 
to talk to other people (aphasia), slanted mouth (facial drop), weak arms and legs, impaired body coordination, mental 
changes, emotional disturbances, communication disorders, and loss of sense of taste. These residual symptoms can 
affect the physical, psychological and social aspects of the patient which will also have an impact on reducing 
productivity and quality of life both permanently and temporarily. Furthermore, physical effects can also appear such 
as partial paralysis, communication disorders and cognitive disorders. The most common deficit experienced by stroke 
patient that involves motor action. This physical paralysis can occur immediately and usually the patients notice that 
they cannot move their arms and legs on one side of the body (Pambudianto and Batan 2013). 
Moving the feet on the human body can also be a stimulus for other parts of the body. Activities that can be imitated 
such as walking or stepping, this movement can be modified by pedaling the legs. Physical activity for building 
strength can help the body's muscles work in holding something. Mini static bicycles can be moved easily when not 
in use, or in other words easy to store, they are simple and light in shape (Kesuma et al. 2019). 
The aim of this research is to develop a therapeutic aid for the rehabilitation process for post stroke patients, which is 
for foot therapy and developed with hand therapy tools.

Abstract 
Continuous Improvement systems are being promoted with more intensity in construction sector companies, but 
not with the expected result due to the high variability and breach of their operations. This project seeks to structure 
the chain of operations, generating key points of Quality Management using the Lean Six Sigma methodology, to 
reduce the variability and standardize the processes of the ADEICS company located in the San Miguel district, 
Lima, Peru. The DMAIC methodology was used for the development of this project. During the define phase, the 
process map was prepared as the strategic, operational and support processes were documented, having 16 
processes at the end. Likewise, a focus group was held to define this service's essential critical quality factors 
(CTQs). In the measuring phase, it was possible to establish the risk level of the processes (NPR) using the 
following tools: The process characterization matrix (SIPOC), The Analysis of Failure Modes and Effects 
(AMEF) and the relationships between areas with the Diagram Lines Notation (DLN). Finally, in the analysis 
phase, the processes to be improved were prioritized using as a base the inputs of the CTQ's table and the process 
map through the quality function deployment matrix (QFD), pending the implementation in the improvement 
phase of the three selected processes.

Introduction
Continuous improvement analysis focused on results in the construction-related sectors is very complex to 
maintain the repeatability of results due to the continuous manual procedures and the high variability they may 
entail (Czajkowska and Kadłubek 2015). Thus, the study conducted through benchmarking reinforces that 
companies in this sector that increase their competitiveness, quality, and productivity have developed a continuous 
improvement study based on process improvement and the PMBOK. By seeking to structure the interrelation 
between them, raise awareness among employees of the structure as mentioned earlier with the importance of 
defining it and measuring the efficiency of their processes (Hola 2015). Similarly, the benchmarking study aims 
to understand the mechanisms to improve and generate productivity metrics through a research process of the 
significant environmental factors, good practices that may impact the sector, and the strategic objectives that 
encourage their implementation (Zhang et al. 2017). 
In the civil sector, the dissemination of the ISO 9001-2015 Integrated Management System has been promoted 
through various entities, from a field of exploration of intervention by various stakeholders, factors of excellence, 
and quality criteria for creating value for customers that drive in the same direction as the company's strategic 
objectives to generate Multiple Management Systems [4]. 
Currently, ADEICS is an association that promotes projects involving expansion activities, consultancy, Civil 
Engineering, environmental monitoring, research, circular economy activities, and others, aiming to generate 
collaborative work among various entities. In recent periods, operations have focused on the project responsible

This result can also be verified and reflected in the BoxPlot in Figure 11, noting the significant difference between 
the means of the two samples.

Finally, we will be able to verify this improvement in increasing customer satisfaction and reducing the 
Communication CTQ gap in a forthcoming survey of the company's stakeholders.

Conclusions 
The general objective was achieved by developing the operations chain of ADEICS company through the Process 
Map, documentation, and improvement proposals, generating key points in Quality Management. 
The three types of processes were identified: operational, strategic, and support, through interviews, the PMBOK 
model, adapted to a project management company. Likewise, the stakeholders of ADEICS association were 
identified. 
The As-Is diagram of the identified processes was mapped and designed, using the SIPOC matrix, the DLN, and 
the FMEA. 
The processes to be improved were identified using the QFD Matrix, selecting the three processes to be improved: 
Execution, Ideation and Design, and Permission Management. 
Finally, improvement actions were proposed for the three selected processes, remaining their scheduling and 
prioritization with management. Likewise, we recommended including the Quality Management and Internal 
Review process to the current Process Map of the organization. 
We recommend implementing these improvement actions in the short term to measure the positive impact in the 
control phase of the satisfaction level expressed through the CTQs, achieving that all gaps are less than 5%. 
Lastly, we recommend that all companies and associations in the civil construction sector adopt these best 
practices of quality management in their organizations.

Abstract 
SERVQUAL is a scale used to determine the quality of telecommunication services. This scale aims to measure the 
difference between the service users by comparing their expectations from the service and their level of perception 
of the service they receive. With the widespread use of 4.5G, mobile operators have started to focus their 
infrastructure investments, tariffs, and advertisements on mobile data speeds and services (watching videos, playing 
online video games, instant messaging, etc.). The mobile services offered by the operators are affected by different 
factors such as the coverage power of the operator in that region, the time-dependent traffic of the customers, and 
the weather conditions. Therefore, differences can be observed between the mobile services offered by the operators 
to their customers and the quality of the services that the customers can access. In the study, it was aimed to measure 
4.5G service quality in Gaziantep with SERVQUAL method. This method is a data collection method that enables 
participants to reveal their satisfaction with using a product or service. The population of the research consists of 
individuals over the age of 18 who live in Gaziantep in 2023 and use a GSM operator. Interview questions were 
presented to approximately 600 people and 406 people out of 600 agreed to answer. The sample of the study 
consists of 406 participants randomly determined from the universe. SERVQUAL scale was used as data collection 
tool in the study. The scale consists of 22 items and 5 sub-dimensions. Quantitative data analysis methods were used 
in the analysis of the research data. In this context, the research data were analyzed with the SPSS24 data analysis 
program. In the analyzes, first of all, information on the demographic characteristics of the participants, percentage 
and frequency distributions were presented. Due to the normal distribution of the data, the parametric statistical 
techniques used in the analysis of which the independent sample t-test and ANOVA test.  As a result of the research, 
it was determined that the 4.5G satisfaction levels of the participants were lower than 3.5G. With 4.5G, it was 
determined that the satisfaction level with the file/video download speed was positive. According to the gender 
variable of the participants, the expected and actual service quality perceptions are showing similarity. The realized 
trust perceptions of the participants have income of 8500 TL or less are lower. It was determined that the 
participants who chose the operator due to Environmental Advice and Service Quality had a high perceived 
reliability perception of the operator, and a low perceived enthusiasm (willingness).

1. Introduction
In the globalizing world, technological developments and developments in the field of communication are examined 
in various disciplines. Although the developments have different outputs, people should be able to reach, benefit 
from and evaluate their experiences. In this context, while there are no great difficulties in determining and 
measuring indicators related to quality and performance in the field of production, the situation is different for the 
service industry, and measurements related to services may not be always easy. In a way, this is about measuring the 
benefit of the service. Therefore, it is important to make general evaluations about the perception of service in this 
regard. Improving or improving the quality of the service provided constitutes the first stage of service quality. An

Figure 3. Distribution of Participants by Satisfaction Rank with 4.5G Connectivity Compared to 3G Connection 
 
When the distribution of the participants according to the degree of satisfaction differences during the switch from 
3G connection to 4.5G connection, 3% of them were not satisfied at all, and 19.2% of them were very satisfied. 
Compared to the 3G connection, it can be said that a significant part of the participants is more satisfied with the 
4.5G connection.  
 
The findings obtained in the study were compared with various research findings in the literature. In a similar study, 
Beyaz (2013) conducted research to examine the service quality of GSM operators. In the study, there was no 
difference in service quality perceptions arising from the operator preference of the participants. It was stated that 
the service quality perceptions of the participants did not differ according to the age. Hotamışlı and Eleren (2012) 
examined the perceptions of GSM operators about service quality in their research. As a result of the analysis, 
although there was no difference between the expectations from the operators, there was a difference due to the 
realized/perceived features. In addition, it was observed that the participants could not fully obtain the service 
quality they expected in any dimension. While there is a difference in the perceptions of service quality due to the 
education level of the customers, there is no difference due to gender. In the research conducted by Gül and Yapraklı 
(2019) on the effect of service quality of GSM operators call centers on brand loyalty, it is seen that service quality 
is expressed as physical characteristics, reliability, assurance, empathy and responsiveness. Accordingly, it has been 
seen that service quality can be evaluated in five categories. In the study, it was seen that the participants had 
medium level perceptions due to responsiveness, empathy, brand loyalty, and above medium level due to 
compatibility. In addition, the effect of service quality on brand loyalty was examined, and in this context, it was 
concluded that reliability, enthusiasm and empathy were associated with brand loyalty. In the study conducted by 
Tayyar and Işık (2013) on the examination of the relationship between service quality and other variables in the 
GSM sector, it was stated that variables such as satisfaction with the services offered and service quality are 
important and that they affect the increase of customers' loyalty to businesses and ensuring continuity. In the study 
conducted by Aydınlı and Arslan (2016) on the effect of service quality dimensions on satisfaction in the business 
sector, it was determined that there is a relationship between satisfaction with the services offered and customer 
satisfaction and loyalty. Similarly, in the research conducted by Zanco and Kaya (2015) on the research of university 
students' reasons for choosing a GSM operator, it was stated that the operator preferences of the participants differed 
according to their gender, and the service quality, price, coverage area and close environment factors did not differ 
according to gender. On the other hand, women were more affected by advertisements than men. Similar to the 
research findings, Haque et al. (2010) stated that variables such as service quality, age, gender, advertisement and 
product quality are effective in their research on the factors affecting the GSM operator preferences of users. Similar 
to the findings, in the study conducted by Okeke (2014), it was concluded that variables such as advertisements, 
network quality, price and service quality are important in the operator preferences of the participants. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Within the scope of the research, an application was made in Gaziantep to measure the 4.5G service quality 
measurement of GSM operators with SERVQUAL analysis method. In the study, it was determined that the 
participants were generally satisfied with the operators and this situation did not differ according to gender. In

addition, it is concluded that the realized service quality in terms of concrete features, reliability, responsiveness, 
trust, empathy and service quality perception total scores is lower than the expected service quality perception 
levels. It has been determined that 4.5G satisfaction level of the participants are lower than the 3G connection.  
It was determined that the satisfaction of the participants was generally positive according to the service quality 
offered by the GSM operators, but there were also negative perceptions. Efforts can be made to improve these 
perceptions. In addition, it has been observed that the realized service quality is lower than the expected service 
quality. In this respect, it is important for businesses to try to provide services focused on customer expectations.

Abstract 
This paper presents a Six Sigma-based approach to optimize the supply chain network and mitigate the risk of chip 
supply shortage in the automotive industry based on survey data. Six Sigma is a data-driven approach to quality control 
that emphasizes the importance of minimizing defects and reducing variability in processes. The proposed approach 
integrates the Six Sigma methodology into the optimization and risk mitigation process of the supply chain network. 
The methodology consists of five phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC). This Study 
aims to suggest probable solutions for the chip shortage crisis. With deep statistical analysis, three root causes were 
identified a globalized semiconductor supply chain, an unoptimized supply chain network, and inventory management. 
In order to mitigate these problems, three probable solutions have been provided which are multisourcing, nearshoring, 
and increased lead time in the planning system.

Abstract 
This paper presents a Reliability and Maintainability approach to optimize the pitot tubes on any aircraft. For the pilot 
to be able to obtain precise numbers, the Pitot static system must be present and functioning properly. Without it, the 
pilot won't be able to make the right choice. Ice accumulation in flight poses a very serious risk to aviation safety. 
Failures and obstructions in the pitot-static system can have grave repercussions. Different reliability and 
maintainability methods will be used to improve the pitot tube's trustworthiness.

Abstract 
This study examines the impact of sociodemographic factors and aggression levels on anger levels among students in 
a university setting. In this modernized era, academic qualifications play an increasingly heavy role in determining a 
person’s eligibility in obtaining coveted white-collar occupations, an alarmingly high amount of discontent has been 
brewing among the tertiary level education students in Malaysia. This is backed up by the rapidly rising rate of protests 
among students voicing out their discontent and frustration on social media. Using a five-point Likert scale, a survey 
with a response rate of 94.76% was conducted on a total of 398 students at University of Cyberjaya by approaching 
them online and in person. Non-probability convenience sampling was the method chosen in this study, and it was 
done by approaching the most accessible students around the University of Cyberjaya. The study design executed is 
a cross-sectional study. Nonconsenting respondents in the questionnaire and nonresponse forms were excluded from 
this study. From the results of the survey, we were able to identify that the respondents have moderate levels of anger 
when placed in various situations and moderate levels of aggression. There is a significant relationship between gender 
and the level of anger. There is also a significant relationship between the level of anger and the level of aggression 
among the respondents. Hostility has the highest mean score on the Buss and Perry Aggression Scale. It is hoped that 
this study will be beneficial in tackling the identification of dysfunctional anger expression among students.

1. Introduction
According to Kazdin (2000), anger is defined as an emotion that is characterised by a feeling of rage and antagonism 
towards someone or situation that has deliberately done the person wrong. Anger can be triggered by certain 
experiences that a person has gone through. The response to these triggers can vary depending on the person’s state 
of mind and circumstance surrounding the situation. An emotional trigger is anything which can start an intense 
emotional reaction regardless of the person’s current mood. Examples of an emotional trigger include memories, 
experiences and events. 
Anger is one of the most common behaviour problems among youths nowadays. This is due to the fact that anger is 
believed to be a maladaptive coping behaviour to a stressful situation or environment which inhibits the person from 
adjusting healthily to the particular stressful situation (Cox Stabb and Bruckner 1999). However, anger is also a healthy 
emotion like all other emotions with the main difference between healthy anger and unhealthy anger being the way it 
is expressed by the person. For example, if anger is expressed assertively where the person expresses their anger 
without placing the blame on someone else, this is considered as healthy anger. While, if the anger is expressed 
aggressively where the person becomes forceful and loud, this is considered as unhealthy anger.  
When anger is not expressed properly but instead suppressed, it can lead to several underlying issues such as anxiety 
and depression (Dhasmana et al. 2018). Furthermore, this might have an adverse effect on the person’s relationship, 
behavioural and thinking patterns. This is a significant barrier to reasonable thinking in society, which has
