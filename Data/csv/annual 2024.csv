The Paradox of Budget Transparency in Reward-based 
Crowdfunding

Abstract 
We investigate how budget disclosure affects the funding outcome of reward-based crowdfunding campaigns. We 
show that information transparency can hurt campaign managers, reducing funding. To investigate the mechanism of 
such an unexpected finding, we investigated the details of the budgets, showing that the operational costs increase 
the funding while marketing costs reduce it. We also show that budget disclosure can increase the operational 
performance of campaign managers.

Component Procurement Under Unobservable Contracts 
Ehsan Bolandifar

Abstract 
This paper studies the optimal component procurement structures of two competing OEMs that rely on a joint 
contract manufacturer to produce two partially substitutable products. The contract manufacturer, in turn, needs 
to procure its components from a supplier. We investigate whether the OEMs should delegate component 
procurement to the contract manufacturer or control it when contracts are unobservable. When the supplier has 
pricing power, we show that under procurement control, all supply chain members might benefit from contract 
unobservability if the downstream market competition is moderate, while under delegation, all supply chain 
members benefit from contract unobservability unless the market competition is extremely fierce. We also 
demonstrate that component procurement control for both OEMs arises as the equilibrium, in contrast to the 
observable case. When the supply market is competitive, we show that both OEMs prefer to delegate their 
component procurement to the contract manufacturer to benefit from the discount aggregation. While 
procurement control might also emerge as an equilibrium, we show that it is Pareto dominated by the delegation 
strategy. We develop a new theory to explain different procurement strategies adopted by OEMs to procure 
different types of components, uncovering the informational role of different procurement structures under 
unobservable contracts as it shapes the equilibrium procurement structure.

Abstract 
This study investigates the impact of employing single-stage versus multi-stage mandrel cold-forming techniques to 
fabricate SS 304 U-shaped thin-walled metal bellows-type expansion joint profiles, with a specific focus on post-
forming thickness variations and profile precision. The aim is to discern the variations in thickness following the 
convolution profile formation in single-stage and multistage mandrel forming procedures. There are noteworthy 
distinctions between the profiles produced using these forming methods, providing valuable insights for 
manufacturers.

1. Introduction
Thin-walled metal bellows-type expansion joints, also referred to as metal bellows or expansion joints, play a vital 
role in piping systems by accommodating thermal expansion, vibration, and movement. They enable connections 
between fixed points, allowing axial, lateral, and angular movements in various applications like piping assemblies, 
vacuum systems, industrial plants, exhaust system assemblies, engines, turbine systems, aerospace applications, 
nuclear applications, heat exchangers, and pressure vessels (Gawande et al. 2015; Pagar and Patel 2021). A potential 
malfunction in these components could lead to catastrophic consequences, resulting in the breakdown of the entire 
system (Gawande et al. 2015).  
Expansion joints come in various profiles, each designed to address specific needs in different applications. The U-
shaped expansion joint profile is preferred for several reasons. The U-shape allows increased flexibility and axial 
movement, effectively accommodating a system’s thermal expansion, contraction, and other dynamic forces. This 
profile distributes stress and strain evenly along the bellows, reducing fatigue risk and enhancing overall durability 
(Mohammad et al. 2015). The U-shaped design also promotes smoother deflection and retraction, minimizing the 
potential for localized stress concentrations or points of failure. Mohammad et al. (2015) showed that U-shaped

Figure 7. Thickness variations at the various coordinates for metal bellows formed using single- and multi-stage 
forming 
 
In the fabrication of thin-walled structures, even a slight reduction in material thinning is crucial for ensuring the 
profile’s stability and capacity to withstand intended design conditions. Any improvement in minimizing thinning 
percentages significantly contributes to enhancing the structural integrity and performance of the profile under 
operational loads. Maintaining optimal material thickness throughout the forming process is essential to meet design 
specifications and ensure long-term durability. 
 
6. Conclusion  
When considering SS 304 U-shaped mandrel cold forming for metal expansion joint-type bellows, multi-stage forming 
has superior profile precision and a diminished percentage of variation in thickness. The findings from this study show 
that multi-stage forming consistently either matches or improves upon the thickness observed in single-stage forming. 
Notably, pronounced thinning, marked by a minimum thickness of 0.719 mm, is evident in single-stage forming at the 
convolution curve. In contrast, multi-stage forming exhibits a more moderated thinning, peaking at 9.6%, as opposed 
to the 11.25% observed in single-stage processes. This observed profile consistency in multistage forming further 
emphasizes its aesthetic and functional advantages.

Abstract 
This paper investigates the development of asbestos-free brake pads utilizing carbon nanotubes derived from waste 
rice husks. The aim was to replace the hazardous asbestos with an eco-friendly composite. The study implemented 
an experimental research design approach. The sol-gel method was used in the production of carbon nanotubes 
(CNTS) from rice husks. The composition of the brake pads was developed by varying the CNTs (0.5–1.5 wt. %). 
About five (5) weight percent CaCO3 obtained from oyster shells served as a filler. In addition, five-(5) weight 
percent graphite served as a friction material, which was added to the mixture of epoxy and hardener. Wear, 
thickness swelling in SEA oil and water, hardness values, and microstructure are among the properties that were 
examined. The results show that the brake pad from the CNTs formulation at 1.5 wt. percentage was not only 
effective but also comparable to conventional brake pads in performance. Therefore, the research proposes the use 
of CNT grade derived from rice husks as a convenient alternative material for the production of asbestos-free brake 
pads.

4. Conclusions 
This research looked at how asbestos brake pads can be replaced using novel friction materials made of carbon 
nanotubes from rice husk, CaCO3 from oyster shell, and graphite from old batteries. The brake pads were made 
using the solution-stir-cast method. The optimal conditions were achieved at 1.5 wt% carbon nanotubes 
manufactured from rice husk. These conditions comprised a wear rate of 2.15 mg/m and a coefficient of friction of 
0.42. The values obtained are within the acceptable range for brakes with high friction. As a result of the strong 
interfacial bonding between the particles and the binder, higher frictional brake pads were attained in this research. 
The use of these innovative materials will eliminate the primary issue with brake pads made of asbestos.

Abstract 
This research set out to examine a variety of variables for a full determination of the effects of all factors pertaining 
to deposition techniques and interactions between nanoparticles and substrates on the hydrophobicity and wettability 
of surface materials. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic effects on the super-hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties 
of Calcium Oxide nanoparticles (CaOnp) were examined. The deposition was done on glass and silicone rubber 
(PDMS) substrates. The microstructure, contact angle hysteresis (CAH), and static contact angle (SCA) were all 
used to evaluate the characteristics. The results demonstrate that the hydrophobic CaO nanoparticles and PDMS 
substrate interact synergistically to produce more advantageous hierarchical topologies with lower surface energy. 
The results show that PDMS in combination with hydrophobic CaO nanoparticles as well as horizontal and vertical 
drying procedures both satisfy the two requirements for a self-cleaning surface and super-hydrophobic surface.

process and drying technique; in contrast to the control sample, the HP-containing samples that were dried vertically 
showed a little increase, but those that were dried horizontally showed a decrease. Improvement in SCA of the 
vertical dried samples was attributed to the creation of a more uniform, rougher surface that aids in the dispersion of 
the nanoparticles to cover the entire surface, resulting in high air cavities, and hence the regime of Cassie-Baxter 
wetting behavior of hydrophobic surfaces. The increase in SCA with HB samples was due to the enhanced 
compatibility of the PDMS substrate with the covering oligomers of the nanoparticles. The dynamic contact angle 
(CAH) of each surface was calculated using the receding and advancing contact angles, for super-hydrophobic 
surfaces without the capacity to self-clean (CAH > 5°), in order to evaluate each surface's ability to clean itself. 
When a surface has self-cleaning characteristics, the CAH is less than 5°, which macroscopically demonstrates that 
there is no pinning to the surface and the droplet baseline disappears as soon as liquid withdrawal begins. The 
contact angle of dynamic (CAH) findings for the samples under investigation is shown in Figure 5. In contrast, the 
addition of HP to the glass substrates prevented the materials from acting as self-cleaning surfaces. This was 
ascribed to surface air pockets packed with water that had held the droplets to the surface. This was caused by the 
hydrophilic nanoparticles' (HP) high wettability, or the strong adhesion between the solid and aqueous surfaces 
(Ebert and Bhushan, 2012).

However, after spraying PDMS with HB, the decrease abruptly started to recede, and the CAH was found to be less 
than 5° (Figure 5). This is because the droplet of the surface was pinned in the samples of sprayed HP on PDMS that 
had been dried both horizontally and vertically. Similar to how a droplet of water on a leaf lotus only faintly adhered 
to the surface, the surface is capable of self-cleaning. This behavior is shown by the water droplet in a Cassie-Baxter 
setting (Ebert and Bhushan, 2012). The only PDMS surfaces that met the two requirements for a self-cleaning 
surface and super-hydrophobic surface were those made using the spray deposition method in conjunction with 
hydrophobic CaO nanoparticles and both horizontal and vertical drying techniques (Ebert and Bhushan, 2012). 
4. Conclusion
In order to define the adaptive production parameters for generating self-cleaning and very hydrophobic surfaces for 
sheathing electrical insulators, the effects of CaO nanoparticle generated from oyster shell were explored in this 
study for the first time. The following conclusion may be drawn from the work: In general, the hydrophobic CaO 
nanoparticles and the PDMS substrate collaborated to develop more advantageous hierarchical topologies with 
lower surface energy. The PDMS substrates led to the highest super-hydrophobicity (SCA > 150°). It was therefore 
shown that the materials' ability to self-clean and exhibit superhydrophobicity was significantly influenced by 
surface chemistry, drying and CaOnp types. The innovative coating's super-hydrophobic and self-cleaning qualities 
should be investigated for long-term stability or durability.

Abstract 
The proposed conference paper addresses a systemic approach for risk-based third-party inspections of fire alarm 
systems. In the first part of the article, there is a comprehensive literature review of what the status is regarding current 
research on the use of risk-based inspection methodology on fire alarm systems. This is followed by an explanation 
of the chosen methodology. The paper then evaluates and presents the results of expert interviews with manufacturers 
of fire alarm systems as well as the results of surveys among recognized experts for the inspection of fire alarm systems 
in Germany. The evaluation is carried out by means of a qualitative content analysis. Using the results from these 
surveys as well as the findings on defect occurrence-statistics from previous work by the authors, a systemic approach 
for the risk-based test content to be selected for third-party inspections of the systems by technical experts is then 
presented. The results serve as a basis for an optimized inspection concept to increase efficiency in the operation of 
the systems while maintaining or improving availability. Furthermore, suggestions are made as to which inspection 
contents must be included or given increased attention due to technical innovations as well as a changed risk situation. 
The last part of the conference contribution is a discussion of the results and a summary of the most important findings.

1. Introduction
Fire alarm systems play an essential role in ensuring the safety of people and animals in complex or publicly used 
buildings (Merschbacher, 2018). In terms of building code requirements, these systems fulfill the tasks of detecting 
fires in the formation phase, localizing the dangerous event, alerting emergency services (e.g., fire department, police, 
rescue service), warning people in the danger zone, and controlling other fire protection-relevant parts of the technical 
building equipment.

4.5 Discussion 
1. The analyses presented, which form the basis of the specific risk factors and risk priority factors identified, 
show that a risk-oriented differentiation of the inspection content within the scope of third-party inspections 
is possible in principle and that it is therefore also possible to differentiate the inspection depth to be selected 
and the scope of the inspections. This forms a basis for a risk-based inspection approach. 
 
2. The proposed systemic approach meets the fundamentals of risk-based inspection, which is since risks can 
be narrowed down to certain sub-areas of systems according to their priority, and thus areas of systems where 
there is an increased risk can be looked at with increased depth and effort. This additional effort can be saved 
when inspecting less risky system components. This approach can increase the overall efficiency and 
effectiveness of inspections and conserve resources and manpower. 
 
3. The approach shown represents an open framework within which guidelines technical experts can vary the 
inspection content in the context of third-party inspections. The qualitative classification leaves room for 
discretion, which allows individual adjustments to be made based on the experience of the experts, but which 
correspond to a systemic framework. 
 
4. Within the framework of the approach shown, the operating conditions or the operator behavior of the system 
are also considered through the influence on the cycle or the determination of the intervals of the recurring 
tests. This is an important aspect, which was mentioned by all the experts interviewed as a decisive 
influencing factor on the risk of system failures and defects. 
 
 
5. Proposed Improvements 
The studies presented in this article have shown that it is possible to successfully and systemically implement a risk-
oriented inspection approach based on statistical studies of the frequency of occurrence of defects, the potential extent 
of damage, and the probability of detection.  
 
The approach currently chosen only takes into account risk factors internal to the system, i.e. risks emanating from 
the fire alarm system. In addition to these influencing factors, it is also relevant from the authors' point of view to 
consider the influence of a fire alarm system in the construct of the overall fire protection measures of a building. For 
example, it is important to consider whether a system is used in a ground-floor kindergarten or a multi-story assembly 
center, or even in an infrastructure facility such as an airport or train station. This represents additional ""external risk 
factors"" whose influence on the choice of testing depth or a comprehensive risk-based deployment must be considered. 
This will be further investigated in future research activities. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, we demonstrated a systemic approach for risk-based determination of the depth of inspection of third-
party inspections of fire alarm systems. The approach presented is based on the prioritization of inspection contents 
or the inspection depth / number of samples of the individual inspection contents based on risk factors. As a basis for 
the work, the contents of the current tests were analyzed in accordance with the chosen methodology and, based on 
the assessment of technical experts, expanded to include additional test contents that have arisen, for example, due to 
technical innovations. The risk priority factors used to create a risk-oriented approach are based on the product of the 
probability of occurrence, the potential extent of damage and the probability of detection of defects in the course of 
plant operation. These factors were determined qualitatively and are presented in the article. The approach shown 
provides experts who perform third-party inspections of fire alarm systems with a guideline for the first time on how 
to systematically adjust the inspection depth on the basis of an individual risk assessment. This enables a more efficient 
execution of the inspection, which is optimized with regard to the effectiveness of the inspections. 
 
In the context of planned future work, a deepening of the approach is planned. Especially with regard to further 
external risk factors, which are based on the individual protection goal of the fire alarm system as well as the building 
structures.

Abstract 
Unbalanced bidding is a widely used practice in competitive bidding and is often associated with unit price contracts. 
This practice has attracted the attention of researchers for more than seventy years due to its impacts on the owner and 
the contractor. This paper presents the results of a survey targeting construction contractors in Jordan to ascertain the 
root causes of this practice, common forms of unbalanced bidding, owner’s prevention strategies to mitigate this 
practice, and detection methods for unbalanced bidding. The study indicated that discrepancies in the owner-provided 
quantities of work and the utilization of unit pricing for items that are difficult to estimate their quantities accurately 
are the most enabling circumstances for unbalanced bidding. The study also revealed that the most common types of 
unbalancing bids in the Jordanian construction industry are front-end loading and increasing the unit prices of items 
that have underestimated quantities while simultaneously decreasing the prices of items that have overestimated 
quantities. The survey respondents indicated that the top-ranking strategies that owners can utilize to reduce the extent 
of this practice are ensuring accurate estimating of quantities in the bill of quantities, and timely processing of progress 
payments. The findings of this study are beneficial to both owners and contractors. Owners will be better aware of the 
current utilization of unbalanced bidding by contractors and can improve bidding rules and instructions to mitigate 
this practice. Contractors will also have a better understanding of their competitors' utilization of the imbalance in 
their submitted bids.

1. Introduction
Unbalanced bidding refers to the process of modifying the item rates of a bid while keeping the total bid price 
unchanged, and involves increasing the price of an item or a number of items while simultaneously reducing the price 
of an item or a number of items. The standard specifications for roads and structures of the North Carolina Department 
of Transportation (NCDOT 2012) define an unbalanced bid as “a bid that includes any unbalanced bid price.” The 
same standard (NCDOT 2012) defines an unbalanced bid price as “a unit or lump sum bid price that does not reflect 
reasonable actual costs that the bidder anticipates for the performance of the item in question along with a reasonable 
proportionate share of the bidder's anticipated profit, overhead costs, and other indirect costs.” This practice has 
several forms, such as front-end loading, quantity error exploitation, back-end loading, and others. In front-end 
loading, the contractor increases the rates of the items that will be performed during the early stages of the project and 
decreases the rates of the items that will be performed at the end of the project. This form is utilized mainly to reduce 
the financing costs of the project and offset mobilization costs. On the other hand, quantity error exploitation is based

The second-ranked prevention strategy, with a mean score of 4.05, was processing certified payments to the contractor 
without delay. This reflects the importance of providing timely progress payments to the contractor as a mitigation 
measure against front-end loading. The third-ranked prevention strategy, with a mean score of 3.86, was preparing an 
accurate owner cost estimate for each line item before releasing the invitation for bids, and then disqualifying bids 
that significantly deviate from the owner's cost estimate. This stressed the importance of having a reliable owner’s 
estimate for the work items to facilitate bid evaluation and guide the negotiations around valuing variation orders 
during construction. The lowest-ranked strategy has a mean score of 3.14 (i.e., a ranking above 3) and was establishing 
a process for accepting complaints from competing bidders who have credible proof that the unit prices given by the 
lowest bidder are unbalanced, as well as disclosing the unit rates submitted by all bidders for project line items. The 
respondents’ evaluation suggests that all listed prevention strategies are valid and worth adoption by owners to reduce 
motivation and the opportunity for unbalanced bidding. The grand mean also indicates that there were positive 
attitudes toward all the statements included in this section. 
 
3.4 Identifying unbalanced bids 
Identifying unbalanced bids during the bid evaluation stage is a challenging task because owners do not have the cost 
data of bidders and because the submitted rates of bidders include indirect costs and an intended profit margin as well 
as the bidder’s perception of risks involved in the performance of work. Several studies have highlighted this difficulty 
in identifying unbalanced bids (Hyari et al. 2016; Skitmore and Cattell 2013). The common practice used by owners 
to identify unbalanced bid offers is to compare the item rates submitted by construction bidders with the engineer’s 
estimate prepared before advertising the project for bidding (Alhyari and Hyari 2022; WisDOT 2022; NJDOT 2019). 
We also asked the respondents about the possible baseline measure that can help owners in detecting unbalanced 
bidding. Figure 3 illustrates that, the top-ranked baseline for identifying unbalanced bidding is comparing the rates 
provided by the lowest bidder with the average rates submitted by the next three lowest bidders. Two-thirds of the 
respondents have selected this baseline as the best measure to identify unbalanced bids. It is noteworthy that only 20% 
of the respondents selected the use of the engineer’s estimate as a baseline for comparison, which indicates that the 
common practice utilized by owners to spot unbalanced bids is not convincing to contractors. Owners may utilize the 
method selected by the majority of the survey respondents and evaluate the performance of this method.

4. Conclusion 
Unbalanced bidding is a common tactic adopted by contractors bidding competitively for unit price contracts. This 
practice is controversial because it is promoted in a large number of research publications, although it is an undesirable 
practice in many public bidding regulations and may lead to the rejection of the sub-mitted bid as a nonresponsive 
one. This paper presented the results of a survey that targeted construction contractors in Jordan to obtain their 
perspective on unbalanced bidding. The respondents ranked errors in the quantities of work provided by the owner in 
the bidding documents as the most important factor that enables bid unbalancing. The two most commonly used types 
of unbalanced pricing are front-end loading and quantity error exploitation. According to the survey's respondents, the

most suitable approach for owners to detect unbalanced bidding would be to compare the item prices submitted by the 
lowest-bidder con-tractor to the average of the prices submitted by the next three lowest-bidder contractors. The results 
indicated that ensuring accurate quantities of work and eliminating delayed payments were the top ranked prevention 
factors that could reduce the extent of unbalanced bidding. 
 
The outcomes of the survey are useful as they provide insight on the perceptions of the contractors themselves 
regarding this controversial practice. Bidding regulations should establish clear rules regarding their policy on 
unbalanced bidding in order to provide competing bidders with an equal opportunity to win the contract. Further 
research is needed to develop guidelines that draw a line between acceptable levels of unbalanced bidding and 
unacceptable ones.

Abstract 
With the growth of the manufacturing industry, any unexpected failure of industrial equipment or machine breakdown 
can result in severe financial loss for the business. This is why it is critical to have a strategy for early detection and 
prediction for the failures. Predictive Maintenance encompasses all operational techniques and actions necessary to 
maintain machine availability and prevent downtime. The purpose of this article is to implement the machine-learning 
algorithm to develop a predictive maintenance and condition-based maintenance (CBM) systems. A real-world 
application of existing machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance was proposed and implemented using 
an artificial neural network (ANN). The results indicated that all predicted failures were correctly classified, with an

Abstract 
The maintainability analyses of a repairable mobile earth-moving equipment was undertaken. Using the analytical 
research approach, the Reliability, Availability and Maintainability models of the system were established through 
tedious computations to reveal the most pertinent candidate theoretical distributions that best modelled each quantity. 
Data was taken from a typical example of a Wheel loader Engine used in Crushed Rock Industries (NIG) Limited, 
located in Ebonyi State Nigeria. The results show that the equipment can retain up to 0.9 Reliability after 12o hours 
of operation. The results also show that the Engine system can be available for over 98% when operated under the 
stipulated design conditions, while about 17.38hours is the mean period required for the engine to be restored to its 
normal operating condition after a particular failure, when maintenance is carried out according to the designers 
prescription. The work further shows that mathematical modeling can be a good means of establishing actionable 
maintenance policies.

1. Introduction
Reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) are crucial system characteristics that determine product utility 
and life cycle cost. According to (Baboria & Devi, 2022)), they originated during World War II, when Germans built 
chained armor machines that could operate in any environment. RAM analysis has been developed to minimize 
operational costs and increase system reliability. Reliability refers to the capacity of an equipment to execute its

5.2  Reliability assessment 
For the engine system, the failure process was found to be an exponential distribution with shape parameter 𝜆𝜆=
0.000793. Equation (20) presents the reliability model for the Wheel loader engine system after a given operational 
time. 
𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑒𝑒−0.000793𝑡𝑡  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(20) 
 
With model (20), it will be possible to obtain the reliability level of the system at any given period, while the 
maintenance Engineer is expected to integrate other maintenance resources in deciding the exact level of operational 
Reliability for the Engine system. For example, assuming an operational time of 120 hours (5 days) of operation, 
model (20) can be applied to ascertain the Reliability level of the Engine System, which is 0.90923. 
 
5.3. Maintainability assessment 
The engine system repair time model follows from the analysis defining the log-normal distribution as the candidate 
for further analysis. Equation (11) presents the general cumulative distribution function H(t). From equation (11) 
𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑠𝑠 are distribution parameters found to be 5.002 and 1.5782 respectively, and Φ is the standardized normal 
variate. Hence, the repair function was established as shown in equation (21).

Employing equation (11), the MTTR was obtained to be 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀= 17.38ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟.  
 
5.4.  Availability assessment 
Analytical modeling of wheel loaders primarily relies on failure and repair data, making inherent availability the most 
suitable fit for determining system availability. Engine system availability can be calculated as 
𝑨𝑨𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊(𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬) =

The inherent availability of the wheel loader Engine gave 𝑨𝑨𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊(𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬𝑬) = 𝟎𝟎. 𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗𝟗 
Thus; wheel loader engine can be available for over 98% of its operating time when operated under the stipulated 
conditions and under the normal design environment.  
 
6.  Conclusion 
This research work has fulfilled its cleavage to presenting a logical evaluation of data required to improve wheel 
loader maintenance in Nigeria, especially in quarry or construction industries, by evaluating the RAM quantities. The 
study used two years of failure and repair data from the crushed rock industries (NIG) to perform analytical and RAM 
analysis. The project improved knowledge of RAM behavior in heavy-duty machinery, established a RAM analysis 
model, and created a framework for monitoring heavy-duty equipment performance.

Abstract 
Dealing with production planning and scheduling in modern production networks becomes more and more complex. 
Globalization and mass customization are two megatrends influencing this trend especially in automotive suppliers’ 
industry due to the high internationality of plants and factory of an industrial company as well as the heterogeneous 
product portfolio. However, there are some tools, methods and principles which can counteract this trends and help 
making production planning more agile digital. During this paper, a digital and automated Kanban solution will be 
implemented at a certain process in an automotive supplier’s plant. To make the effects visible, the current process 
and its weaknesses are visualized in a value stream map of the current situation with conventional Kanban planning 
during the Analysis phase. Thus, the future, optimized value stream with the use of a digital and automated Kanban 
solution is designed and mentioned in the results.  In summary, the introduction of this Kanban solution can lower the 
costs of the planning process. In the example used in this paper, the total costs for this quantity of Kanban can be 
decreased by over 50%. Further, other weaknesses of this process could be erased as well. Those results are 
differentiated in a practical and a monetary comparison.

6. Conclusion 
In addition to the recording of material and information flows, a data analysis of the key figures of the Kanban system 
was also carried out. Through the methodology of value stream design, it was possible to identify weaknesses and 
framework conditions. Based on these requirements for the target concept could be derived. The first step was to 
optimize the of the Kanban system within the framework of the value stream design. Automated Kanban calculation 
was considered as a solution. For this purpose, the prerequisites for implementation and application were created. 
These consisted of the re-dimensioning of the areas, the parameterization of calculation profiles and control loops. 
This enabled the system to perform the calculation system, so that the results obtained could then be compared with a 
with a common formula in the literature. Despite a discrepancy of both results of approximately 10 %, caused by the 
distorted system situation, a practical and monetary comparison showed the potential of the Automatic Kanban 
Calculation. If the target concept created is compared with the principles of Lean Management, the following is 
achieved through the automatic Kanban calculation and the omission of Excel planning the principle of integration is 
made possible. Further, the principles of flow, clock and pull are supported and improved by the Kanban system. 
Thus, the complete design of an electronic Kanban system can be realized. Physical cards and manual Kanban cards 
can thus become obsolete. This outlook corresponds to the endless principle of perfection and the necessary striving 
for continuous improvement.

Abstract 
This study presents an integrated solution to the challenges in the global clothing industry, prioritizing worker well-
being and environmental sustainability. Through an ergonomic framework, it aims to achieve sustainability and cost-
effectiveness. The research employs established tools like RULA and REBA and diverse methods, including 
observations, interviews, and questionnaires, to quantitatively and qualitatively assess ergonomic risks. The study 
guides the clothing sector towards a more ethical, sustainable, and efficient production paradigm, bridging the gap 
between ergonomics, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. The results show that a conscientious transformation that 
emphasizes economic growth and workers' welfare is still lacking. Hence, result-oriented measures that can improve 
the profitability and environmental responsibility of stake holders and workers in the clothing industry were 
recommended.

manipulation was associated with increased physical discomfort, especially in the neck, upper and middle back, right 
shoulder, and hands. Training methods varied, with room for improvement in ongoing training and performance 
feedback, particularly for younger workers. These findings emphasize the need for ergonomic interventions in the 
clothing industry to enhance worker well-being and reduce discomfort and injury. 
5.1.2.  Ergonomic practices and awareness 
This study tried to establish the extent of knowledge of ergonomic practices and awareness among the clothing 
industries in the study stretch. Figure 2 captures what was obtained in the places visited (Figure 2)

Figure 2: A and B: Ergonomic practices, awareness, applicability and challenges of ergonomics in the studied 
workplaces 
Training in ergonomic practices is essential for workers' safety and health, with 68% having received training. 
Integrating ergonomic criteria into workstation design and tools is crucial for promoting user comfort and reducing 
awkward postures, as 58% of employees apply ergonomic principles. Creating awareness about available ergonomic 
resources, known by 64%, empowers workers to report discomfort and access assistance. The clothing industry faces 
ergonomic challenges, with 62% of workers encountering them stemming from repetitive tasks, prolonged standing, 
and awkward postures. Familiarity with ergonomic concepts, reported by 72%, is vital for recognizing and addressing 
potential issues in the garment production process. 
5.2. 
Proposed improvement 
Proposed improvements for the ergonomic framework enhancement in the clothing industry include adjustable 
workstation, ergonomic tools, focused and enhanced employees training, optimized workspace layouts, comfortable 
seating, regular break and a feedback loop. These measures can reduce strain, prevent injuries, and foster a healthier 
and more productive work environment. 
 
5.3.Validation 
To validate the proposed project of creating an ergonomic framework for the clothing industry's sustainability and 
cost-effectiveness, a comprehensive plan was outlined. This includes ergonomic interventions, worker feedback 
integration, performance monitoring, comparative analysis, and expert review, all aimed at validating the framework's 
practicality and alignment with industry standards. These steps were essential to ensuring the project's success and 
industry-wide applicability. As this study marks the initial exploration within this particular industry and location, 
further inquiry is necessary to validate these findings. Nonetheless, it’s evident that the workstation exhibits 
inadequate design, prompting an immediate need for broader -scale interventions.   
 
6. Conclusion 
This project successfully developed an ergonomic framework that balances sustainability and cost-effectiveness in the 
clothing industry in Nigeria. By employing diverse methodologies, including quantitative tools (RULA and REBA) 
83","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

and qualitative approaches (observation, interviews, and surveys), it identified ergonomic risks and contextual 
intricacies in clothing production. The resulting framework prioritizes high-risk task interventions, improving 
workspace design and training programs, and embracing reduced-waste principles to optimize processes. Stakeholder 
commitment and ongoing adherence are vital for successful implementation in this evolving industry. This study 
underscores ergonomics' role in enhancing worker well-being, reducing absenteeism, and boosting productivity. It 
highlights the need for a trans-formative organizational culture shift and continual ergonomic attention, making it a 
potent catalyst for industry transformation.

Abstract 
The plastics industry has grown in recent years due to growing demand in sectors such as construction and 
transportation, contributing 4% of the industrial GDP and employing more than 200,000 workers in the country. 
However, it has been identified that companies in the sector operate with low availability (70.83%) due to various 
production problems, including hours lost due to lack of machine maintenance. On the other hand, because of these 
problems, demand exceeds supply due to the low availability of the companies in the plastics sector. The literature 
review suggests that Lean Manufacturing (SMED, Standardization of Work, 5S) and the TPM (Total Productive 
Maintenance) technique are necessary tools to solve these problems. Finally, the implementation of these tools will 
allow solving the mentioned problems by increasing availability by 90%.

1. Introduction
The Manufacturing Sector is important for the Peruvian economy, with a contribution of 17% to PBI and employing 
8.9% of the employed PEA. Raw materials for manufacturing production can come from various industries. The sector 
is divided into Primary and non-Primary Manufacturing, with the latter made up of Consumer Goods, Intermediate 
Goods, Capital Goods and Industrial Services. The manufacturing of plastic products is 18% of non-primary 
manufacturing production (INEI, 2022). The production process has different activities that can have problems, such 
as accidents or deficiencies in machinery, which can negatively affect production. In addition, it is mentioned that 
demand is greater than supply due to low production in the plastic sector, which is partly due to the lack of maintenance 
of the machines (Ames, V. et al., 2019). On the other hand, there is research that has identified problems in other 
countries, such as lack of stock during tool change in a company in India (Ahmad et al., 2018), Another case study 
from Portugal is presented that shows a diagnosis of the company regarding machine failures and how they affect 
production processes, in this way it seeks to optimize processes and increase availability through the measurement of 
indicators. MTTR, MTBF and OEE (Pinto et al., 2020), a study carried out in the United States says that the problem

6. Conclusions 
After carrying out this investigation, it can be concluded that the implementation of Lean Manufacturing techniques 
can lead to an increase in efficiency in a certain area of a company in the manufacturing sector. The findings reveal 
that all the parameters suggested to evaluate the current situation of the company have undergone significant 
improvements. Through the use of the Problem Tree, Pareto Diagram and Value Stream Mapping (VSM), it was 
possible to show that indicators such as the percentage of machinery stoppages (74.26%) and power outages (26.74%) 
were the two main causes of the low availability of machinery (70.83%) which negatively influences the Total 
Efficiency of the Equipment (55.88%). After analysing the main root causes, it is concluded that the injection area is 
the one that presents the greatest problems in the plant that impairs the production of caps. This is because the main 
unproductive hours of machinery are affected by the lack of maintenance of the same. Therefore, with the improvement 
proposal using the 5s and TPM methodology in the simulation, a better result of efficiency and availability of the 
machinery was obtained by 64.94% and 78.64% respectively, By properly applying the principles of 5S and 
standardized work in the area of injection and tools, it was possible to reduce tool search times by 80% while the 
percentage of tools and equipment classified and organized increased to 85.94%. The accuracy of the simulation model 
was confirmed by testing it under three different scenarios over different time periods. The results obtained in each 
scenario were favourable, indicating that the project is viable and suitable for implementation in the business 
environment.

Abstract 
Textile SMEs currently have a high demand for orders; however, there is a trend of increasing customer dissatisfaction, 
which is mainly related to shortages, low product quality and failure to meet deadlines. Therefore, a model was 
developed using the Lean Manufacturing methodology and analysis tools, including 5S. The case study is about a 
garment manufacturer and merchant SME in Peru, which developed a model to improve the low level of service they 
provide to their customers. The investigation shows the improvement of the level of service from 70% to 93%, likewise 
in the economic aspect a saving of 25,363.53 soles is shown, which represents 77%. This model proposal was 
implemented through the pilot test and simulation through the Arena V16 software, it also shows that the application 
of the Lean methodology together with analysis tools provide an improvement in processes such as warehouse 
management and quality. This study can serve as a guide to lay the foundation for business improvement for SMEs 
facing similar quality and logistics issues that is needed to improve service level growth.

1. Introduction
In Peru, the manufacturing sector and in particular that of the textile and clothing industry is very important as it is a 
of the industrial activities that contribute the most to development from the country. The Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) of this sector represented 14% of the total in the years from 2017 to 2021 occupying the second place with the 
highest contribution (Banco Central de Reserva del Perú 2022). The textile and clothing industry represents 30.6%, 
thus becoming the activity with the greatest participation (Sociedad Nacional de Industrias 2019) and according to the 
Foreign Trade Society of Peru the micro and small companies represent 95% of the sector (Sociedad de Comercio 
Exterior del Perú 2020).

6. Conclusion 
After this investigation, we can conclude that the application of the Lean Manufacturing method can increase 
productivity in a production area in the textile industry. The results show that all the indicators have improved 
significantly based on the current situation of the company. Using the Pareto diagram and the root cause analysis, it 
can be seen that indicators such as stockouts (65%), low product quality (25%) and missed deadlines (10%), are the 
three main reasons for the low level of service (70%). The correct application of the 5s in the finished product 
warehouse managed to reduce the number of imperfect orders delivered. In summary, the percentage of orders 
delivered in an erroneous way was 25% thanks to the 5S philosophy, reduced to 7%. The economic losses presented 
by the company are based on, which generates losses of material and orders. Therefore, it is sought that through the 
implementation of MRP, 5S and Jidoka it will be possible to save a total of 25,363.53 soles with respect to the current 
situation monthly. Which represents an improvement of 77%.

Abstract 
The foam furniture paint industry, belonging to the manufacturing sector, has experienced a decline in recent years 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation has negatively impacted production capacity and has generated 
significant challenges. Among them, reprocessing has occurred due to undesired tones in the paints, the presence of 
residues in the machines, as well as errors in machinery programming and delays in the start of production. These 
factors have hindered the manufacturing sector from reaching its pre-crisis economic level. Consequently, delays in 
the delivery of the final product arise, leading to economic losses for the companies, which hinder their development. 
To address these issues and thereby reduce product delivery times, the production improvement model based on Lean 
Manufacturing tools is proposed. The model consists of tools such as 5S, Poka-Yoke, and standardized work. The 
model was validated through the implementation of pilot tests and simulation using Arena software.

1. Introduction
Small and medium enterprises represent more than 90% of active businesses in Latin America, generating over 60% 
of employment in the region. Their proper functioning is crucial for the growth of the countries in this region, where 
they contribute to more than 28% of the average GDP (CAF, 2023). However, these enterprises often face significant 
challenges, especially concerning the efficiency of their supply chain and product delivery times. Timely delivery of 
manufactured goods is crucial for customer satisfaction and market competitiveness (Akimov, 2019). Manufacturing 
SMEs are in a particularly challenging position, as they must meet delivery deadlines despite having limited resources 
and capabilities compared to larger companies in the sector. Therefore, it is essential to develop specific optimization 
models that cater to the needs and characteristics of these SMEs (Afflerbach et al., 2020). 
The identified problem, according to the literature, can arise from various inefficiencies within the company 
(Chatzistamoulou et al.,2022). A specific example can be observed in the context of a metal-mechanical company

The implementation of simulation using the Arena program has had a significant impact on improving on-time 
deliveries at the company. Before the simulation, only 69.8% of the orders were fulfilled on the scheduled date, but 
after the implementation, delivery efficiency increased dramatically, reaching a fulfillment rate of 91.8%, considering 
that the standard time per order to produce was equal to or less than 20 hours. 
 
Table 5. Results of the indicators 
 
 
 
The use of simulation allowed for identifying the outcomes of the implemented Lean Manufacturing tools. For 
instance, the mixing operation experienced a reduction from 36.5 to 18.5 hours in processing times, enabling the 
completion of more orders in less time, thanks to the implementation of Poka-Yoke. Additionally, the homogenization 
operation saw a decrease from 14.9 to 2.6 hours, due to the implementation of the 5S methodology. 
 
These tangible results support the effectiveness of simulation with the Arena program in enhancing on-time deliveries. 
The company will continue to utilize this powerful tool to further optimize production, ensuring that customers receive 
their orders as agreed upon and strengthening their reputation as reliable suppliers in the furniture foam paint market 
(Table 5). 
 
5. Discussion 
Two scenarios were validated, comparing the current scenario with the improved scenario after the implementation of 
the pilot tests and simulation. It's worth noting that the implementation of the tools had a designated duration of 3 
months. 
 
6. Conclusions 
In conclusion, the implementation of the 5S tool has been pivotal in reducing delivery times, leading to a significant 
improvement, and positioning the company competitively in the market. The positive transformation in space and 
resource management has boosted productivity and adherence to agreed-upon customer deadlines. Likewise, the use 
of Poka-Yoke has proven effective in preventing errors and defects in the process, with employees showing 
commitment to identifying sources of error and proposing solutions, fostering a culture of continuous improvement 
within the company. 
 
Furthermore, through flowcharts and detailed documentation, rigorous sales control has been achieved, resulting in a 
substantial reduction in fines due to delivery delays. This has minimized errors and ensured consistent and high-quality 
production. Work standardization has had a positive impact, providing greater consistency in the company's results. 
In summary, the implementation of these three tools has generated a positive impact on Onyx International, leading 
to efficiency, quality, and profitability. The waste reduction from 5S, the use of Poka-Yoke to prevent errors, and the 
work standardization with detailed documents have been key in satisfying the company's customers.

Abstract 
In today’s global competitive situation, every industry (irrespective of its size) is compelled to optimize their 
production processes, with a focus on delivering high-quality products in most cost-effective and efficient manner 
while ensuring swift delivery. This is continuously forcing every industry for adopting diverse manufacturing 
strategies. Lean Production System (LPS) is one such manufacturing strategy that can be adopted and monitored 
continuously to eliminate non-value activities, thereby facilitating the efficient and swift production of cost-effective 
and high-quality goods. It is observed from the analysis of the literature that most of the large manufacturing industries 
have successfully implemented LPS. However, in general, Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) often struggle to 
effectively implementing LPS. This is mainly due to the non-availability of literature support to indicate the list of 
vital enablers and ranking of the same towards implementation of LPS in SME. This study is attempting to address 
this research gap. To address this research gap, this study follows the research activities (a) identification of all possible 
list of enablers which would impact the implementation of LPS in SME, (b) determination of ‘vital enablers’ from the 
identified list of enablers, and (c) finding the ranking of the determined vital enablers by applying an integrated 
Multicriteria Decision-making Methods (MCDM). Particularly this study demonstrates the workability of the 
integrated AHP-BWM methods for finding ranking of the determined vital enablers for implementing LPS in SME.

1. Introduction
In today's global market, characterized by intense competition, SME are encountering challenges in maintaining their 
competitiveness. To remain competitive, SME must enhance their organizational efficiency by reducing various forms 
of waste, which are categorized as non-value added in Lean Production System (LPS). Therefore, the effective 
implementation of LPS in SME becomes crucial. Further, existing literature provides ample evidence that SME can 
indeed benefit from LPS if they can successfully tailor its principles to suit their individual needs and circumstances 
(Hu et al., 2015). 
To ensure the effective implementation of LPS in SME, it is essential to identify key enablers. The review of the 
literature reveals that many researchers have identified different sets of enablers for implementing LPS in various 
industries. However, there is a lack of a universally applicable, vital set of enablers that transcends industry types. 
This literature gap also highlights the absence of a clear understanding of the relative importance and priority 
weightage of these enablers. To address this research gap, the authors employ a Multicriteria Decision Method 
(MCDM) to weigh and rank all the enablers.

Abstract 
Substantial capital investments in vital assets, particularly power transformers, necessitate the application of precise 
diagnostics. These diagnostics are crucial for assessing performance, identifying potential issues, and ensuring these 
assets' long-term operational and maintenance efficiency. The primary objective is proactively mitigating asset failure 
risk and the subsequent need for costly replacements. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing 
AI models for fault classification, primarily leveraging machine learning methodologies. However, a notable 
characteristic of many machine learning approaches is their inherent black-box nature, which limits their 
interpretability. The opacity of these models necessitates adopting Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) 
techniques to elucidate their decision-making processes. In this study, we have explored the application of various 
machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random 
Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), for fault classification. 
Among these models, the Random Forest algorithm yielded the most promising results. We applied XAI approaches 
to enhance our understanding of its decision-making mechanisms and facilitate better-informed decision-making.

1. Introduction
Fault detection and diagnosis in transformers are crucial for maintaining and managing power systems. Transformers 
are critical for power distribution, and any problem can cause power disruption, equipment damage, and human safety 
risks (Sharma et al. 2011; Faiz and Soleimani 2018). Therefore, it is essential to find and understand the issues to 
prevent failures to keep the power system running smoothly. Earlier, Transformer Fault Diagnosis depended on visual 
examinations, electrical assessments, and hands-on approaches (Stone 2005). These approaches require a significant 
amount of time and money, and they may not always be successful in identifying potential problems or assessing a 
transformer's condition. AI approaches have been recognized as a promising strategy in transformer fault diagnosis. 
These approaches can analyze complex datasets and identify trends and abnormalities that may indicate transformer 
faults (Li et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023).  
For better accuracy in fault diagnosis, complex machine-learning approaches are frequently used. As the complexity 
of machine learning algorithms increases, they tend to behave like ""black boxes,"" making them less transparent. When 
we give inputs to the algorithm, it provides the outputs, but without a clear understanding, the algorithm's inner 
workings remain hidden (Matzka 2020). In this situation, Explainable AI (XAI) becomes helpful. XAI improves the 
transparency and interpretability of machine learning models. In the context of power transformer fault diagnosis, 
XAI is also crucial. It gives us confidence in the model's decisions and helps us understand why the model chose a 
particular choice. This transparency is critical because it helps us detect and treat transformer issues early on,

6. Conclusion  
In this study, we have explored the application of various machine learning algorithms for transformer fault diagnosis, 
explicitly focusing on enhancing the interpretability of the algorithms. The results demonstrate that the random forest 
excelled compared to other algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately classifying transformer health. 
The high precision, recall, and F1-score values for both the ""No Fault"" and ""Fault"" categories underscore the 
robustness of the Random Forest model. Through local explanations, we gained valuable insights into the model's 
decision-making process for individual data points. Specific features and their values were examined to understand 
their influence on predictions. Furthermore, we employed global explanation techniques such as SHAP (SHapley 
Additive exPlanations) to understand feature importance at a broader scale. Notably, features like 'OLI' (Oil Level 
Indicator), 'VL23' (Voltage Line 2-3), and 'OTI' (Oil Temperature Indicator) were identified as significant factors in 
transformer fault classification. XAI techniques like SHAP and LIME enhance the transparency of complex machine 
learning processes, fostering trust and confidence in AI-driven decision-making. Applying XAI techniques is vital for 
ensuring the reliability and safety of power systems. 
 
In conclusion, our research provides a data-driven approach to preventing failures and improving power transformer 
reliability. Machine learning algorithms, interpretability techniques, and domain-specific knowledge work well to 
enhance transformer fault diagnosis and maintenance practices. As the power sector continues to evolve, integrating 
AI and XAI will be pivotal in ensuring the stability and efficiency of power distribution systems. As we look to the 
future, several exciting avenues exist for further research and development in transformer fault diagnosis. One of the 
promising directions is the exploration of ensemble models and hybrid approaches. These ensemble models can 
effectively capture diverse patterns in the data, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy. A wealth of XAI techniques

Abstract 
The lack of a QMS will affect the manufacturing sector which leads to a complete failure because there will be a lot 
of wastage, rework, time wastage and loss of money. Quality assurance’s main aim is to do regular and continuous 
assessment of the general project to meet quality standards. The quality management system ISO 9001 also helps 
manufacturing companies to ensure that they comply with satisfactory production procedures and other relevant 
management measures. The study set out to put the theoretical concepts of QMS into practice in the context of 
manufacturing sector in South Africa. The research took place in Johannesburg, South Africa. The scope of this 
research was limited to quality management in the manufacturing sector (manufacturing plant and warehouses) and 
employee participation in the introduction of QMS. This research was conducted using a quantitative approach. Data 
was gathered and analyzed using descriptive analysis. This indicates that the data was collected using a well-
designed questionnaire. The results showed that QMS helps South African manufacturing organizations stay in 
business, cuts down on wasted time, and boosts customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Mehrotra (2018) opined that implementation of quality management system helps manufacturing organisation 
ensure compliance with good manufacturing practices while continuing to effectively implement quality processes 
that will advance quality performance of the employees as a key factor to providing customer’s satisfaction. The 
lack of a QMS will affect the manufacturing sector which leads to a complete failure because there will be a lot of 
wastage, rework, time wastage and loss of money (Abbie, 2015). In order for a QMS to be effective for QMS 
implementation to be effective it requires the involvement of the top management, workers training sessions, 
organisational commitment to quality, a strategic quality planning, workers participation, change of organizational 
culture, frequent review of measure performance and quality plan. In addition, Tricker (2008) stated that there are 
six principles that have to be followed in Quality Management System (QMS) in for the manufacturing sector to 
reap the full benefits of QMS. These tenets include a dedication to the customer, strong leadership, employee buy-in, 
a focus on process, the establishment of strong bonds, constant attention to quality, and the use of data to inform 
decisions. Abbie et al. (2015) stated that although there are also factors that the prevents the adoption of QMS in the 
manufacturing sector this include money shortage, support program shortage, lack of customer focus, lack of 
documentation, non-assistance from top management as well as quality cost misunderstanding. These issues have to 
be addressed in the manufacturing in order to always satisfy customers. Many industries use the ISO 9001 system to

population, the benefits of quality management system in South African manufacturing sectors in the order of 
hierarchy are: enables the company to remain in business, reduce time wastage, promotes customer satisfaction, 
reduce cost, enables continuous improvement, enables finance savings, promotes teamwork, eradicates loss of 
customers, reduce wastage and rework, reduces goods and services rejection, promote the company’s productivity 
and efficiency, enables cooperation, enhances operation performance indicators to measure the quality and cost of 
goods, create faithful clients, improves communication among workers, and increases competitive advantage. This 
result is paramount as it will help the manufacturing industry to appreciate quality management system. Based on 
this submission, it is recommended that the South African manufacturing industry should have a body in form of 
compliance officers who will be checking the activities and commitments of the workers towards quality 
management. This proactive measure will definitely mitigate the barriers of low management commitment. Future 
research using a larger sample size and expanding the research location is required in light of the fact that this study 
was only conducted in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Additionally, other sectors can be researched to see if 
the findings hold true.

Abstract 
The implementation of quality management system (QMS) helps manufacturing organization ensure compliance 
with good manufacturing practices. However, the lack of a QMS will affect the manufacturing sector and lead to a 
complete failure because there will be a lot of wastage, rework, time wastage and loss of money. To ensure QMS is 
incorporated into the manufacturing sector, this study is focused on assessing the barriers facing the application of 
QMS in South African manufacturing organisations. This was achieved by employing a quantitative research 
methodology with the distribution of questionnaire to professionals in the manufacturing organisations across South 
Africa. The retrieved data was analysed using descriptive statistics and the findings revealed that the top five 
barriers to QMS application by manufacturing organisations in South Africa are top management low commitment, 
lack of required finance, shortage of experts, lack of training, and lack of the QMS process understanding during 
training sessions. It was concluded that QMS contributes largely to the success of manufacturing industry in South 
Africa and there is a need to make necessary provisions for its incorporation into the industry process. It was 
recommended that organisations need to pay attention to the identified barriers of this study with top management 
making adequate commitment to the application of QMS in the manufacturing industry of South Africa. This will 
help promote QMS adoption.

1. Introduction
Through the consolidation process of employees and organizational performance, a company's effective capabilities 
and efficiency can attain peak performance to enhance the firm's capacity for long-term growth, sustainability and 
improve the quality of customers and stakeholders (Evans and Lindsay, 2013). Mehrotra (2018) argues that the 
implementation of quality management system helps manufacturing organization ensure compliance with good 
manufacturing practices while continuing to effectively implement quality processes that will advance quality 
performance of the employees as a key factor to providing customer’s satisfaction. The lack of a QMS will affect the 
manufacturing sector and lead to a complete failure because there will be a lot of wastage, rework, time wastage and 
loss of money (Abbie et al., 2015). Manufacturing firms focus primarily on customer satisfaction. Customers' 
positive responses to manufactured goods are what will ensure the company's continued existence and growth in 
profit. The processes of a quality management system cannot indicate how capable or limited a staff member is. 
Businesses can maximize the benefits of employee performance by implementing quality control measures like 
these (Aquilano and Chase 1991). Companies can accurately apply cost-effective control procedures to the accurate 
development of goods and services. The reason is not to ask whether the work is correct, but the first prudent

4.3 Discussion of Findings  
The main aim of this research was to identify the barriers to the application of QMS in South African manufacturing 
organizations. Based on the analyses of the survey instrument (Questionnaire), ‘top management low commitment, 
lack of required finance, shortage of experts, lack of training, and lack of the QMS process understanding during 
training sessions are the top five barriers to the application of QMS in South African manufacturing organizations. 
The findings of this objective reflect the submission of Stanojeska et al. (2016) who argued that that non-assistance 
or low commitment from top management represents a major challenge to the success of QMS. It is also in line with 
the argument of Sebastianelli and Tamimi, (2003) who stated that a company with a financial instability cannot 
afford Quality management system. This implies that falling short of top management and financial inconsistent 
define the failure of QMS. Other barriers in the order of hierarchy are: negligence, lack of customer attractiveness, 
lack of employees’ attitude orientation, quality costs misunderstanding, organisational culture, workers’ behaviour, 
top management behaviour (lack of employee motivation), complicated administrative procedures, and unclear 
implementation process requirement. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation  
The main aim of this research was to identify the barriers to the application of QMS in South African manufacturing 
organizations. From the reviewed literatures, several barriers that limit the application of QMS were identified. 
Discoveries from the results received from the respondents uncovered how the barriers hierarchically limit the 
application in South African manufacturing organizations in the following order: top management low commitment, 
lack of required finance, shortage of experts, lack of training, lack of the QMS process understanding during training 
sessions, negligence lack of customer attractiveness, lack of employees’ attitude orientation, quality costs 
misunderstanding, organisational culture, workers’ behaviour, top management behaviour (lack of employee 
motivation), complicated administrative procedures and unclear implementation process requirement. The findings 
of this study indicated how important involvement of top managers and financial stability are to the success 
manufacturing industry in South Africa. Quality is the key to customer’s satisfaction which is executed through the 
products or services provided to them. The achievement of this quality in the South African manufacturing company 
(SAMC) induces major difficulties such as top management low commitment, lack of required finance, shortage of 
experts, lack of training, and lack of the QMS process understanding during training sessions.

Abstract 
Maritime security in the 21st century is a pressing global concern, with multifaceted challenges ranging from piracy 
to environmental crimes. This article delves into the complexities of maritime crime and security, emphasizing their 
global implications. Contemporary maritime threats have evolved in scale and intricacy, necessitating 
comprehensive and adaptive responses. Underlying factors, including economic disparities, technological 
advancements, and maritime infrastructure vulnerabilities, contribute to these threats. The international legal 
framework, while foundational, faces challenges in enforcement and adaptability. Past interventions offer lessons, 
underscoring the importance of international cooperation and interdisciplinary approaches. Maritime crime has 
profound global repercussions, influencing trade, economies, and environmental sustainability. Economic 
ramifications include inflated insurance costs and trade disruptions, while environmental consequences threaten 
marine ecosystems. Addressing these challenges demands international collaboration, as maritime issues often 
transcend national boundaries. The article underscores the significance of maritime security in our interconnected 
world, advocating for continued research, international cooperation, and decisive policy actions. The future of our 
oceans and global security hinges on collective resolve and action.

1. Introduction
In today's ever-evolving global landscape, maritime security has emerged as a paramount concern, emblematic of 
the intricate interplay between commerce, geopolitics, and transnational threats. One of the most prominent among 
these threats is maritime piracy, which poses a significant risk to both commerce and security on a global scale. 
Despite the existence of a complex framework designed to promote international cooperation on this issue, the 
collective efforts in addressing maritime piracy have often been criticized for their disorganized, ad hoc nature, 
resulting in only minimal effectiveness (Struett, Nance & Armstrong, 2013). This challenge is further compounded 
by the fact that the objectives of states and international institutions concerning maritime security are heavily 
influenced by geographical and geopolitical factors, even if these links are not explicitly articulated in official 
documents (Germond, 2015). 
The unique characteristics of the maritime domain serve to amplify these challenges. Maritime security is 
distinguished by its intrinsic interconnectedness, transnational nature, liminality—bridging both land and sea—and 
cross-jurisdictional complexities that manifest at both the national and institutional levels (Bueger, Edmunds & 
Ryan, 2019). This interconnectedness implies that maritime security issues frequently transcend the confines of 
national borders, necessitating a coordinated and collaborative approach among nations and organizations. 
Furthermore, the involvement of private actors in maritime security governance underscores the ""globalization

principles for shaping future strategies and interventions. One of the paramount lessons gleaned from historical 
efforts is the indispensable importance of reestablishing law and order ashore as a fundamental prerequisite for 
ensuring security offshore. Geopolitical instability and the divergence of national interests often present formidable 
obstacles to international maritime cooperation, underscoring the critical necessity of onshore stability for achieving 
maritime security (Potgieter & Schofield, 2010). 
 
The dynamic nature of maritime piracy, particularly in regions like Somalia, underscores the significance of 
contextual understanding. Effective efforts to combat piracy must be tailored to the unique realities of the regions 
they impact. The decline of Somali piracy serves as a compelling case study, emphasizing the interconnectedness of 
maritime security within the broader context of international security and development (Pham, 2010; Bueger, 2015). 
Another vital lesson pertains to comprehending the target selection behavior of maritime criminals. Pirates' target 
selection patterns have demonstrated consistency with other forms of crime, such as burglary and car theft. This 
suggests the applicability of strategies employed in other crime prevention domains to the maritime context, offering 
valuable insights into potential prevention measures (Townsley & Oliveira, 2015). 
Furthermore, the evolution of maritime crime, from traditional piracy to more technologically advanced threats 
involving cutting-edge technology, underscores the imperative for ongoing adaptation and innovation in response 
strategies (Menefee, 1999). Successful interventions have also underscored the significance of interdisciplinary 
cooperation. Addressing multifaceted maritime threats necessitates collaboration between entities possessing 
expertise in diverse fields, ensuring a comprehensive approach to tackling the complex challenges at hand (Gottlieb, 
2013). 
However, it is essential to acknowledge that not all endeavors have yielded success. For instance, the correlation 
between electoral competition in weak institutional settings and increased maritime piracy in Indonesia underscores 
the intricate interplay between political changes and the disruption of collusive agreements between pirates and 
government authorities. This insight highlights the need for nuanced approaches to address the root causes of piracy 
in highly competitive electoral districts (Daxecker & Prins, 2016). 
 
6. Conclusions and Recommendation 
Within the vast expanse of the world's oceans, the intricate tapestry of maritime activities holds a central role in 
shaping global geopolitics, economies, and environmental sustainability. This article has illuminated the fact that 
maritime crime and security transcend regional boundaries and are, in fact, global imperatives demanding immediate 
attention and concerted action. Several crucial takeaways emerge from this review. 
First and foremost, contemporary maritime threats, spanning from piracy to environmental crimes, have evolved in 
both complexity and scale, necessitating a multifaceted and adaptable response. The underlying factors contributing 
to these threats, including economic disparities, technological advancements, and vulnerabilities in maritime 
infrastructure, underscore the imperative for comprehensive strategies to counteract them. 
While the international legal framework governing maritime affairs boasts robust foundations, it faces considerable 
challenges in terms of enforcement and adaptability to evolving threats. Nevertheless, past experiences, marked by 
both successes and failures, offer invaluable lessons. These lessons underscore the significance of international 
cooperation, interdisciplinary approaches, and the need for continuous adaptation to the ever-changing maritime 
landscape. 
 
The global repercussions of maritime crime, spanning economic and environmental dimensions, are profound. As 
maritime activities wield influence over global trade, economies, and ecological equilibrium, the stakes are 
undeniably high. The economic consequences, ranging from inflated insurance costs to trade disruptions, ripple 
through global markets. Simultaneously, environmental impacts, encompassing issues such as illegal fishing and oil 
theft, pose a direct threat to marine ecosystems and the broader sustainability of our planet. 
Addressing these multifaceted challenges demands a united effort on multiple fronts. International cooperation and 
collaborative partnerships emerge as paramount. Given that maritime challenges invariably transcend national 
boundaries, a coordinated, global response becomes imperative. As highlighted by Bueger et al. (2019), maritime 
security in the 21st century represents an interlinked set of challenges of growing global significance, encompassing 
national, environmental, economic, and human security concerns. It is in acknowledging this interconnectedness and 
embracing a holistic approach that we can endeavour to safeguard the maritime domain and, by extension, the well-
being of our interconnected world.

Abstract 
Research on Aluminum Matrix Composites has seen an exponential growth in the recent past, as the qualities 
demonstrated by metal matrix composites are far more appealing than those of unreinforced metals. Many properties, 
such as high-temperature strength, high elastic modulus, greater stiffness, creep, and fatigue resistance, make them 
more significant for automotive and aerospace applications. Friction Stir Processing (FSP) has gained importance for 
surface generation because it does not influence the parent properties of the material. The component's surface is 
cardinal for many applications, and the product's life depends on surface properties such as wear resistance, etc. In 
this work, FSP has been used to create an AA8011/TiC surface composite, and the effect of process parameters, 
including tool rotational speed, linear movement of the tool, and dwell duration, on various surface attributes have 
been investigated. Taguchi-based Grey Relational Analysis (TGRA) has been employed to develop distinct sets of 
process parameters and optimize the response parameters simultaneously. After analyzing the obtained optimum 
results, it is concluded that TiC can be utilized as a reinforcement. FSP has proven to be a good option for producing 
AA8011/TiC surface composites. The optimal parametric setting for maximization of microhardness and grain number 
was 1000 RPM of tool rotation speed, 25 mm/min linear speed, and 35 seconds of dwell duration. The surface 
composite layer generated by the FSP process exhibits better results for both responses than the AA8011 sheets, as 
received.

1. Introduction
Aluminum Matrix Composite (AMC) products are lower in weight, have sufficient strength and mechanical qualities, 
and resist wear and corrosion (Dinaharan et al., 2020; Thangarasu et al., 2014b). AMCs find colossal applications in 
fabricating armour in the defence sector due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. The automotive industry is also 
interested in AMC due to its ease of machinability and overall appealing polished appearance (Ramnath et al., 2014). 
Aluminum can incorporate assorted reinforcing particles, and the effects are highly productive (Aynalem, 2020).  
The FSP principle (Figure. 1) allows inserting a pin profile or tool shoulder into the work material by applying an 
axial force to the tool and then moving the tool along the pre-set path at an altering traverse speed. Several tool 
geometries and tool movements are used to achieve the desired results. The friction created by the tool's relative

The Taguchi method has applied an orthogonal array of nine sets for process parameters, such as rotational speed, 
linear speed, and dwell time, to create nine specimens. After analyzing these specimens, it has been stated that TiC 
could be utilized as a reinforcement material for creating an AA8011/TiC surface composite layer. From the analysis 
of the experimental data, the following can be concluded:

 A rise in spindle speed up to 1000 rpm from 710 rpm helps increment the microhardness value. Further 
increments in spindle speed caused the dispersion of reinforcement units far from the metal matrix; hence, the 
microhardness value decreased with the rise of spindle speed between 1000 rpm and 1400 rpm.  
 An increase in the traverse speed and dwell time helps increment grain numbers, and as a result, the 
microhardness value also increases with the rise in LS and dwell time value.   
 Dwell time helps in the mixing of TiC powder in the initial stages of the FSP process and gives a start for the 
smooth run of tool movement along the predefined processing zone.  
 ANOVA analysis of the output results helps to deduce the role of the selected input parameters, and the results 
showed that all three parameters were significant. 
 The maximum microhardness and highest grain number values have been obtained at 1000 rpm, 25 mm/min, 
and 35 s dwell time using TGRA.  
 The microhardness improved from 215 HRV to 398.7 HRV, and the grain number improved from 6.34 to 8.23. 
 Traverse speed and RPM influenced the distribution of reinforcement and TiC particles. Higher RPM and LS 
values resulted in TiC particle circulation outside the metal matrix.  
 The surface composite layer generated by the FSP process exhibits better microhardness and grain number results 
than the as-received A8011 sheet.    
 
Based on their findings during the trials, the authors believe that utilizing a thin strip of aluminum to prevent TiC 
powder dispersion beyond the metal matrix could be helpful in future studies. Additionally, with the reinforcing 
material placed inside the grooves, the TIG cladding process on the profile can be done to produce the initial bond 
between the TiC particles and base metal. Instead of grooves, holes can be drilled, and reinforcement particles can be 
placed inside the drilled holes to improve TiC-base material mixing.

Abstract 
Industrial companies can generate a high number of environmental impacts, often making it challenging to assess and 
monitor corresponding aspects. The ongoing development of the Industry 4.0 concept and its associated digital tools 
can be leveraged for the measurement and real-time monitoring of specific environmental impacts. Within the scope 
of this study, we focus on the design of a real-time environmental impact measurement and monitoring system for an 
industrial production unit, utilizing certain Industry 4.0 tools such as IoT devices. Additionally, we propose a 
comprehensive design approach based on a series of steps, including the identification of environmental aspects. In the 
literature, various approaches and methods are employed for identifying environmental aspects and impacts. These 
approaches often begin with the preliminary identification of processes and activities, followed by the identification 
of environmental aspects and impacts specific to those activities. However, the number of specific activities within an 
industrial production facility can be substantial, resulting in a high number of environmental aspects and impacts, and 
subsequently, a large number of sensors required for measurement and monitoring. To minimize the sensor count, we 
suggest adopting a holistic approach for identifying environmental aspects and impacts within our design process. The 
design approach we propose, founded on a set of steps, enables the management of complexity, cost, and project 
timeline for the development of an environmental impact measurement and monitoring system for an industrial unit. 
This work builds upon some of our prior research and publications in the fields of environmental impacts and Industry 
4.0.

Abstract 
The commercial sector in Peru has a sustainable growth over time, playing an important role and projecting an average 
growth of 3% by 2025. For this reason, commercial companies must be in constant development to be able to meet 
new market demands and solve new problems. In this sense, it is crucial to identify the main causes of the problems, 
such as the low level of order fulfillment, which is directly related to disorganization and suboptimal distributions in 
the warehouse, as well as high waiting times to serve customers. This research develops an improvement proposal 
model based on three tools (5S, ABC Method and SLP) which has as its main objective to improve the level of order 
fulfillment in commercial companies, in order to improve the standard time and obsolescence. The results obtained 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model by increasing the order fulfillment level from 78.75% to 90%.

1. Introduction
In the latest INEI reports, the commercial sector presents sustainable growth over time, which is very attractive in the 
business industry. It also plays a fundamental role in the generation of employment and in the contribution of economic 
growth, regardless of their level, development or political system (ILO, 2023). In Peru, the importance of this sector 
lies in its contribution to GDP, representing 10.4% and having a growth of 3% compared to the previous period (INEI, 
2021). On the other hand, the sector witnessed a negative percentage variation of 13.3% in 2020 and a positive 
percentage variation of 17.2% in 2021 (INEI, 2023). Likewise, a report carried out by the Central Reserve Bank of 
Peru indicates that GDP growth expectations for 2025 will be 3% (Banco Central de la Reserva, 2023), which is why 
companies in this sector must be in constant preparation to meet the needs of new demands and face problems such 
as a low order fulfillment levels.

From the final indicators, we can conclude that the proposed objective was achieved since all the indicators showed 
improvements, and if the model continues to be implemented in the company, there is room for additional 
improvement. 
 
6. Conclusion 
With the results of the previous table, it is concluded that the implementation of the proposed model in the company 
under study allowed an increase in the order fulfillment level el from 78.75% to 90%, demonstrating the effectiveness 
of the model. 
 
Regarding the other indicators, it is observed that the standard time and obsolescence were significantly reduced, 
obtaining great benefits and being more competitive in the commercial market. 
 
It is important to have all the historical data on the times, especially the times in the search for spare parts, to be able 
to develop a better analysis of the indicators and thus reduce the error and have more precise information.

Abstract 
The construction industry, a vital component of national development, has faced increasing complexity and demands, 
necessitating adept project management. Despite a historical resistance to digitization, the sector is undergoing a 
transformation, catalyzed by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This shift toward progressive digitization 
aligns with the construction industry's need for innovative solutions to address challenges like workforce shortages 
and supply chain disruptions. This study introduces mobile technology in enhancing project management within the 
Philippine construction setting. Leveraging insights from industry experts, it investigates the impact of mobile 
communications and social networks on transforming communication and collaboration dynamics. As the industry 
embraces digitization, mobile platforms emerge as a crucial tool for efficient project delivery, especially in times of 
crisis. The mobile platform application is tailored to meet the unique demands of the construction industry, 
encompassing functionalities such as tracking construction teams, schedules, equipment, materials, and finances, and 
facilitating file-sharing. The implementation of this mobile system contributes to collaborative communication among 
engineers, contractors, project managers, and owners. The research findings, synthesized from this analysis, provide 
insights into the system's effectiveness as a comprehensive management platform in the construction industry. Finally, 
the paper outlines the development of a mobile solution specifically tailored to address challenges prevalent in Region 
4A, Philippines, offering a potential resolution to some of the industry's critical issues and pressures.

A Comparative Study on Heuristic Methods for 
Transportation Problem

Abstract 
Transportation cost accounts for one to two-thirds of the logistics cost for many organizations. So, minimizing the 
transportation cost in a Transportation Problem (TP) would help the organization to maximize profit. Though there 
are various methods, such as linear programming approach, network approach, transportation method, etc., available 
for addressing TP, the transportation method – particularly any simple and efficient heuristic method (which is 
expected to give very near optimal solution to TP) – is widely used as this type of method could easily be coupled 
with any another logistics/supply chain decision-making methods/tools to have an integrated decision-making process. 
Due to this, many researchers are continuously proposing simple heuristic method(s) for solving TP to get near-optimal 
solutions. However, from the analysis of the literature, it is observed that there is no good comparative study with 
good computational experiments considering all heuristic methods, which are (a) claimed as relatively ‘better heuristic 
method’ and published in reputed journals during the year 2013-2022, (b) evaluated using a large number of tiny test 
data taken from the literature, and (c) evaluated with large scale test data - generated from popular experimental design 
available in the literature. To address this research gap, this study considers 10 ‘better heuristic methods’ reported in 
the literature and proposed 4 heuristic methods. Further, from the detailed performance analyses carried out using 640 
randomly generated problem instances, this study identified the ‘best’ heuristic method(s) and the same is reported 
with insights.

1. Introduction
Transportation Problem (TP), also known as the distribution problem, is one of the widely-addressed optimization 
problems with an objective to minimize the total cost of shipping goods from origins to destinations or delivery time 
for any business organization while satisfying all the supply constraints and the demand requirements. Many 
applications which are not physically moving/sending/distributing goods from origins to destinations can also be 
formulated as a TP (Mathirajan et al. (2010); Mathirajan et al. (2021); Tayyeh and Hussien (2018).  
Though there are many solution methodologies for a TP like (a) developing network model and solving using the 
network method, (b) linear programming (LP) approach and (c) transportation method, the transportation method is 
widely used. The transportation method consists of a two-step procedure to obtain the optimal transportation cost for 
any TP. The first step is finding the initial solution using any existing heuristic method available in the literature – the 
North West Corner Method (NWCM) (Charnes et al. (1953)), Least Cost Method (LCM) (Hitchcock (1941)), Vogel’s 
Approximation Method (VAM) (Reinfeld and Vogel (1958)) etc. The second step involves implementing the 
optimality test on the initial solution found using the afore-mentioned methods using the Stepping Stone Method 
(Charnes and Cooper (1954)), Modified Distribution Method (MODI) (Dantzig (1963)) etc.

applied with TCM and BCM applied with TCM are proved to outperform the other heuristics considered in 
their study. 
 This study endorsed the earlier observation that any heuristic method coupled with TOCM is expected to yield 
results that are either equal to or superior to those achieved by the same heuristic method coupled with TCM. 
• 
 The 14 heuristic algorithms considered in our study can be grouped into 7 categories – heuristics 
applied on TCM and heuristics applied on TOCM. It is inferred that when the cost structure – range 
(R) varies, all the 7 heuristic algorithms coupled with TOCM give better results than the same heuristic 
algorithm coupled with TCM. 
• 
The above observation is consistent even when the problem size (m x n) varies, or the degree of 
imbalance (K) varies. 
One practical implication of the present study is that the best-performing set of heuristics can now be computerized in a 
decision support system (DSS) environment, as the computational time required to solve real-life sized problem takes very 
meager computational time.  
 
6. Conclusions 
This study presents a comparative analysis of the recently published heuristic methods for a traditional transportation 
problem (TP). A total of 10 existing heuristic methods along with 4 newly proposed variants of the existing heuristic 
methods are considered in this study. For this, a suitable performance analysis of all the 14 heuristic methods considered 
for the TP is carried out considering 640 randomly and systematically generated problem instances, which are generated 
from a suitable experimental design. The two variants of the recently published heuristic method SSM: SSM – TCM and 
SSM – TOCM are topping the first two places out of all the 14 heuristic methods considered in the study. The analysis of 
the results indicated that the newly proposed heuristic method in the literature – the SSM coupled with the Total Opportunity 
Cost Matrix (TOCM) overall outperforms for the TP problem.

Abstract 
Estimates for materials costs create significant variability in the final ‘as built’ cost of construction.  Getting estimates 
close to accurate from the beginning of a project reduces conflict, litigation and additional financing costs. 
Furthermore, accurate cost estimates go a long way towards ensuring the client is ultimately satisfied with the project 
on hand over.  Consequently, the task of identifying “best” supplier(s) of materials is central to construction 
procurement decision making.  The construction team needs to know who is most able to supply materials at the right 
cost, quantity, quality as well as with a high degree of certainty of delivery in order to achieve success.  Supplier 
selection is therefore a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This study utilizes a five step research 
process; (i) to identify a comprehensive set of supplier selection criteria (SSC) by conducting a wide ranging literature 
review, (ii) to determine ‘vital SSC’ by applying ‘Pareto analysis’, (iii) to apply integrated AHP (Analytical Hierarchy 
Process) -BWM (define BWM) methods for understanding ‘best versus worst SSC’, from the given set of ‘Vital SSC’ 
by applying an AHP method to establish optimal weightings for each ‘Vital SSC’, (iv) to determine optimal weights 
for a given set of suppliers around each ‘Vital SSC’ using the AHP-BWM method, and (v) establish rankings for 
suppliers.  The proposed five step process is demonstrated by collecting the required pairwise importance score for 
the set of ‘Vital SSC’ and suppliers from 10 experts. The novelty of this study is to combine the MCDM methods: 
AHP and BWM in order to enhance the decision-making process and provide a more robust and comprehensive 
approach for SSP in construction projects.

1. Introduction
The rapidly expanding population and the race of urbanization have led to a rapid development in the construction 
industry (CI). The CI is highly dependent on a substantial number of resources and energy for the development and 
operation of its projects (Karamoozian et al. (2023)). The total construction cost of any construction project can be 
classified into cost associated with (a) materials, (b) labor, and (c) overhead. Out of these three costs, the material cost 
is accounted for about 40% to 45% of the total cost in any constriction project (Agapiou et al. (1998)). By and large, 
the labor cost in construction industry is generally based on the availability of workers within the proximity. Further, 
the materials cost is the one that could provide the required flexibility in minimizing the cost of any construction 
project (Ng and Li (2006)). These indicates that identification of “best” supplier(s) of construction materials - who 
will be able to supply the construction materials at the right cost, in the right quantity, with the right quality at the right 
time - has a critical impact among various decision issues involved in construction industry (Onesime et al. (2004)).

Based on the computed aggregate weight of each supplier the Max 𝑤𝑤𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 = Max {0.4865, 0.4440, 0.0695} = 0.4865 and 
this indicates that the supplier S1 should be selected as the best supplier.  
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, we initially examined the use of MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision-Making) techniques in the context of 
construction industry. From the various available MCDM methods, we specifically selected AHP (Analytical 
Hierarchy Process) and the Best Worst Method (BWM) to determine the prioritization of factors influencing supplier 
selection in the construction industry. Our aim was to triangulate the results by using both of these methods. 
 
It is observed from the results that: the most important supplier selection criterion (SSC) in the construction industry 
is Quality (S3). It is also observed that the least important criterion is the reputation/past performance/buyer-supplier 
relationship (S5). Further, three suppliers were selected and evaluated on the basis of the ‘vital few’ SSC. Based on 
the optimal weights of the ‘vital few’ SSC obtained from AHP and weights obtained for each supplier w.r.t the ‘vital 
few’ SSC, the best supplier was identified.

Abstract 
Many logistics operators predominantly rely on diesel-powered vehicles for their delivery services. However, the 
adverse external effects of internal combustion engine vehicles have led governments and city authorities to enact 
more stringent regulations governing freight transportation within urban areas. These initiatives promote the transition 
to alternative fuel vehicles, with a primary focus on electric vehicles (EVs). Consequently, it is anticipated that EVs 
will make up a substantial portion of logistics operators' vehicle fleets. Inadequate charging infrastructure has been a 
significant impediment to the widespread adoption of EVs. Charging at the depot is a practical solution in real-world 
logistics operations due to limited recharging infrastructure in many regions and the uncertainty surrounding charger 
availability. While there may be numerous public recharging stations in the area, not all are suitable for commercial 
vehicles, especially trucks. Furthermore, some companies prefer charging their EVs at their depots due to factors like 
high energy costs at public stations. Nevertheless, this approach can result in operational inefficiencies, especially for 
deliveries in peri-urban and rural areas. To address this, offering charging services for EVs, such as deploying mobile 
chargers (MCs), can enhance the efficiency of EV usage. In other words, a flexible recharging system with an on-
demand mobile charging approach can be recommended. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with 
On-Demand Charging System to tackle these challenges. MCs recharge EV batteries at customer locations along their 
routes when necessary. We have developed a matheuristic algorithm that combines the variable neighborhood search 
(VNS) and an exact method.

Abstract 
Insurance fraud, especially automobile insurance fraud, is a common fraud topic which causes significant financial 
losses for insurance companies. Dishonest claims impose a significant financial strain on insurance companies which 
influence on the entire industry. Because of this, insurers are constantly seeking for more effective detection systems 
to get beyond the limitations of traditional techniques; therefore, building a reliable and effective fraud detection 
model is crucial to maintaining the insurance providers' financial stability and reputation. Our research paper major 
objective is to use machine learning techniques to develop a reliable system for detecting car insurance fraud. This 
study intends to examine multiple supervised machine learning algorithms using classification method, and assess 
their efficacy, to ultimately select the most accurate model with significant accuracy for identifying fraudulent 
insurance claims. 
Keywords 
Fraud Detection Model, Automobile Insurance Fraud, Financial Stability, Machine Learning and Classification 
method.  
1. Introduction
Fraud detection is a critical concern for enterprises and public institutions in various domains, including the insurance 
industry. Fraudulent claims in the automobile insurance sector can result in significant financial losses for insurers. 
Detecting fraudulent activities in the automobile insurance industry is crucial in order to minimize financial losses for 
insurers.  
One area that has received considerable attention in the field of fraud detection is automobile insurance. Automobile 
insurance fraud can occur in various forms, such as staged accidents, inflated claims, and false documentation (Palacio, 
2018). Fraudulent claims in the automobile insurance industry can lead to substantial financial losses for insurers. 
Insurers have dedicated teams to identify and combat fraudulent claims, but the detection of fraud can be challenging 
due to its complex nature and the presence of sophisticated criminals (Müller et al., 2016). Insurers employ various 
methods to detect and prevent fraud, such as manual investigations, data analysis, and the use of predictive analytics. 
In Morocco, the car industry trade has experienced substantial growth over time. Research conducted in 2020 by the 
Moroccan Association of Automobile Distributors revealed that there were over 4. million registered vehicles in 
Morocco. This was a 46% rise compared to 2010. This expansion in the automobile market has also led to an increase 
in automobile insurance claims. However, along with this growth comes the alarming issue of automobile insurance 
fraud in Morocco.

affected by the tuning process, sustaining a modest accuracy of 75%. Considering these outcomes, it becomes evident 
that Logistic Regression stands out as the most reliable choice for predicting fraudulent cases in the auto insurance 
industry, consistently delivering superior accuracy compared to its counterparts. 
 
5.4 Deployment 
Now that we have successfully identified Logistic Regression as the optimal model based on its superior performance 
on the testing data, the next pivotal stage in the machine learning pipeline is deployment. The deployment phase 
involves bringing the trained model into a production environment, enabling its integration into real-world 
applications. In our case, Flask, a micro web framework for Python, will serve as the deployment platform. Flask 
facilitates the creation of a web service, allowing seamless interaction with the trained Logistic Regression model. 
This deployment will empower stakeholders, such as insurance professionals or end-users, to make real-time 
predictions on insurance claims. The deployment process involves converting the trained model into an accessible 
API, providing a user-friendly interface for efficient and effective utilization. This deployment strategy ensures that 
the predictive capabilities of the Logistic Regression model can be harnessed for practical decision-making in the 
dynamic landscape of auto insurance. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The diverse range of machine learning algorithms tested throughout the research project culminated in the 
identification of an optimal model specifically designed to discern the authenticity of insurance claims. This model, 
strategically selected after rigorous evaluation, can serve as a potent tool for insurance companies seeking to fortify 
their defenses against fraudulent activities. The proposed solution offers a versatile framework that strikes a balance 
between simplicity, enabling efficient processing of vast datasets, and complexity, ensuring a robust and reliable 
detection mechanism. 
 
The findings of this research provide a compelling pitch for Moroccan insurance companies to adopt and customize 
the model to seamlessly integrate with their existing systems. The overarching goal is to empower these companies 
with a tailored solution that aligns with their unique operational requirements. By incorporating such a sophisticated 
yet user-friendly model, Moroccan insurance companies can elevate their ability to accurately identify and mitigate 
fraudulent claims, thereby contributing to the integrity and sustainability of the insurance industry in the face of 
evolving economic landscapes.

Abstract 
Whilst history shares that engineering is a discipline practised in a social context with engineering projects 
contributing to the well-being of communities around the world, academic engineering research is the lifeblood and 
future of any academic tradition and discipline and none more so than for engineering. The importance of academic, 
engineering research and its direct impact on our daily life cannot be underestimated but  what is providing cause for 
concern amongst engineering ethicists, is the computer technology used by engineers to interpret, analyse and 
communicate their results from their academic research.Whilst we can marvel at the design and utility of Brunel’s 
Clifton Suspension Bridge a first of its kind in Victorian times, have perhaps personally enjoyed the thrill of flying 
supersonic on Concorde, daily drive a car built by robots and make continual use of a laptop in our professional and 
personal life; we can equally appreciate the ground-breaking engineering research carried out by those involved in the 
Manhattan project and the way in which it was used to bring about an end to World War Two and the engineering 
research that led to landing a man safely on the moon in 1969. However, in so doing, perhaps what we have failed to 
consider is the level of direct human involvement in these engineering examples.  Historically, academic engineering 
research has been facilitated by human interest and the need through direct application of engineering breakthroughs 
to improve daily life. Such engineering innovation has undeniably been the direct result of human effort, intellect, 
foresight and vision with technology playing a supporting role, rather than a leading role. This paper examines the 
ethics of undertaking academic engineering research in contemporary times and the challenge artificial intelligence 
(AI) presents to the critical need to maintain academic excellence and intellectual and research integrity in the 
pedagogy and output of this academic discipline through human interest, abilities and facilitation.   
Keywords 
Intellectual integrity, engineering, research integrity, academic excellence, Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
1. Introduction
Albert Einstein (2023) perhaps the greatest scientist of the twentieth century is reported to have said; “The human 
spirit must prevail over technology” which for many concurs with the sentiments of Schwab (2016) who suggests; 
“The big challenge for most societies will be how to absorb and accommodate the new modernity, 
whilst embracing the nourishing aspects of our traditional value systems. (2016:97)  
It is perhaps this sentiment veiled in moral philosophy that strikes a chord in the hearts of engineering academics as 
we look at the future of academic excellence and intellectual and research integrity in our discipline, both arguably 
battling on the front-line of technology and its associated ethics. To this end, many contemporary engineering 
researchers find themselves at the intersection of the legitimation of technology and the extent of the digital resources 
now available to them and the ethical dilemmas even ethical conflicts that can arise with regards to how and when to 
use them during their academic research.

Ethicists have successfully argued the lack of beneficence arising from the use of ChatGPT in academic research 
which can be seen to actively challenge, and in some cases, even subvert both the notion and reality of academic 
excellence and research and intellectual integrity owing to its technical and language capabilities. In so doing, not only 
does it challenge the truth as it has been claimed by Ganesh (2023) that ChatGPT, “...can generate coherent and 
engaging text on almost any topic” (2023) but also the authenticity and the unique ‘voice’ of the engineering researcher 
that should accompany their final research product. Moreover ChatGPT, dispenses with the pedagogy long associated 
with academic research and through a series of short-cuts, aims to produce a final piece of research that if compared 
with previous research from the same engineering researcher undertaken before late 2022 can stand accused of 
possessing none of the ‘human’ nuances expected and associated with their final research product, nor encompass any 
of the virtues associated with the engineering researcher who successfully undertook such academic research.   
 
3.6 The Use of Artificial Intelligence in The Research Process 
It has been claimed that AI can arguably be seen to ‘shadow’ the human effort. This is evident in engineering research 
specifically when it comes to sorting, assessing, coding and reviewing both sources and the content of the final research 
paper.; essentially processes contained in pit-stops 1 and 2 of the engineering research journey.  
 
To this end, it could be argued that AI software such as Grammarly, Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, Coggle, Trinka and 
Turnitin, when used responsibly, can benefit both existing academic research pedagogy and the engineering researcher 
actively pursuing their research. In short in such instances, the responsible use of any or all of these AI models is best 
viewed as a time-saving resource for the engineering researcher that mirrors activities associated with human research 
activity which serves the method and process of their research well. In taking on the broader functions of improving 
accuracy and providing an accessible means of compliance with academic conventions and protocols, AI can also 
bring about a positive influence on the research process, particularly in areas such as plagiarism, collective 
brainstorming, referencing, citations and review.  
 
However, it is when one comes to unique writing skills, imaging and coding abilities in pit-stop 3 of the engineering 
research journey that AGI such as ChatGPT creates a very real ethical dilemma/conflict in terms of directly 
challenging academic excellence and academic research and intellectual integrity.  
 
ChatGPT employs ‘natural language processing’ (NLP) This manifests as an interactive large language-based model 
(LLM) that employs human interaction in the form of feedback. The dialogue format between user and AI Chatbot 
has been further entrenched using ‘reinforcement learning from human feedback’ (RLHF) which has provided an 
understanding between user and Chatbot that allows greater clarification to expose ambiguous queries and provide 
greater clarification between user and AI enabling increased accuracy of responses and a more acceptable end product. 
The result is an AI generated piece of research incorporating AI generated code, images, algorithmic bias and words 
that lacks researcher authenticity in addition to academic and intellectual integrity. Neither does AI generated research 
provide the researcher with insight, self-reflection or showcase critical thinking which are the expected by-products 
of the academic research process and resulting academic research.  
 
Indeed, not one of the seven skills identified by Lester & Lester (2015) can be gained by an engineering researcher if 
their academic research is subverted by the use of AI in pit-stop 3 of the research process. Such skills are not required 
by a machine  
 
‘prompted’ to ‘fine tune’ and perfect the final research product. Such skills are focussed towards the individual 
engineering researcher and their development in terms of academic excellence and their intellectual and research 
integrity.   
 
4. Conclusion  
It is perhaps to MacIntyre (2002) the contemporary philosopher who has revived the study of Aristotelian virtue that 
we  
find ourselves intrinsically drawn when viewing contemporary dilemmas in academic research in engineering. Even 
more  
so, when navigating the difficulties of marrying the integrity of the method and process of academic research 
alongside the abilities of contemporary technology and AI models in particular. MacIntyre exhorts;  
241","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
The future for governance frameworks of both tertiary institutes and academic publishers should arguably be 
fast-tracked and be synergistic to the extent that academic excellence can be quantified and intellectual and 
research integrity formalised in an ethics framework. This will preclude the indiscriminate use of generative 
AI models such as ChatGPT that stands accused of denying academic excellence and most importantly denying 
intellectual and academic integrity.

Abstract 
Over the past decade there has been a call for action to reduce the emissions which have contributed to global warming 
and climate change. Many countries and organizations have invested in renewable resources like solar, wind and 
hydropower to produce energy in a sustainable way. In recent years, an interest has been taken in hydrogen. This paper 
highlights the benefits of hydrogen and more specifically green hydrogen which is hydrogen produced using renewable 
resources. It highlights the current challenges such as production of hydrogen at large scale and the cost of production. 
During research, the benefits of hydrogen were discovered and the lack of knowledge especially in the public sector 
were observed. To help create awareness and highlight the future prospects of hydrogen, Microsoft Power BI data 
visualization tool was used to create an interactive dashboard which can be used to create awareness between the users 
and to encourage them to adopt renewable energies. Certain countries and companies were highlighted for taking the 
prominent role in the production of hydrogen and paving the way for others to follow with their findings. With the 
increase in awareness between communities, it is predicted that government and other entities will be encouraged to 
explore clearer energy such as hydrogen. It was recommended that in the future when the cost of hydrogen has 
decreased it can be used to tackle large sectors like heavy duty industrial and transportation.

1. Introduction
In the current modernized and technological world, there is a deep concern regarding the impact of the emissions that 
have dramatically increased since the industrial revolution. The impact of the human contributions to the emissions 
have recently been recurring with more frequent extreme weather events and the rise in global surface temperature, 
leading to an increase in mortality rate of all living organisms. There has been an increase in demand for call to action 
for more environmentally friendly alternatives to the products and processes used. A heavy push with funding is placed 
on renewable energy such as wind, solar and hydropower with many countries adopting these to power their 
infrastructure.

benefits over gasoline-powered vehicles. AFVs are more fuel-efficient, which can save consumers money on fuel 
costs. AFVs also produce fewer emissions than gasoline-powered vehicles, which can improve air quality and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are also some challenges associated with the adoption of AFVs. One 
challenge is that the cost of AFVs is often higher than the cost of gasoline-powered vehicles. Another challenge is the 
limited availability of public charging infrastructure for AFVs. 
 
6. Conclusion & Recommendations 
To conclude, the issue of global warming and climate change have become increasingly relevant with the impact now 
more visible to the human population. Several international organizations have pushed for investment in renewable 
energy like green hydrogen. This papers looked into the benefits of green hydrogen which range from being carbon 
neutral to being a great source of energy storage. Data was collected from organizational databases and filtered. It was 
communicated through the Microsoft Power BI software which is a data visualization software. It was used create an 
interactive dashboard which presented information on emissions reduction, production of hydrogen, economical 
potential of green hydrogen and forecasted data relevant to use of green hydrogen. From the data it was summarized 
that hydrogen is a great source which can help make industries like transportation reduce emissions. However, at the 
current time the challenges include producing hydrogen at a large scale and at an economically feasible price. 96 % 
of world’s hydrogen in 2021 was produced using non-renewable resources. However, with a push on sustainability 
around the world, many researchers have started to look into ways in which hydrogen can be produced, stored and 
utilized for different industries using renewable energies only. The forecasted date reflected that the hydrogen storage 
market size is bound to continue increasing with the technological advancements and new information gathered about 
hydrogen. The dashboard was also used to present data on countries which have the highest number of hydrogen 
facilities and companies which are leaders of hydrogen producers currently. 
 
Further research was carried out on specific countries like the US where the growth in the number of alternative fueling 
stations in the United States is a positive development. In addition, the data shows that the number of AFVs in 
operation is growing steadily. It is a sign that the country is moving towards a more sustainable transportation system. 
However, there is still more work to be done. One of the biggest challenges facing the alternative fueling industry is 
the high cost of building and maintaining alternative fueling stations. This is especially true for EV charging stations, 
which can be very expensive to install. The article discussed many challenges surrounding adoption of green hydrogen 
such as but not limited to cost, grid integration, technological advancements, developing infrastructure and lack of 
market development. Another challenge facing renewable energies and green hydrogen is the lack of public awareness. 
Many people are not aware of the benefits or the potential of green hydrogen as an energy source. The government 
can play a role in addressing these challenges by providing subsidies and other financial incentives for the construction 
and maintenance of alternative fueling stations and funding projects for hydrogen. The government can also raise 
public awareness of alternative fuel vehicles and green hydrogen through education and outreach campaigns. While 
challenges remain, the data suggests a promising future for hydrogen as a key component of the global energy 
landscape. Continued investments and policy support are crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth 
of hydrogen infrastructure.

Abstract 
Carbon emission is a huge challenge for the world to combat climate change and achieve the Paris Agreement targets. 
To address this challenge, it is important to retrofit existing buildings towards net zero carbon (NZC). Many studies 
have focused on different aspects of building retrofitting towards NZC. However, a study that systematically examines 
the knowledge domain of building retrofitting towards NZC is lacking. This study aims to analyze the existing research 
domain of NZC retrofitting through a bibliometric analysis and provide pathways for future research. Based upon 517 
relevant articles identified from Scopus, bibliometric analysis was conducted using the VOSviewer and Gephi 
software tools. Findings revealed the collaboration networks between authors, countries, organizations, and keywords 
in this research domain. R.F. De Masi and G.P. Vanoli are the two authors with the highest link strength, while the 
University of Naples Federico II has the highest number of NZC retrofitting publications. In addition, Italy is the 
country with the highest number of publications, but China is the most productive country when it comes to both 
publications and citations combined. “Energy efficiency”, “energy saving”, “nearly zero energy building”, “net zero 
energy”, and “renewable energy” are the most prioritized research areas. Based on identified gaps, future research 
directions are proposed to include (1) integration of modern technology to simulate NZC retrofitting; (2) optimization 
of sustainable measures to achieve NZC buildings; and (3)quantification of drivers and benefits of NZC retrofitting. 
The findings of this study would be useful to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners who are interested in NZC 
retrofitting.

grants and university exchange programs. In addition, participating in conferences, webinars, and workshops will also 
help to improve the collaborations within the research domain. 
 
The analysis of keyword co-occurrence in the NZC retrofitting research domain revealed the significant trends and 
emerging research areas within the domain. Accordingly, identified keywords were categorized into eight categories: 
(1) attempted countries, (2) building types, (3) motivation, (4) benefits, (5) factors to consider before retrofitting, (6) 
retrofitting measures, (7) simulation and evaluation, and (8) deciding methods and optimization. This categorization 
provides valuable inputs to the NZC retrofitting research domain highlighting the key areas focused within the domain. 
Based on the keywords analysis, it is evident that implementation of modern technologies such as Digital Twin and 
Artificial Intelligence is still lacking within the domain. The availability of different retrofitting measures and the 
different building types indicate the necessity of optimization methods to select the most suitable retrofitting measures 
for the different building types. Therefore, the findings of this study will be valuable for future researchers to identify 
the research gaps as well as for practitioners and policy makers to make collaborations with various countries and 
organizations to implement the concept of NZC retrofitting. .  
 
However, there are limitations to this study. The study only selected the articles consisting of the developed search 
string and the articles without those keywords that have significantly contributed to the research domain are not 
included in this study. In addition, only the Scopus database was selected for this study and the selected articles were 
limited to the publications between 2015 and 2023 (October). Apart from those limitations, the findings from the study 
may contribute to both theoretical and practical implementation. The findings from the co-authorship analysis can be 
used by upcoming researchers as well as currently available researchers within the domain to create collaborations 
with various organizations and authors. Further, the research students can use the findings to participate in various 
conferences and apply for research grants. In addition, the co-occurrence of keywords can be used to enhance the 
research interest towards the NZC retrofitting. Therefore, research students can use these data for their upcoming 
research to identify the research gaps available in the NZC retrofitting domain. Hence, this study will be a valuable 
addition for the researchers to enhance the research network within the NZC retrofitting research domain.

Abstract 
This paper analyses supplier selection criteria—economic, environmental, and social—to discover which criteria is a 
possible catalyst toward competitiveness in family-owned manufacturing enterprises. Family enterprises are essential 
to the national and even international economies. Enterprises are now forced to look beyond the conventional approach 
of decision-making, which was based on intuition and past knowledge, due to the extremely competitive market. An 
enterprise must be competitive to guarantee that the clients obtain greater value from the enterprise than from 
competitors. The rapid growth of competitiveness has changed the economic landscape for many industries, especially 
manufacturing. A survey questionnaire was created to perform quantitative research among the employees of family-
owned enterprises in the manufacturing sector of South Africa. Employee assessments of their comprehension of the 
terms ""competitiveness"" and ""supplier selection criteria—economic, environmental, and social"" served as the 
analytical unit. The questionnaire included 154 respondents as a sample. A path analysis is employed to test these 
constructs. The research objectives are to evaluate the impact of supplier selection on competitiveness, particularly in 
manufacturing family-owned enterprises, and to identify potential catalysts between supplier selection criteria and 
competitiveness. Although supplier selection research is becoming more prevalent, it is still in its infancy in South 
Africa. By including supplier selection criteria, competitive aspects like quality, delivery, price, dependability, and  
flexibility have been reinterpreted. The scope of this unit of analysis is inherently limited. This study only took into 
account family-owned manufacturing enterprises located in the West Rand district of Gauteng Province, South 
Africa. This study has brought to light which of the criteria is 
a 
catalyst 
on 
competitiveness. 
This will support decision-making for supply chain professionals in family-owned enterprises.

Abstract 
Encompassing a subset of multi-objective scheduling challenges, the multi-agent scheduling problem involves various 
agents, each entrusted with a unique set of tasks while striving to optimize their individual goals. Recent inquiries in 
this field have predominantly spotlighted variable processing times, employing methods like the 𝜖𝜖-constraint approach 
to optimize one agent's function without compromising the other’s limit. Our study takes an innovative approach, 
delving into a two-agent single-machine scheduling problem influenced by concurrent learning and deterioration 
effects. The primary aim is to minimize the overall weighted completion time for both agents, preventing any job 
delays for the second agent. To address this, our research amalgamates the 𝜖𝜖-constraint and linear combination 
approaches, presenting a unique proposition in the current research landscape. We introduce a two-stage methodology: 
a heuristic method for near-optimal solutions followed by a branch-and-bound algorithm, integrating specialized 
dominance rules to achieve optimal solutions.

1. Introduction
In classical scheduling problems, job processing times are assumed to remain constant and stable. However, in 
practical situations, these processing times can fluctuate due to factors such as job repetitions or variations in resource 
allocation. The literature categorizes variations in processing times into three primary groups: time-dependent 
processing times, position-dependent processing times, and controllable processing times (Agnetis et al., 2014). 
Time-dependent processing times are determined by when a job begins processing, while position-dependent 
processing times are influenced by the job's starting position or row. Additionally, processing times can sometimes be 
altered by adjusting the number of allocated resources, leading to jobs with controllable processing times. Time-
dependent processing times can further be classified into two subgroups: non-decreasing, where processing times 
increase as jobs are delayed (referred to as jobs under deterioration effect), and non-increasing, where processing 
times decrease with delays (referred to as jobs under shortening effect). Position-dependent processing times are 
categorized into non-decreasing (jobs under aging effect) and non-increasing (jobs under learning effect) groups based 
on worker experience. Furthermore, certain jobs, particularly those in project management, allow for variations in

8. Conclusion 
This paper presented a methodology designed to address the challenging multi-agent scheduling problem involving 
jobs subject to the simultaneous influence of learning and deterioration effects. The primary objective of this problem 
was to minimize the total weighted completion time for all agents while enforcing the constraint that no tardy jobs 
were permissible for the second agent. 
 
The proposed methodology was structured into two key phases: an initial heuristic for generating an initial solution 
and a subsequent branch-and-bound algorithm for refining and optimizing the solution further. To enhance the 
efficiency of the branch-and-bound algorithm and reduce its computational complexity, a set of dominance rules and 
pruning rules were introduced. 
 
The computational results showcased the effectiveness of the branch-and-bound algorithm, particularly when coupled 
with the initial heuristic solution. Notably, this approach demonstrated commendable performance in terms of the 
number of nodes generated and execution time across a range of experiments. The methodology was rigorously tested 
with up to 15 jobs, revealing that its success was notably influenced by factors such as a smaller learning coefficient, 
a larger deterioration coefficient, and reduced slack time intervals for jobs belonging to agent B. 
 
In summary, this study offers a promising methodology for tackling complex multi-agent scheduling problems 
characterized by the simultaneous influence of learning and deterioration effects. The proposed approach, combining 
heuristic and branch-and-bound techniques, provides a robust foundation for efficiently solving such problems, with 
its performance particularly favorable under certain parameter conditions.

Oman's pivotal role in international commerce, deciphering the impact of digital innovations in its cold chain logistics 
is of paramount importance (Khan & Al-Saidi, 2020). This research endeavors to dissect the impediments and 
opportunities linked to the infusion of digital methodologies within Oman's temperature-sensitive logistics.  Guiding 
this exploration are three specific objectives: (1) Exploring the digital readiness and challenges of Oman's cold chain: 
Conversations with industry players, logistics aficionados, and cold chain specialists will reveal the existing digital 
backdrop and its associated challenges. A meticulous analysis of current logistics records will elucidate the potential 
and implications of digital enhancements. (2) Highlighting apt digital strategies and their resonance in the Omani 
landscape: A rigorous literature exploration, paired with dialogues with experts, will unveil cutting-edge digital tools, 
their worldwide applications, and their suitability for Oman's distinctive cold chain environment. (3)Crafting a 
roadmap for the digital transformation of Oman's cold chain operations: Questionnaires targeting logistics experts and 
stakeholder interactions will gauge the current state of digital assimilation, understanding, and necessities. These 
insights will craft a foundation for pragmatic guidelines and advice for effective digital adoption. This scholarly 
endeavor aims to amplify understanding regarding the digital horizon in Oman's cold chain domain. Its insights aspire 
to enlighten logistics experts, decision-makers, and industry stakeholders, ensuring Oman carves its niche in the realm

Abstract 
In recent years, the concepts of SSCM and sustainability performance (SP) have gained significant attention in both 
academics and industry. Organizations across the globe are striving to adopt sustainable practices in their supply chain 
operations. While much research has focused on developed countries, this study aims to explore the practices and 
dimensions of sustainability, sustainable performance, and the interactions between SSCM and SP in the 
manufacturing industries of EDEs. This research adopts a systematic literature review approach to identify the current 
state of knowledge on dominant dimensions of SSCM, SP, and the SSCM-SP interactions. The findings reveal that 
these factors revolve around environmental, social, and economic dimensions following the TBL principles. However, 
environmental practices are still the dominantly investigated aspects of sustainability research with social aspects 
having relatively lower consideration. Moreover, this study investigates the SP dimensions mainly investigated by 
extant literature and identifies eight dimensions. The extant literature has principally measured SP in terms of 
environmental, social, and economic dimensions. However, the operational performance dimension is 
underrepresented in the literature despite theoretical assumptions. Furthermore, the study results reveal that the SSCM-
SP nexus in the context of manufacturing industries in EDEs remains inconsistent despite the disproportional skewness 
towards the positive link. The study also reveals that environmental and social performance positively affect economic 
performance. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing insights into SSCM and SP. Ultimately, 
improving SSCM practices in these regions can lead to environmental preservation, social well-being, and economic 
growth.

1. Introduction
The advent of digitization and Industry 4.0 has wrought transformative changes in the realm of corporate quality 
management methodologies. The conceptual emergence of Quality 4.0 has precipitated a paradigmatic shift, wherein 
conventional approaches are yielding ground to the integration of Enterprise Quality Management Software (EQMS). 
Particularly discernible is the adoption of EQMS in sectors characterized by rigorous quality management systems, 
most notably in industries such as aerospace and defense, wherein compliance with the AS9100 standard is paramount. 
AS9100, as an augmentation of the ISO 9001 framework, introduces supplementary requirements encompassing 
configuration management, risk management, product safety, and counterfeit parts prevention. The inherent intricacy 
of AS9100 mandates meticulous documentation and process management, emphasizing a nuanced focus on risk 
management, continuous risk assessment in dynamic sectors, and the critical significance of supply chain

• The Ballistic Test Management Module is a bespoke solution designed to efficiently oversee the intricate 
processes associated with ballistic testing of composite ceramic armors. Tailored to the company's specific 
requirements, this module is a key tool for orchestrating and scrutinizing ballistic testing procedures. The 
broader context emphasizes the pivotal role of ballistic standards, serving as benchmarks for assessing the 
performance attributes of both ammunition and armor materials. These standards, exemplified by STANAG 
(Standardization Agreement) within NATO countries, ensure seamless interoperability and optimal functioning 
of military equipment and materials. The module's purposeful design facilitates meticulous organization of 
ballistic tests and vigilant monitoring of outcomes specific to composite ceramic armors under production. This 
involves not only ensuring adherence to ballistic standards but also providing a nuanced understanding of the 
intricate dynamics between ammunition and armor. The module emerges as a specialized and indispensable 
asset, empowering the company to fortify its quality control processes and ensure the steadfast alignment of its 
products with exacting high-performance standards. 
 
• Stock Management Module  is seamlessly integrated with the ERP system, providing a comprehensive 
framework for the efficient oversight of both semi-finished goods and finished products. It meticulously records 
stock information, including parametric specifications, ensuring a detailed and organized approach to stock 
management. In adherence to the company's philosophy, classifications such as 'quality' or 'non-quality' are 
eschewed. Instead, each production batch is tailored to either meet or not meet the specific needs and 
requirements of individual customers. For example, if an armor produced to STANAG 4 standards is deemed 
unsuitable based on test results, it may still be applicable for a customer seeking a product compliant with 
STANAG 3 standards. This nuanced approach allows for the definition of stocks based on parametric attributes, 
taking into account data from the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The objective is to 
ensure a sophisticated understanding of product capabilities, facilitating flexible adaptation to meet diverse 
customer requirements. This approach optimizes stock management, aligning it with stringent quality 
parameters. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The rise of digitization and Industry 4.0 has brought about significant transformations in corporate quality 
management methodologies. The conceptual introduction of Quality 4.0 has instigated a paradigm shift, with 
traditional approaches making way for the integration of Enterprise Quality Management Software (EQMS). This 
shift is particularly evident in sectors with stringent quality management systems, notably in industries like aerospace 
and defense, where adherence to the AS9100 standard is crucial. 
 
AS9100, as an extension of the ISO 9001 framework, introduces additional requirements covering configuration 
management, risk management, product safety, and prevention of counterfeit parts. The complexity of AS9100 
necessitates thorough documentation and process management, emphasizing a nuanced focus on risk management, 
continuous risk assessment in dynamic sectors, and the critical importance of supply chain management. The standard 
underscores the necessity for meticulous supplier selection, evaluation, and collaboration, placing a strong emphasis 
on product and service safety, especially in sectors where reliability is paramount. The meticulous documentation and 
continuous monitoring intrinsic to AS9100 highlight the multifaceted challenges it poses for organizations, embodying 
an industry-specific, process-oriented, risk-focused, and supply chain-centric nature. 
 
Despite the growing adoption of EQMS among AS9100-certified firms, the limitations of off-the-shelf EQMS 
products in achieving seamless compatibility with AS9100 standards hinder the attainment of optimal performance. 
Consequently, there is a noticeable trend where organizations are increasingly turning to the development of 
customized software solutions. This shift from off-the-shelf EQMS products is driven by the need for alignment with 
the intricacies of the organization's production processes, structural nuances, and overarching priorities.This study 
centers on the development of a tailored EQMS for a company operating in the defense industry. The company, 
classified as a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) with approximately 200 employees, specializes in offering 
composite ceramic products in the defense and aerospace sectors. Possessing certifications for ISO 9001, ISO 18001, 
ISO 14001, and AS 9100 quality management systems, the company currently employs ERP and MES systems. 
 
The research is situated in the context where the quality management module in the ERP system falls short of fully 
meeting the requirements of AS9100. In response to this inadequacy, the company has undertaken the development 
of a customized Enterprise Quality Management System (EQMS). The developed EQMS comprises modules such as

Abstract 
There is a significant increase in solid waste in the city of Bisha, mainly attributed to the rapid population growth 
characterizing the southern city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To address the challenge, a smart waste management 
system based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is proposed. The assessment of spatial distribution of waste 
bins in Bisha, where inefficient waste bin placement had been impacting waste management efficiency was prioritized. 
A comprehensive analysis of waste bin distribution across the city's neighborhoods, illustrated regions characterized 
by high population densities and concentrated waste bins placement. Through the application of diverse spatial 
analysis techniques, it was discovered that there was the clustering of waste bins in specific locations, accompanied 
by dispersion variations at various distances. The project's found the necessity for improved waste bin placement 
strategies to enhance waste management efficiency in the city of Bisha. The research offers insights into the spatial 
patterns of waste bins distribution and presents a data-driven approach to optimize waste collection processes. The 
approach aligns with the vision of a cleaner and more sustainable environment advocated by international 
organizations, such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). By implementing a GIS-based smart 
waste management system, Bisha can better manage its solid waste in a rapidly evolving urban landscape, reducing 
environmental impacts and public health risks, and contributing to global sustainability efforts.

to the concentration of waste bins in specific locations, previously mentioned, with a very high level of confidence as 
a result of the actual “K function” curve being far from the curve of the upper limits of confidence. The K-Function 
can be described by the following equation:

Where 𝑛𝑛 represetns the total number of features, 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 is the area of study and 𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the wieght. 
 
4.3 Moran I Analysis 
It is known as autocorrelation or spatial correlation analysis, and it determines the pattern of spread of a phenomenon 
spatially by studying the symmetry in the distribution of the phenomenon’s components spatially, and the extent of 
autocorrelation between them. It differs from nearest neighbor analysis in that it depends on entering another value 
that is taken as a criterion in calculating the spatial correlation, such as the number of populations, Moran's index 
values range between (-1, + 1). If the value is close to (-1), it means a dispersed or divergent distribution, while if it is 
close to (+1), it means a clustered or convergent distribution. Finally, if the value is close to Zero means that the 
distribution is random.  
 
According to the results of applying Moran’s guide (Figure 4-C), the distribution of waste bins in the city of Bisha 
takes a clustered pattern, as its value reached (+ 0.56). This was confirmed by the Z Score value of (11.40), as it falls 
outside the Critical Value range. (-2.58, + 2.58), with a confidence level of 99%, hence the number of waste bins 
increases in places with high population density. 
 
z = X − 𝜇𝜇
𝜎𝜎
 
The 𝑋𝑋 represents the data value, while 𝜇𝜇, 𝜎𝜎  represents mean and standard deviation respectively.  
The Moran’s I spatial correlation can be computed as follows:

Where 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 is used to represent the deviation of a given attribute for a particular feature from its mean, and 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 is the 
spatial weight between two features 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑗𝑗 from total features 𝑛𝑛. We can represent the aggregate weight 𝑊𝑊0 by

The formula for finding 𝑍𝑍𝐼𝐼 score can be described by the following equations.

(𝑛𝑛−1) 
𝑉𝑉(𝐼𝐼) = 𝐸𝐸[𝐼𝐼2] −𝐸𝐸[𝐼𝐼]2 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the current spatial distribution of waste bins in the city of Bisha is suboptimal and tends to cluster in 
areas with higher population density. Geographical distributions revealed that the waste bins were not evenly 
distributed throughout the city. Standard distance analysis indicated that a significant portion of the bins were located 
within a relatively small area, highlighting the need for a more balanced distribution. Directional distribution analysis 
showed that the distribution pattern of waste bins in the city had an oval shape, with the major axis extending from 
the northeast to the southwest, influenced by the city's flat topography. To achieve more efficient and sustainable 
waste management, it is essential to develop strategies that result in a more even distribution of waste bins across the 
city. The proposed smart waste management system based on GIS analysis provides a valuable tool for city planners 
and waste management authorities to optimize waste bins placement and collection routes, ultimately contributing to

a cleaner and more environmentally friendly Bisha. The research aimed to develop a smart waste management system 
based on GIS analysis to assess the spatial distribution of waste bins in Bisha. By implementing the recommended 
changes in waste bins distribution and collection routes, Bisha can take a step closer to achieving its waste management 
goals and aligning with international efforts to create a cleaner and more sustainable environment.  
 
The GIS-based smart waste management system in the City of Bisha, Saudi Arabia, effectively assesses the spatial 
distribution of waste bins. Results indicate optimized placement for efficient waste collection, minimizing 
environmental impact. Discussion should delve into the system's benefits, challenges, and potential improvements to 
enhance urban sustainability. The system likely contributes to improved waste collection logistics, reduced operational 
costs, and enhanced overall cleanliness. Discussion should explore any observed variations in waste generation 
patterns across different city zones and propose strategies for dynamic bin allocation based on real-time data. 
Additionally, community engagement and technology scalability could be key points for discussion to ensure the long-
term success of the GIS-based smart waste management initiative. Moreover, the study may discuss the integration of 
sensor technology for real-time fill level monitoring in waste bins, addressing issues such as overflow prevention and 
timely collections. Evaluating the economic viability and social acceptance of the system could provide insights into 
its sustainability and widespread adoption. Furthermore, comparisons with traditional waste management methods 
could highlight the tangible advantages of the GIS-based approach in terms of resource efficiency and environmental 
impact

Abstract 
The rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, notably from idling vehicles while waiting at traffic lights, have 
evolved into a pressing global issue that requires urgent attention. This comprehensive research delves into the 
relationship between the distribution of traffic signals and the emission of carbon in Bisha, Saudi Arabia. . This study 
investigates the correlation between traffic signal distribution and carbon emissions in Bisha, Saudi Arabia. Data was 
collected through fieldwork, GPS tracking, and emissions measurements. The research reveals that the city's traffic 
signals are concentrated on main road axes, contributing to increased traffic congestion and emissions. Private cars 
dominate the vehicle types, followed by taxis and heavy goods transport. The findings show a significant connection 
between the city's traffic signal placement and the surge in carbon emissions, particularly in the context of Bisha. The 
research brings to light that a significant concentration of traffic signals is found along the city's primary roads, 
worsening traffic congestion and contributing to a substantial increase in carbon emissions. Furthermore, the 
investigation argues that the leading vehicle category in Bisha consists of private cars, followed closely by taxis and 
heavy goods transport vehicles. These findings provide a valuable perspective on the environmental and societal 
consequences of this critical issue.

which are about 800 km away. This may explain the preference for using heavy goods transport vehicles over long 
distances to reduce the material costs of transported goods, or due to the large size and abundance of goods. 
Light goods transport vehicles came in last place, and this is explained by the proximity of the main traffic lights to 
the old neighborhoods of the city, where markets are concentrated near it, especially vegetables and fruits, which are 
brought daily. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study conducted in Bisha, Saudi Arabia, shows the significant challenges stemming from the increasing carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with idling vehicles at traffic lights. Bisha, serving as a sample of broader urban 
trends, struggles with rising traffic congestion and emissions driven by rapid urbanization and population growth. 
These research findings emphasize the urgent need for implementing sustainable strategies to mitigate the 
environmental and societal impacts of this issue. The implications of this research extend beyond Bisha, becoming a 
global concern. Addressing CO2 emissions resulting from idling vehicles has become a moral and environmental 
obligation with immense consequences for public health, air quality, and the fight against climate change. The study 
illustrates the need for collaborative efforts to combat climate change and align with the Sustainable Development 
Goals. As Bisha's urbanization continues rapidly, the challenge of reducing CO2 emissions remains pressing. The 
findings of this study inform policy and urban planning, not only in Bisha but also in other urban areas facing similar 
challenges. Embracing sustainable urban planning, improving traffic management, and promoting eco-friendly 
transportation options are critical steps in mitigating the environmental impact of idling vehicles at traffic lights. 
Taking action now is essential to protect the environment and ensure the well-being of current and future generations.

Abstract 
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a 3D printing process that builds parts layer by layer by selectively depositing 
melted material in a predetermined path.  FDM has gained popularity due to its low cost, ease of use, and wide material 
availability. However, there are still challenges to overcome, especially when it comes to producing small-scale 
features with high precision and quality. Small-scale features are essential in many applications such as microfluidics, 
microelectronics, and biomedical devices. The ability to produce high-quality small-scale features with FDM can 
significantly expand its potential applications. This paper aims to assess the manufacturability of small holes using 
3D printing-FDM Technology. Benchmarking specimens contained holes with varied sizes are designed and 
fabricated with different parameters (layer height and building direction). The results of this study provided an insights 
into the limitations and capabilities of FDM technology for small-scale holes fabrication and help to identify potential 
areas for improvement.

1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has revolutionized the way we produce objects, enabling the 
fabrication of complex geometries with ease and precision. Among the various 3D printing technologies available, 
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) has gained significant popularity due to its low cost, user-friendly nature, and 
wide range of compatible materials (Rajan, Kumaresan, et al,2022). FDM works by selectively depositing melted 
material layer by layer to build a part according to a predetermined path. FDM also known as Fused Filament 
Fabrication (FFF). The FDM process begins with a 3D model of the desired object, which is sliced into thin layers by 
specialized software. The 3D printer then heats a filament of thermoplastic material, typically ABS (Acrylonitrile 
Butadiene Styrene) or PLA (Polylactic Acid), to its melting point. The melted material is extruded through a nozzle 
and deposited onto the build platform or previous layers, following the pre-determined path specified by the sliced 
model. As the deposited material cools down, it solidifies and adheres to the previous layers, gradually building up 
the object. The printer moves the nozzle along the X, Y, and Z axes to create the desired shape. Support structures 
may be added during printing to provide stability for overhanging or complex features, and these supports can be 
removed after the printing process is complete. The ability to manufacture small-scale holes using FDM technology 
is an area of interest and research. Understanding the manufacturability and quality of small holes is crucial for 
expanding the applications of FDM and improving its capabilities. This exploration involves assessing the effects of 
different parameters, such as layer height and building direction, on the fabrication of small holes using FDM.

The microscopy images confirm the printed holes in vertical direction have better roundness compared with those 
fabricated in horizontal direction. Also it’s clear that the roundness are improved as the hole dimeters are increased.                               
 
5. Conclusion 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the manufacturability and the quality of small holes via FDM 3D printing 
technology with different layer heights and building directions. The following conclusions are drawn based on 
the results: 
• 
The minimum printable hole in the horizontal direction is 0.3 diameter mm and 0.8mm in vertical 
detraction. 
• 
The minimum printable diameter pin is 0.9mm and any diameter less than 0.9mm didn’t appear in the 
fabricated part. 
• 
The printing direction has a significant effect on the hole manufacturability and quality and the vertical build 
direction perform well better than the horizontal build direction. 
More studies can be conducted in the effect of printer parameter on the process capability on fabrication the 
other small features and. Also different materials can be used and the rules can be developed for each materials.

Abstract 
Extending the work of Downing & Badar (2022), this paper presents the history of software, artificial intelligence, 
software quality assurance, and a software QA architecture called the Quality Assurance Machine (QAM). Using 
Design Science Research (DSR), the QAM was extended to support software containing ML models. Using 
descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing, this paper answers the research question: is QAM effective for assuring 
the quality of software containing ML? Future DSR efforts will add a Process Quality engine to the QAM to monitor 
and improve the processes used to create software and models.

1. Introduction
Downing & Badar (2022) in their paper on holistic QA wrote: “The software industry is in transition: The traditional 
space, software 1.0, has seen more than fifty years of creation, testing, and delivery of deterministic software, but this 
tradition is being disrupted by the stochastic model of software 2.0.” The paper (Downing & Badar, 2022), published 
in the summer of 2022, examined the possibility of using traditional quality assurance methodologies (software 1.0) 
for machine learning applications (software 2.0), and on November 30th of that year the OpenAI large language model, 
ChatGPT, was released to the public. Reaching 100 million monthly users two months after launch, it became the 
fastest-growing consumer application in history (Hu & Hu, 2023). Disrupted speaks to impact of a change, and it 
remains true that AI is having an impact on the software industry and industries that rely on software. There are 
businesses seeing no or low impact due to AI, examples being those related to human touch and interpersonal 
interaction (Ezell, 2019), requiring ethical decision-making (Mittelstadt et al., 2016), or necessitating emotional depth 
and empathy (Turkle, 2017). According to an IBM study, 68% of businesses in the United States plan to invest in AI 
by 2025; the non-AI businesses are either already, or soon to be in the minority.  
Given the nature of the change AI is creating, perhaps disruption is too insufficient a label. Khun (1962) describes 
science as a process involving occasional revolutions followed by periods of normality where the details of a new 
paradigm are fleshed out, and Dhar (2003) notes a paradigm is a set of theories and methods accepted by the 
community. Over the course of its more than fifty-year history (Kneuper, 2017) software has seen advancements in

The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that the two proportions are the same: 
Ha: RTSW / DDSW = RTML / DDML => 83/157 = 26/56 
 
For the two-sample z-test for proportions,  
n1 = 157, x1 = 83 => 𝑝𝑝̂1 = 
83
157 =  0.529 
 
n2 = 56, x2 = 26 => 𝑝𝑝̂2 = 
26
56 =  0.464 
 
Pooled proportion 𝑝𝑝̂ = 
83 + 26
157 + 56 =  0.512 
 
𝑧𝑧= 
0.529 − 0.464
√(0.512)(1 −0.512)( 1
157 + 1
56)
 =  0.835 
 
For a z score = 0.835 the p-value = 0.403, which is above the significance level set for this test. Therefore, the null is 
rejected and the alternative accepted. The two proportions are the same, and using the QAM for ML product quality 
is effective. 
 
4.2.2 The Qualified Yes 
This paper answers the product quality portion of the research question: Can quality assurance be performed 
effectively for ML solutions using the same process as that for software? Descriptive and inferential statistics have 
shown the answer to be yes, however, ML models have probabilistic outcomes whereas software is deterministic. The 
model pipeline, one of data engineering, model tuning, and accuracy verification, is very different from the SDLC, 
and at many points skill sets that are not software engineering are necessary to design, develop, test, and release an 
ML model into production. For example, in the medical space clinical expertise is required to verify model outcomes 
are clinically correct. This is not an SQA activity. Ultimately it becomes a question, perhaps another research question, 
of strategy. Is there more value derived by creating two teams using different processes and tools to perform QA of a 
mixed technology product? This paper does not attempt to answer that question, but it does prove that traditional SQA 
is effective for software containing ML models. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The first author of this paper has worked in the software industry for decades, and until two years ago knew as much 
about AI as was advertised in mass media. Even for a software professional, what AI was, the impact it was having, 
the impact it would have, was unknown. Twenty years ago, the Google search engine was like magic, and today it is 
slightly annoying, users having to piece together bits of information from multiple sites while negotiating more adds 
than relevant content. Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT and Bard are similar to the Google magic of the 
past. Incredibly efficient and strangely effective, they are merely an example of where technology, not just the software 
industry, but technology, is heading. They have issues, and taking an LLM response as truth is risky business. That 
will change, and the change will likely be faster than anticipated. The software industry and the businesses that use 
software are experiencing a rapid paradigm shift, perhaps too rapid for the companies creating AI. The quality 
processes and teams needed to support the transition to AI are immature at best, ad hoc most likely. The literature 
does not support it, but from a quality perspective a possible bridge between the age of software and AI-enabled 
software is to lean into tradition. SQA solutions like the QAM are effective for assuring product quality in software 
containing probabilistic models, and follow-on research will attempt to prove they are also effective for improving the 
quality of the processes that create it.          
 
This research did not directly address two concerns with products containing ML models, those being model 
maintenance post-production release, and approaches to shifting model testing left, that is, closer to the model 
development phase. ML models are trained on a labeled set of data, but it is not the entire population of data; it is a 
sample. In a production environment models process new data, and that data may change over time compared to the 
static training data. Financial data, weather data, population data, these are examples of changes in a data set. A 
model’s response to this changing data can cause its accuracy to degrade, and this is known as model drift (Gama et 
al., 2014). Addressing model drift from a quality perspective is an opportunity for further research. Shifting the QA

activity left, closer to model development, is a planned activity and already part of the QAM’s design. In the QAM, 
all models can be tested outside of the software where they run in production. The future challenge is to create the 
infrastructure necessary to build and deliver models outside of the normal ML pipeline.

Abstract 
The importance of supply chain management has been progressively rising in competitive business. Companies must 
embrace a suitable supply chain management strategy to compete effectively within the supply chain domain. 
Companies harness their efforts and capabilities to meet their customers' demands. In addressing these demands, they 
encounter ongoing market fluctuations. Consequently, due to the company's desire to fulfill their customer's needs, 
the competition has shifted from among companies to competition between the supply chains within these companies. 
The complexity of the petroleum industry's supply chain surpasses that of many other sectors. The intricate nature of 
petrochemical supply chain management originates from the crucial need to maintain uninterrupted plant operations 
and facilitate the transport of final products. Tasnee (National Industrialization Company) is a prominent Saudi 
Arabian diversified industrial company operating in various sectors, including petrochemicals, chemicals, plastics, 
metals, and other industrial businesses. The company has a significant presence in the global market. This paper seeks 
to understand Tasnee's supply chain approach for polymer products, contrasting the lean/efficient supply chain 
strategy with the agile/responsive supply chain strategy. A comprehensive literature review gathered insights from 
pertinent studies and relevant publications. In addition to the literature survey, semi-structured one-to-one interviews 
were conducted with various managerial levels in supply chain management at Tasnee to acquire further insights into 
the supply chain strategies. Based on the collected information, it is evident that Tasnee predominantly adheres to a 
Lean supply chain strategy for Polymer products, except for applying a Leagile supply chain strategy in managing 
profit margins. Overall, Tasnee aligns with an efficient supply chain model.

1. Introduction
Companies harness their efforts and capabilities to meet their customers' continuous and changing demands. In 
addressing these demands, they encounter ongoing market fluctuations. Consequently, due to the company's desire to 
fulfill their customer's demands, the competition has shifted from among companies to competition between the supply 
chains within these companies. A supply chain strategy encompasses a company's enduring blueprint to steer it 
efficiently.  
Supply chain term refers to the interconnected system of activities, individuals, and enterprises involved in the 
production and distribution of goods, spanning from the acquisition of raw materials to the final delivery of finished 
products to customers (Agi et al. 2022), (Akhavan et al. 2022). 
Gansler et al. (2004) define SCM as ensuring everything - like materials, money, and information - is handled and 
organized correctly as things move from getting raw materials to giving the final product to the person who will use

Regarding supply chain management, a purchasing policy defines the procurement process's guidelines and principles, 
ensuring alignment with the organization's objectives and values. Tasnee, a significant supplier of polymer, follows 
its procurement process in sync with its corporate objectives. 
 
The interviews underscored that polymer products are typically considered commodity products due to their widely 
available components and recipes in the market. A comprehensive understanding of algorithmic and consultative 
forecasting is crucial to effectively selling polymer products. Algorithmic forecasting utilizes data-driven models to 
predict market trends, while consultative forecasting incorporates insights from experts and customers. By combining 
both approaches, Tasnee can better identify optimal market opportunities. 
 
Lead-time compression was recognized as vital in the polymer product industry. This involves reducing the time to 
fulfill customer orders, enhancing customer satisfaction and a competitive edge. Efficient production processes, 
streamlined supply chains, and effective inventory management are crucial for achieving lead-time compression. 
The rapid reconfiguration of the supply chain is desirable, particularly in the polymer product industry. Tasnee's ability 
to swiftly adapt to market changes, introduce new products, and optimize operations is crucial. Tasnee emphasizes 
collaboration with partners, suppliers, and stakeholders in its supply chain operations. This approach helps address 
issues promptly, share information, and collectively reconfigure strategies and operations to ensure resilience and 
adaptability. Tasnee strategically builds its supply chain to ensure resilience and agility, enabling it to navigate 
challenges and changes without significant disruptions to its operations. This adaptable methodology is crucial for 
maintaining efficient operations and reducing disruptions in the movement of goods and services.

Abstract 
Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) has been one of the most valuable strategies that provides a number of benefits for 
both suppliers and customers. There was an impact on the proposed improvement practices listed, including VMI that 
enhanced and smoothened spare parts supply chain management. For suppliers, it can help to improve customer 
satisfaction by ensuring that they always have the products they need in stock. It can also help to reduce inventory 
costs by eliminating the need for the supplier to carry excess inventory. For customers, VMI can help to free up 
resources that can be focused on other areas of the business, such as sales and marketing. It can also help to improve 
inventory visibility and accuracy, and reduce the risk of stockouts. In this study, the services provided at residential 
complexes of the case study in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia have been listed, and then have found the most critical services 
to the tenants by conducting a scoring questionnaire. These services have been analyzed and listed the most common 
issues and have went through their supply chain process to rate the supply chain interruption risk. The highest rated 
risk service has been picked up as an example to apply the forecasting methodology. The historical data has been used 
for the elevators main board to draw the curve of occurrences probability. The curve equation has been found in order 
to use it as a forecasting tool. The finding shows the upcoming year expected demand using the mathematical 
calculations. 
Keywords 
Supply chain, Vendor managed inventory (VMI), Maintenance, and Facility management. 
1. Introduction
Effective supply chain management plays an important role to ensure the continuity of the services provided in 
residential complexes, and therefore stopping them or operating inappropriately will directly affect the satisfaction of 
the residents and affect the reputation and thus the commercial value and profits. Accurate demand forecasting can 
help facility managers to reduce costs by avoiding the need to order and stock unnecessary parts, improve efficiency 
by ensuring that the right parts are available when they need them, reduce downtime and disruptions to services and 
improve resident satisfaction. (Karthika, 2020).  
This study is significant because it will provide facility managers with a better understanding of how to forecast 
demand for spare parts for critical services in residential facilities (Nazali, 2009) and how to implement VMI. VMI is 
a collaborative approach to supply chain management that can lead to improved supplier-customer relationships 
(Marquès, 2010). This can lead to better communication and cooperation, which can benefit both parties. Overall, the 
data in this study has been collected from 5 residential complexes by performing visits to the assigned property 
managers and through questionnaires spread to 40 tenants.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Vendor managed inventory (VMI) control safety stock of the buyer, so that vertical integration, and responsiveness 
are maintained to leverage customer service and improve the supply chain process. VMI transfers the risk and cost of 
storing and controlling parts to the vendor. This can free up resources for the company and improve efficiency. Safety 
stock is a buffer of inventory that can be used to cover unexpected demand. This can help to prevent stockouts and 
meet customer needs through replenishment to cover demand variations. For this case study, it was successful having 
VMI for the information to be transferred between company parties. This reduced reaction time and outsource 
maintenance costs. The benefit gained also was responding to customer demand and changes in the market. By 
implementing these improvements, the company has improved its supply chain efficiency, reduced costs, and met 
customers’ needs more effectively. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Effective supply chain management plays a very important role to ensure the continuity of the services provided in 
residential complexes, and therefore stopping them or operating inappropriately will directly affect the satisfaction of 
the residents and affect the reputation and thus the commercial value and profits. 
Accurate demand forecasting and proper VMI helped facility managers to: 
• 
Reduce costs by avoiding the need to order and stock unnecessary parts. 
• 
Avoid holding cost and inventory risk and transfer it to the supplier. 
• 
Improve efficiency by ensuring that the right parts are available when they need them. 
• 
Reduce downtime and disruptions to services. 
• 
Improve resident satisfaction.

Abstract 
According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, 99.1% of 
elementary schools in Japan provide school lunches. Nutrition teachers prepare school lunch menus at monthly 
meetings. Because nutrition teachers need to consider a large number and variety of constraints, it requires a lot of 
time and effort to prepare menus. Therefore, it is highly significant to introduce an automatic menu creation model 
for school lunches. In the school lunch standards, nutrition teachers are expected to expose students to various foods. 
From the viewpoint of dietary education, nutrition teachers are also required to expose students to a variety of 
ingredients and tastes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the dishes diversity in terms of ingredients and seasonings. 
For automatic school lunch menu creation, the similarities between dishes are important to provide an appropriate 
combination of various foods. There were previous studies that calculated dishes similarity considering ingredients 
and food groups and grouped similar dishes considering the main seasoning. In our previous study of automatic school 
lunch menu creation, the inter-dish similarities were calculated based on the categories and the gram amounts of 
ingredients and seasonings in each dish. Based on the inter-dish similarities, similar dishes were classified into the 
same group, and constraints on the frequency of serving were created for each similar dish group to create an automatic 
menu creation model. The issue of the previous study was that the grouping of similar dishes was based solely on the 
same ingredients and seasonings in the end. In other words, the results were not sufficiently based on human senses. 
For example, the main ingredients of two dishes are different for beef and pork, respectively, but are the same meat 
food group. In addition, if their seasoning combinations are very similar, humans may judge these two dishes as 
similar. Considering the food groups of main ingredients, the grouping is expected to become close to the human 
senses. The purpose of this study is to propose a calculation method of inter-dish similarity that considers the dishes 
similarities based on the food group of the main ingredients and combination of seasonings. In this study, the main 
ingredient in each dish was determined based on the number of ingredients in each dish and their gram amounts.

Abstract 
This study undertook a comprehensive analysis of the eco-efficiency and economic viability of various city buses, 
focusing on their environmental impact and life cycle costs. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental 
footprints of buses, considering their type and recycling country, were assessed. Results highlighted the generally 
lower environmental impacts of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses compared to diesel and electric buses. 
Furthermore, Life Cycle Cost (LCC) evaluations showed diesel buses as the least economical, with Chinese CNG 
buses emerging as the most cost-effective over their lifespan. Additional analysis using the PCA-DEA model indicated 
the superior efficiency of certain bus units, especially both the Chinese CNG recycled in China and India. Sensitivity 
analysis further revealed that environmental categories with higher sensitivity ratios can achieve complete efficiency 
with modest improvements. Overall, the findings suggest that CNG buses, particularly those from China, present an 
eco-friendly and economically sustainable choice for urban transportation.

Abstract 
In this study, we explore how firms determine production and remanufacturing strategies considering knowledge 
spillover, which is unavoidable in nowadays remanufacturing systems in practice. The remanufacturing system 
considered in this study consists of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a third-party remanufacturer 
(TPR). The OEM produces and sells an innovative product for which the innovation-knowledge cannot be directly 
observed by the TPR. Thanks to the spillover of OEM’s general knowledge about product design and production his 
remanufacturing processes, the TPR not only remanufactures used products but also produces new products under his 
own brand. He sells remanufactured and new products in the same market as the OEM. In response to the potential 
market share cannibalization from TPR’s products, the OEM collaborates with the TPR by granting the latter a 
remanufacturing authorization. The spillover of OEM’s innovation knowledge takes place under this cooperation. In 
examining the effect of general and innovation knowledge spillover on two firms’ production and cooperation 
strategies, we consider two scenarios in this study, including i) pure competition and ii) remanufacturing authorization 
cooperation. We develop and analyze several game theoretical models. Our results highlight the conditions under 
which the TPR engages in new product production without remanufacturing in pure competition and cooperation 
scenarios. An interesting finding is that although innovation-knowledge spillover motivates the TPR to engage in new 
product production and weakens the competitiveness of OEM’s products, both firms can be better off when compared 
to the pure competition scenario. Moreover, both consumer surplus and environment can be improved by 
remanufacturing authorization cooperation.

Abstract 
The article attempts to understand the impostor phenomenon in the innovation ecosystem, where high-achieving 
individuals, despite their accomplishments, experience a sense of intellectual phoniness. They constantly fear being 
unmasked as frauds and struggle to acknowledge their own success. A systematic literature review is conducted to 
explore the antecedents and consequences of the phenomenon in entrepreneurs. Research on the impostor phenomenon 
is extensive and provides valuable insights regarding the impostor phenomenon in various professions and age groups. 
However, the impostor phenomenon within the innovation ecosystem is stint that hampers our ability to confidently 
derive clear conclusions in both research and practice domains with respect to the entrepreneurs who are the actors of 
the innovation ecosystem. There is also a lack of research on mediating and moderating variables in the relation 
between the impostor phenomenon and entrepreneurial performance. As a result, numerous fundamental questions 
remain unanswered, like why entrepreneurs believe they don’t belong in the entrepreneurial sphere. The innovation 
ecosystem provides an interesting context, with human capital, social capital, and financial capital as its elements. 
These factors set the context for the causes of the impostor phenomenon in entrepreneurs. The article suggests 
pertinent mediators and moderators that may enrich the understanding of the Impostor phenomenon. The nature of the 
impostor phenomenon, innovation ecosystem and entrepreneurs provide a conceptual framework to understand the 
impostor phenomenon in entrepreneurs. The proposed framework is discussed, and relevant propositions are provided. 
The possibilities for future research are also highlighted.

Abstract 
This paper examines the barriers to the adoption of Intelligent Agriculture (IA) in sub-Saharan Africa in response to 
the global challenge of food insecurity. IA offers a long lasting solution to enhance agricultural productivity and food 
security globally. However, its adoption faces significant obstacles. This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying 
and offering practical and theoretical solutions to these barriers. This study adopted a quantitative method using a 
questionnaire. The research identifies 13 barriers to IA adoption in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), encompassing issues 
related to financial constraints, credit access, data accessibility and operability, cyber-attacks, communication, Internet 
access, technical expertise, planning, policy, requirements, cultural factors, and infrastructure. Using exploratory 
factor analysis (EFA), these barriers are categorized into four distinct dimensions: financial and resource constraints, 
policy and cultural challenges, communication, planning, and cybersecurity issues, and technological and regulatory 
barriers. These dimensions underscore the multifaceted nature of the challenges in IA adoption. However, a rank-
order analysis was used to analyse the data that is related to the suggested solutions to the barriers to adoption of IA 
in SSA. The result showed that the participant most prioritised solution is financial support. This study is limited by 
the sample size as the dimensions extracted can be improved beyond 4. Moreover, the method of extraction can be 
also improved. Policy-related obstacles can hinder the alignment of IA with Sustainable Development Goals and 
regional commitments, making a comprehensive approach essential. Participants prioritize financial support, 
education, and collaboration among stakeholders as top solutions to these barriers.

1 Introduction 
Throughout human history, agriculture has played a pivotal role in our survival and development. However, it faces a 
pressing global challenge: food security (Abbasi et al 2022). This issue has intensified due to various human-driven 
factors like rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, land loss, water scarcity, and environmental 
degradation. Projections suggest that between 9.4 and 10.1 billion people will inhabit the Earth by 2050, underscoring

Abstract 
The objective of this research was to reduce the risks associated with the maintenance operations of high-voltage 
transmission lines, which covers Preventive maintenance (PM), Corrective maintenance (CM), and enhancement of 
transmission system equipment (Improvement maintenance; IM). Considering that the task involves numerous steps 
and requires teamwork of approximately 8-12 individuals per operation, any errors in execution could result in injuries, 
fatalities, or repercussions on the electricity supply, potentially causing widespread power outages. The study was 
conducted with an emphasis on risk management and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) based on the PEME (People-
Equipment-Material-Environment) principle. Then, tasks with medium to high-level risks were further assessed using 
the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to identify preventive measures or risk control methods, ensuring that 
the risks were either prevented or kept within the organization's acceptable range. The results from this research 
provided insights into risk management practices for high-risk tasks based on risk assessments, facilitating the 
reduction of losses in human resources, assets, and the electricity production process. This, in turn, reduces the chance 
of missed opportunities in power distribution within the operational unit. It was also found that a work with a high 
severity value has a small chance of being conceived. Risk can be decreased to an acceptable level for 19 jobs within 
the organization. In this regard, there are 7 new procedure manuals and improved operating procedures.

1. Introduction
High-voltage power line maintenance refers to the care and upkeep of power transmission lines, electric distribution 
lines, substations, or other equipment essential for electricity transmission or distribution. This ensures that the 
transmission system remains reliable and trustworthy, meeting the needs of customers and maximizing their 
satisfaction. The high-voltage power lines of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) are akin to the 
major arteries of the Thai electrical system, necessitating consistent maintenance to ensure stability and readiness to 
provide electricity to all areas of Thailand. A single point of failure or damage can result in widespread power outages. 
The voltage levels of these high-voltage transmission lines include 69, 115, 230, 300 (HVDC), and 500 kilovolts. 
Dedicated units are responsible for maintaining the transmission system, ensuring its constant operability. High-
voltage power line maintenance tasks, such as Preventive Maintenance (PM), Corrective Maintenance (CM), and 
Improvement Maintenance (IM), aim to maintain the system's reliability and trustworthiness, maximizing customer 
satisfaction. Maintenance activities might be conducted while high-voltage electricity is being supplied (Hotline) or 
after the power has been turned off (Deadline). Regardless of the approach, every operation poses risks at every 
moment, which can lead to potential losses for the organization. The electrical insulators have been changed, as 
illustrated in Figure 1. (Alexander et al. 2023) While the High Voltage Transmission Line Maintenance Unit crew is

3. Work analysis should involve experienced individuals from various levels of management, department heads, and 
operational staff. Their participation in the analysis process will help the organization manage risks more effectively. 
4. To ensure that risk management aligns with risk control measures, management should push for practical 
implementation. Incentives and mechanisms for change and practical application should be in place. 
• 
Management issues a policy requiring employees to adhere to risk control measures and announces it widely. 
• 
Employees who violate or fail to comply with risk control measures, and whose actions result in damage to the 
organization's property due to deliberate misconduct, are required to compensate for the damage based on the 
criteria established by the organization. 
• 
If employees' compliance with risk control measures leads to the absence of losses within the organization, 
management should consider this as a contributing factor in evaluating their performance, rewards, or 
commendations. 
5. Guidelines for Transmitting Risk Control Measures to Operational Level Workers should be implemented as 
follows: 
• 
Conduct training for maintenance and operation personnel to make them aware of job-specific rules and 
regulations as per the risk control measures. 
• 
Develop step-by-step work procedures and instructions with moderate risk for all personnel. 
• 
Before starting any task with moderate risk, the supervisor should conduct on-the-job training each time to review 
the work procedures, and all personnel must sign that they understand these procedures. 
• 
Implement an observation system to assist in performing tasks with the involvement of experienced observers 
appointed by management to identify improvement areas and find ways to enhance strengths.

A Cost-Effective Approach for Inventory- Transportation to 
Address Carbon Tax Policy

Abstract 
The growing concern regarding global warming has resulted in the implementation of regulations aimed at 
progressively diminishing the volume of greenhouse gases released by industrial sectors and their associated supply 
chains. This research study concentrates on quantifying the carbon emissions within a two-tiered supply chain, in 
which a single supplier distributes a single product to different retailers, while also coordinating the many elements 
of the chain including transportation and inventory. A mixed integer programming (MIP) approach has been developed 
to attain this goal. This model considers decisions such as the time and quantity of replenishment for each retailer, the 
types of transportation vehicles employed, and the number of products transported by each vehicle. The goal of this 
optimization model is not only a reduction in transportation expenses and inventory management costs but also carbon 
emissions across the supply chain which can be reduced by regarding tax as a leverage.

1. Introduction
Supply chain has attracted significant attention in academia and industry. The primary focus lies on the carbon 
emissions stemming from supply chain operations, prompting numerous governments to enforce carbon taxes as a 
means to encourage emission reduction and energy preservation. Against this failure, the effects of carbon taxes on 
the supply chain and its associated operational choices have become highly debated subjects. 
*-+The supply chain is a network of interconnected business activities designed to maximise customer satisfaction. 
The first step in this process is the extraction of raw materials, which is followed by the fabrication of items and their 
subsequent delivery to the client. To produce a service or good that customers are prepared to pay for, all links in the 
supply chain must work together, but this is what happens when the network is efficient. A number of elements 
collaborate (sometimes independently of the other elements) to function as an expanded organisation and make 
optimal use of company resources (human resources, processes, and technology) in order to provide the highest 
quality, most cost-effective, and most timely delivery of the product to the ultimate customers (Deshpande and 
Swaminathan, 2020). 
The term ""green supply chain management"" refers to the process of incorporating environmental considerations into 
every step of the supply chain, from product selection to manufacturer and material selection to production methods 
to packaging to delivery methods (Mardani et al., 2020). 
Environmental issues, along with other economic variables, have been incorporated into supply chain modelling in 
recent years (Frommer and Day, 2017). (Bray, Serpa and Colak, 2019) stated that the environmental compatibility of 
the various phases of the supply chain may result in more competitive trade and operational performance. Green

The objective function of the model comprises of four distinct parts. The first component represents the total costs 
associated with vehicles (including driver salaries, fuel expenses, and maintenance costs), while the second component 
denotes the total cost incurred in transporting products between retailers. The third component reflects the total 
inventory maintenance costs, and the fourth section displays the total costs attributed to carbon emissions. Constraint 
(2) is for determining the inventory balance for each retailer. This guarantees that the remaining stock of a retailer for 
the upcoming period is equivalent to the sum of products received, their remaining inventory from the previous period, 
minus the current demand for each individual product. Constraints (3) and (4) ensure that the carrying capacity of a 
vehicle does not exceed its loading capacity within a specific time period. Equations (5) through (7) define variables 
utilized in the objective function to measure the costs for carbon emission. Constraints (8,9) denote non-negative and 
binary variables, respectively. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this article, we delved into the intricacies of transportation and inventory planning within a 2-layer, multi-product, 
multi-time network, with a specific emphasis on mitigating carbon emissions. Specifically, we consider the definite 
and dynamic demand of retailers and the decision-making responsibility of the supplier regarding the quantity and 
timing of goods sent. This decision-making is facilitated by an inventory management system implemented by the 
seller. This model introduces several innovations, including taking into account different modes of transportation, 
utilizing different modes of transportation, accounting for fluctuating carbon emissions, and integrating the 
dimensions and mass of goods into the modeling process. To achieve this, we have developed a non-linear mixed 
integer programming model that has been linearized using linear methods. The objective of this study is to obtain 
precise solutions for small and medium-sized examples to demonstrate the practical application of our model under 
different scenarios.

Abstract 
The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) deals with assigning aircraft types to the scheduled flights based on fleet 
capabilities, aircraft availabilities, flight requirements, and operational costs. Due to high operating costs, the large 
number of flights scheduled each day, and the dependency of the following processes in the airline scheduling 
processes on FAP output, solving the FAP has always been a challenging task for the airlines. In this work, a revised 
integer linear programming model is proposed for solving the daily FAP. The model has an objective function of 
minimizing the operating cost of assigning a fleet type to a specific flight. In addition, the proposed model of the daily 
FAP aims to satisfy the following constraints: flight cover, aircraft type balance, fleet size, flight traffic (demand), 
flight flying altitude, and runway length requirements. The proposed model was successfully applied on a real-world 
dataset related to a national airline and solved using Gurobi software. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has been 
performed to show the effect of changing different FAP parameters on the obtained results.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Air transport is crucial to the economic growth and development of any country, it facilitates the integration of the 
global economy and provides vital connectivity both nationally and internationally. Airline scheduling is the backbone 
of any airline’s operation as it deals with everything related to flights, such as destinations, departure and arrival times, 
and working days. In addition, it includes assigning aircraft for each flight, along with developing cabin crew and 
maintenance schedules for each aircraft. The airline scheduling process provides a plan of the usage pattern of the 
airline’s aircraft and their resources, such as cabin crew and pilots, to meet the forecasted demand. The schedule 
planning is usually for one season only, which spans from six to nine months (Camilleri, 2018). 
More formally, the airline scheduling process helps in reaching the optimal situation that achieves the objectives of 
the airline, such as maximizing profits, minimizing costs, reducing the number of aircrafts used, and improving the 
performance of airlines. This process typically involves many complexities, including complex flight network, 
different aircraft types, limited number of gates, air traffic control restrictions, environmental regulations, stringent 
safety requirements, multiple crew work rules, complex payment structures, competitive dynamic environments in 
which passenger demands are uncertain, and complex pricing strategies (Bazargan, 2010).

(3) The required number of aircraft of some fleet types has changed due to changes in flights’ timings. For example, 
six aircrafts are now needed of the first fleet type. In addition, the number of nodes has changed too, they now 
became 17 nodes, instead of 20. 
The model results and the sensitivity analysis showed the applicability of the proposed model in solving the daily FAP 
under different situations. Studying different scenarios would help airlines in optimizing the total operating costs and 
determining the number of aircraft that should be available of each fleet type to cope with the changes in number of 
passengers and flights’ timings. Knowing the optimum assignment (and number) of aircraft required in different 
situations, airlines should be able to save money.

Conclusion 
The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) has a major effect on airline operating costs and satisfying passengers’ demand; 
therefore, optimizing FAP is crucial. FAP is the problem of assigning the right fleet type to each flight in the airline 
schedule. More specifically, it aims to assign as many flights as possible in the schedule to one or more fleet types, 
while optimizing an objective function and meeting various operational constraints. In FAP, airlines typically operate 
several different fleet types. Each fleet type has different characteristics and costs. In this paper, a mathematical model 
is developed to solve the daily FAP, where it is formulated as an integer linear programming model. The model’s 
objective function is to minimize the total operating costs. A set of constraints are included in the model, such as flight 
cover, aircraft type balance, fleet size, flight traffic (demand), flight flying altitude, and runway length requirements.  
The applicability of the proposed model has been demonstrated by a real-world dataset related to a national airline, 
which was solved using Gurobi optimization software. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to 
evaluate the effect of changes in problem parameters on the model results, where two scenarios were evaluated. In the 
first scenario, changing the number of passengers is assessed. While in the second scenario, flights’ timings of some 
flights have been changed, along with changing the number of passengers of some flights. In these scenarios, the total 
operating costs and the assigned fleet types for some flights have changed. The total operating cost increased by 36.6% 
in the first scenario and decreased by 39.1% in the second scenario. Also, the required number of aircraft of some fleet 
type has changed in the second scenario.  
 
As further work, the following is proposed. Taking the fleet maintenance time into consideration and, hence, not all 
aircraft would be available all the time. Furthermore, including more than one objective function such as minimizing 
the costs and maximizing the utilization of aircraft. Finally, utilizing a metaheuristic approach to solve the model in a 
suitable computational time, especially for large datasets.

Abstract 
Silicon wafers are the dominate materials in nowadays semiconductor industries. The most popular method to produce 
these wafers is known as Czochralski Process (Cz). For the first time, the cooling tube thermal shield is introduced in 
order to enhance the efficiency and productivity of Czochralski Process. In this new configuration the cold water flows 
to vicinity of crystal above the thermal shield. This increases the temperature gradient and subsequently increases the 
pulling speed. For this the three-dimensional energy equation, Navier stocks equation, moving mesh method and 
thermal stress model are fully coupled to determine wafer quality under the newly proposed thermal shield. 
Temperature distribution, melt and argon flow, crystal front shape and thermal stress are then obtained and 
investigated carefully. All results are compared between the original CZ process and the new version.  The results 
showed that the crystal growth rate can be enhanced by new configuration about 25%. Additionally, the maximum 
thermal stress increases from 10MPa to ~20 MPa where still is under the critical value 25MPa. The simulation proved 
that the new CZ process shows a great potential to enhance the efficiency of silicon wafer production to a new level.

Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Resilience of 
Interdependent Critical Infrastructures

Abstract 
Critical infrastructures, such as power and water networks, are vital for society and the economy. However, they are 
vulnerable to various disruptions such as component failures, cyber-attacks, and natural disasters. These disruptions 
can cascade across critical infrastructure networks (CINs), causing significant socioeconomic losses. Decision-makers 
face the challenge of protecting CINs before disruptions and restoring their functions afterward, considering 
interdependencies and uncertainties. Current methods struggle to model big data, complex interactions, and multilayer 
dependencies between CINs. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications can be used to 
overcome these challenges, as they can model complex systems and discover data patterns representing a promising 
research trend that could benefit both private companies and governments. This article undertakes a comprehensive 
review of the literature on the applications of machine learning in improving the resilience of interdependent critical 
infrastructure systems (ICISs). The aim is to address the existing knowledge gap and dispersed research articles in this 
area, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. The 
primary goal of this article is to assess the current state of ML applications in the ICISs resilience engineering field 
by examining the available literature, in order to discover future opportunities and trends. The findings are 
summarized, and potential future trends and opportunities are listed, aiming to inspire resilience engineering 
practitioners to explore these future directions in the field.

1. Introduction
Machine learning (ML) is a data-oriented field of computing that allows computers to process and learn from data 
without explicit programming (Alkhaleel, 2024). According to Murphy (2012), ML can be defined as a group of 
techniques capable of detecting data patterns and using discovered information to forecast unseen data and improve 
the decision-making process. ML techniques excel in identifying hidden patterns in data, as well as complex systems 
modeling (Alkhaleel, 2024). Therefore, ML applications have expanded to various domains such as healthcare, 
education, transportation, e-commerce, and resilience engineering is next in line, especially applications related to 
critical infrastructure systems (CISs). Maintaining resilient infrastructure is important but requires costly investments 
in advanced systems (e.g., smart grids) (Meltzer et al., 2019). However, ML can offer innovative solutions to enhance 
resilience without extensive capital investments. ML applications in the resilience of CISs can improve decision-
making and reduce socioeconomic losses caused by various possible disruptions.

needed to model the dynamic interaction concerning human factors and technical properties. ML presents itself 
as a viable solution for this purpose. For instance, it can help identify potential points of failure related to human 
factors, suggest proper decisions for mitigation, categorize disruptions (e.g., man-made, natural, and others), and 
assess the effect of human factors on system operational state and vulnerabilities caused by interdependencies 
across the entire system. For a comprehensive review of the role of human factors in modeling CINs resilience, 
refer to Magoua and Li (2023). 
• 
IoT Utilization through Wearables: One of the significant applications of IoT for resilience objectives can 
involve the utilization of wearable devices, commonly known as wearables (Alkhaleel, 2024). These smart 
devices include smartwatches, fitness trackers, and smart rings. As wearables are located on the human body, 
various information generated by them can be used to improve resilience planning, especially during disruption. 
Examples of such useful information might include information about the movement of people around a disrupted 
area, the location distribution of communities, the traffic conditions (Rizzo et al., 2022), the health status, 
including the number of injured people and deaths, and the current conditions of the environment (Alkhaleel, 
2024; Cureau et al., 2022). However, it is important to acknowledge challenges related to privacy, security, and 
other considerations (Alkhaleel, 2024; Sterbenz, 2017). Nonetheless, the decision-making process with the aid of 
ML could be improved by the integration of such data from sensors deployed across the affected geographical 
region with other data streams. 
 
5. Conclusion 
ML is a valuable and versatile tool with broad applications across various disciplines. In the context of resilience 
engineering, the field of ICISs resilience can significantly benefit from ML, as it enables data-driven decision-making 
under high-risk conditions. This article presents a comprehensive examination of different ML categories and a 
summary of the diverse types of interdependencies documented in the literature concerning ICISs. In addition, It also 
presents a review and exploration of the current literature covering ML applications in interconnected critical systems’ 
resilience. The discussed applications encompass areas such as interdependency and network topology modeling, IoT 
data analysis, IoP and textual analysis, and game theory and optimization. It is important to note the limited amount 
of research available in this domain, leaving many potential applications unexplored. Therefore, several future 
opportunities are highlighted, aiming to help the resilience engineering community embrace and utilize ML for the 
diverse applications available in this domain.

Abstract 
Long-term time series forecasting is an important research area for automated machine learning (AutoML). Currently 
forecasting based on either machine learning or traditional statistical model is usually built by experts and it requires 
significant manual effort: from model construction, feature engineering, and hyper-parameter tuning to construction 
of the time series model. Automation is not possible since there are too many human interventions. To overcome these 
limitations, this article proposed to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variant, Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM), through the memory cell and gates to perform long-term time series prediction. We have shown that this 
proposed approach is better than traditional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). In addition, we 
also found it is better than other neural network systems.

1. Introduction
Time series forecasting still remains a dynamic and active research area for statistical analysis and machine learning 
(ML), such as retail and financial industries. Currently, machine learning based tasks need professionals to understand 
and construct traditional time series forecasting models, and also require significant manual efforts. Automated 
Machine Learning (AutoML) plays an important role in tackling limitations. AutoML has been studied by Google   
Figure 1. AutoML Pipeline (Liang et al. 2020) 
Brain Team (2020) and also provides the pipeline of procedures (Figure 1). 
The AutoML approach aims to use raw data as input to produce a high-quality model output without human 
intervention. However, the forecasting accuracy for both traditional analysis and AutoML approaches degrades 
significantly in the long-term forecasting.

6. Conclusion 
Nowadays, time series analysis and forecasting have been studied by more techniques such as traditional statistical 
methods, machine learning and deep learning. The automated search is able to adjust the architecture and 
hyperparameter choices for different datasets, which makes the AutoML solution generic and automates the modeling 
efforts (Liang et al. 2020).  Meanwhile, the purpose of this study is to provide a solution in term of AutoML novelty 
when solving the long-term time series tasks. This article has provided analysis between classical statistical model 
ARIMA and multiple NNs, and empirically shown that ability and significance of neural network models on the 
seasonal and trended time series. Under the characteristics of AutoML, LSTM is suggested when we solve long-term 
time-series forecasting task. The finding of Emsafi et al. (2022) reveals how competitive are neural networks time-
series forecasting compared with traditional univariate methods.

Abstract 
The smart green supply chain (SGSC) is an emerging phenomenon because of the advancement of sustainable smart 
business and information technology trends. Various small and large enterprises are putting all their efforts into 
imbibing Industry 4.0 (I4.0) based disruptive technologies to transform their green supply chain management (GSCM) 
to be a smart green supply chain management (SGSCM) to fetch advantages of increased efficiency that leads to 
financial gain. Smart green supply chain management practices (SGSCMP) involving I4.0 disruptive technologies can 
provide greater transparency and quick decision-making. The SGSCMP must be assessed to work for I4.0 readiness 
to compete the global competitions. Hence, the present research attempts to assess the SGSCM-based practices 
adopted by manufacturers in KSA. Various SGSCMPs have been identified by carrying out the literature review. The 
Analytic hierarchy process with group decision-making (AHP-GDM) is used using the expert judgment of the expert 
group consisting of five experts. The expert group assessed the SGSCMP for their importance and three companies 
adopting such SGSCMP are analyzed for their ranking.

1. Introduction
The transformation of green supply chain management (GSCM) towards smart green supply chain management 
(SGSCM) will involve Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies that will provide the required “smartness:” to a company in 
their processes and technologies by enhancing data flow and its effective usage in cutting down and companies 
activities in real-time (Holmström et al., 2019). GSCM entails incorporating sustainable environmental processes into 
traditional supply chains. It incorporates the 4R1D (reuse, reduce, reclaim, recycle, and degradable) philosophy 
throughout the manufacturing, operations, and end-of-life management processes. Smart green supply chain 
management lowers waste and is a sort of supply chain management system that optimizes the movement of goods 
and services from suppliers to customers by utilizing modern technology and automated data analysis methodologies. 
A ""smart green supply chain"" is a concept that combines principles of sustainability and environmental responsibility 
with the use of advanced technologies and data-driven processes to create a more efficient, eco-friendly, and 
sustainable supply chain. It's an approach aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of supply chain operations 
while optimizing processes for cost-effectiveness and performance. These are the essential elements of a smart green 
supply chain. The smart SC helps the maker in a variety of ways. A smart system can anticipate a potential operational

Abstract 
Introduction: Achieving optimal quality and efficiency in the global health system requires balancing the workload of 
healthcare providers, particularly in resource-limited settings. Midwives, as essential healthcare professionals, play a 
significant role in improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the 
required number of midwives and evaluate their workload pressures in a maternity ward using the WISN Method. 
Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in 2021 among midwives in five departments of a 
specialized hospital. Results: Midwives at Batna Maternity Hospital accounted for 29.24% of the paramedical staff 
and 15.36% of the total workforce. The annual available working hours for midwives were 1367.53 ± 172.01 hours. 
In the delivery room, they allocated almost 81% of their available working time to basic activities, while the remaining 
time was dedicated to additional, categorical, or individual activities. The required number of midwives for these 
activities exceeded the available staff in four out of five units, resulting in a WISN ratio of 0.9 and a shortage of three 
midwives. The WISN ratio ranged from 0.83 to 1.12, indicating that these units had 83% to 112% of the necessary 
midwives, with the lowest ratio observed in the delivery room and the high-risk pregnancy service, facing the highest 
workload pressure. Conclusion: Workload pressures vary among different healthcare services, even within the same 
staff category. This highlights the importance of considering work processes, activity standards, and workload 
pressure when determining staffing needs.

6. Conclusion  
The varying workload pressures observed among different healthcare services, even within the same occupational 
category, highlight the importance of considering work processes, activity standards, and workload pressure when 
determining staffing requirements. This is particularly evident in the case of midwives working in maternity services 
at the Specialized Hospital Establishment in Batna, Algeria. The WHO's WISN methodology revealed staffing 
deficiencies in three of the five units, indicating a 8% overall shortfall in resources. The findings of this investigation 
emphasize the need for decision-makers to incorporate work process and activity standard considerations when 
devising strategies to address staffing needs. The study's results contribute to the existing body of research by shedding 
light on the specific challenges faced by midwives in Batna SHE and the importance of resource allocation in ensuring 
high-quality care without negatively influencing the well-being of healthcare providers. In conclusion, the research 
objectives have been met, and the study provides a unique contribution to the understanding of staffing requirements 
in maternity services.

Abstract 
Embarking on an exciting journey into the heart of Indonesia's government efficiency, this groundbreaking study 
unravels the secrets behind successful performance management in Central Government Organizations. Focusing on 
an array of Ministry/Agency Working units across the vibrant provinces of Lampung, this research delves into 74 
units under 13 Ministries/Institutions, spotlighting areas that have witnessed remarkable growth following the 
implementation of Budget Implementation Performance Indicators (IKPA). Employing an innovative mixed-method 
approach with an explanatory sequential design, this exploration merges detailed surveys with enlightening in-depth 
interviews. Our findings unveil a treasure trove of insights: the pivotal role of well-crafted performance measurement 
systems, the critical importance of their institutionalization, and the profound impact of individual factors in enhancing 
the use of performance information. These elements collectively forge a path to significant performance 
improvements. A striking revelation of this study is the profound influence of institutional pressures, particularly 
coercive and normative, in shaping employee behavior towards achieving performance targets. This research not only 
sheds light on the dynamics of performance management in Indonesia's public sector but also serves as a beacon for 
other governments striving for efficiency and effectiveness. This captivating study is a must-read for enthusiasts of 
performance measurement systems, institutional theory, and the intricacies of governmental isomorphism, offering a 
fresh perspective on transforming public sector performance.

1. Introduction
The change in governance from Traditional Public Administration to New Public Management (NPM) which focuses 
on the quality of performance measurement has begun to be implemented by many Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries since the 1990s (Akbar 2011). Legally, in Indonesia, the momentum 
for measuring the performance of government agencies as part of public accountability has been implemented since 
the reform era in 1999 marked by the issuance of Presidential Instruction Number 7 of 1999 concerning Accountability 
for Performance of Government Agencies (AKIP) (Akbar et al. 2012). In order to assess the performance of

Abstract 
Introduction: during COVID19, the Algerian health system was put under great strain. Despite its vulnerability, it 
adapted to the particular circumstances of this pandemic thanks to a profound modification of the organization of 
work. HCWs whose job is already known to cause anxiety are found exposed to the risk of professional burnout. 
Purpose: Assessment of the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the mental health of HCWs. Material and 
Method: cross-sectional study implemented in a COVID19 Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Burnout score is measured by 
the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Its statistical association is analyzed with professional, organizational 
factors and the resources made available. Two-sided tests were used, a significance threshold p ≤0.05; descriptive 
univariate and bivariate analysis (Pearson's Chi2 test) to test the association between the Burnout score and its 
dimensions with the other variables. Results: population of 78 HCWs; sex ratio = 0.30; psychometric properties of 
CBI (ɑ Cronbach = 0.88); Burnout: 94.3% including 17% in serious form. Doctors 16.7%, nurses 14.3%. Burnout is

5.1 Proposed Improvements 
The choice of time for our investigation at the immediate aftermath of a deadly wave of COVI19 would be at the 
origin of a difficulty in taking a critical look at caregivers' working conditions and their state of mental health 
deteriorated rather by the aggressiveness of the disease than by the efforts made. It would be more judicious to carry 
out questionnaire surveys away from major health events. 
 
Even if the factors favoring Burnout are not strongly present (statistically) in this study, the suffering of more than 
90% of the HCWs in this ICU must trigger preventive action in order to reduce the mental and emotional burden of 
these employees and provide total well-being at workplace with the aim of preserving the health of the HCW and the 
safety of the patient. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Burnout is occurring at alarming rates in this intensive care unit. The organization of work which has undergone 
drastic changes during the COVID19 pandemic with endless working days, a very high number of shifts per week 
and per month, an unimaginable number of patients to follow and at the interface, means of insufficient protection 
and resources, weak recognition, all these factors seem not to have contributed to altering the mental health of 
caregivers. These seem adapted to the extreme working conditions that the circumstances of the COVID19 
pandemic have installed. The probable cause of Burnout could be linked to the very nature of the disease, its severity 
and its prognosis.

Abstract 
This article aims to present the application of the Six Sigma methodology to improve the energy efficiency of trains 
running on Vale's Carajás Railroad in Brazil, one of the largest corridors for the transportation of iron ore and general 
cargo, consuming over three hundred million liters of diesel annually. One of Vale's commitments is to reduce its 
greenhouse gas emissions, and currently, it faces the challenge of reversing the trend of increasing diesel consumption 
due to a projected 2.1% increase in energy efficiency. The problem was identified, and the goal was defined based on 
historical performance. Processes were then mapped using a tree diagram, Pareto analysis, run chart, boxplot, and 
histogram. Diesel consumption in major flows was identified, and the causes were investigated and organized in a 
cause-and-effect diagram, prioritized for statistical investigation through correlation analysis and boxplot. 
Subsequently, proven causes were prioritized, a series of pilot tests were realized, and an effective action plan was 
implemented. The project brought sustainability and cost gains to EFC, reducing diesel consumption by 535,366.73 
liters, resulting in a real savings of US$ 546,311.15 and a reduction in emissions of 1,527,500.09 kg CO² eq. The 
projected real and potential gains for a one-year period amount to US$ 3,520,707.62 in Vale's costs. The project 
established a new record for the Energy efficiency of iron ore trains on the EFC.

Standardization stage  
In order to maintain control of the process and guarantee the sustainability of the results in the medium and long term, 
standards were created and revised from the operation of the iron ore loading terminal in Carajás, in the State of Pará, 
to the end of the journey with the arrival of the train at the Ponta da Madeira Maritime Terminal in São Luís, Maranhão, 
Brazil.  
 
Figure 9 shows the list of standard operating procedures and technical documents revised or created in this study. 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Standard Operational Procedures and Technical documents 
 
To ensure that everyone follows the revised standard operating procedures, more than five hundred operators have 
been trained in train driving and loading terminal operations. Also, to deal with possible daily deviations, the OCAP 
(Out control Action Plan) was implemented, as well as the revitalization of the daily management of efficiency 
performance with the addition of performance monitoring indicators in railway operation management.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The aim of this article was to describe the application of the Six Sigma methodology in the mining industry, with a 
focus on optimizing diesel consumption in the trains operated by Vale S.A. that run on the Carajás Railway, detailing 
the stages of identification, analysis and optimization of the critical factors related to diesel consumption in railway 
operations. The results presented in the case study and the use of Six Sigma tools associated with the PDCA method 
proved that the objective was achieved. 
 
The case study demonstrates the efficiency of Six Sigma methodology and the solutions resulting from the analysis 
made it possible to improve the energy efficiency of trains on the Carajás Railroad with: (i) a reduction in the 
consumption of 535,366.73 liters of diesel, (ii) increased loading of pellets in the GDU wagon, which has the highest 
capacity, (iii) reduction in variability, (iv) definition of parameters for energy efficiency by type of train, (v) increased 
number of locations where loaded ore trains are allowed to run at the Speed Limited of 80 km/h, (vi) reduction in 
stopping trains in yards with a planialtimetric survey, which increases diesel consumption, (vii) revision of the 
standard with optimization of the locomotives' tractor effort, (viii) reduction in carbon emissions. 
 
The obtained results not only met the established goal, but also point to significant gains for the sustainability of rail 
transportation. We believe that the findings presented here will serve as a basis for implementing more sustainable 
practices, promoting both economic and environmental benefits for any railroad. 
 
This important work, which focused on the ore train, is a pilot study that can be applied to other processes, such as the 
general cargo trains of Vale S.A. and VLI S.A. that run on the Carajás Railroad.

Abstract 
At an emergency room (ER) supplies, personnel and infrastructure must be ready and available to provide immediate 
care whenever is needed. Since these are limited resources, a good estimation of the near future patient volume might 
help when planning in advance. This research approaches the forecast of the patient volume at an ER by means of 
applying machine learning algorithms based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). The research was carried out 
following a 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. During the analysis, over 50,000 ER 
records preprocessed and sorted as daily time series. During the design, datasets, forecast horizons, SVM-based 
forecasting algorithms, and performance metrics were defined. The development was carried out entirely using the 
data processing software WEKA. Lastly, the validation was completed using held out data so that forecasts were 
compared to actual values. Forecasts based on linear regressions (LR) were used as baseline. The first approach 
consisted in using the cumulative data to forecast one month ahead, while the second approach considered only the 
last available month to forecast one month ahead. Besides MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE, the number of months 
where the forecast underestimated the actual value was also used to compare approaches. The results revealed that, 
when using cumulative time series, LR-based forecast underestimated the patient volume 8 out of 10 months. SVM-
based forecast underestimated only 2 out 10 months. When forecasting with the last available month, the 
underestimation was 6 out of 10 and 3 out of 10 respectively.  In conclusion, in some cases SVM-based forecasts can 
outperform LR-based forecasts. The availability of accurate patient volume estimations might serve well when 
planning and allocating resources.

Abstract 
Supervising the logistics and operations associated with air cargo transportation requires the expertise of an air freight 
specialist. In evaluation of an air freight specialists, several potentially conflicting quantitative and qualitative criteria 
needs to be taken into consideration, therefore a multicriteria decision making method (MCDM) is needed. In this 
research, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (F-AHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to 
Ideal Solution (F-TOPSIS) are integrated (F-AHP-TOPSIS) for assessment of airfreight specialist candidates of DHL 
Global Forwarding company. 15 criteria are determined with the help of 5 specialists acting as decision makers (DMs), 
and at first F-AHP is applied to determine criteria weights. Afterwards, utilizing these obtained weights, F-TOPSIS is 
implemented to rank 5 air freight specialist candidates.

1. Introduction
In a globally integrated business environment, logistics and air freight play significant roles. Efficient employee 
selection is essential for global companies since personnel and the working environment directly affect performance 
and productivity. An air freight specialist supervises the logistics and operations related with air cargo transportation. 
Responsibilities of the job include; regulations, tracking the goods, negotiating prices with airlines, documentation 
formatting, providing customer service and preparing internal presentations. Therefore, there are several substantial 
criteria to take into consideration while determining the best air freight specialist candidate.  
In this research, a global logistics company, DHL Global Forwarding’s air freight specialist candidate evaluation and 
selection process is studied. Due to the existence of various competing criteria in the decision process, an integrated 
MCDM method, namely F-AHP-TOPSIS is utilized to have both methods’ benefits. F-TOPSIS is easy to implement 
and provides stable results with a little effort, however in F-TOPSIS, guidelines to determine criteria weights are not 
specified. Therefore, a logical method such as F-AHP is required to obtain consistent, reliable criteria weights. 
Conversely, F-AHP, without integration with F-TOPSIS becomes burdensome, especially when there are too many 
alternatives and criteria since then DMs need to do large number of pairwise comparisons. With F-AHP-TOPSIS, air 
freight specialist alternatives can be ranked in a rational time, without too many complicated pairwise comparisons 
and calculations (Samanlioglu et al. 2018). Moreover, in F-AHP- TOPSIS, uncertainty and vagueness of assessments 
of DMs are captured with the help of linguistic variables and “fuzzy set theory” (Zadeh 1965; Zadeh 1994; Lootsma 
1997).   
In F-AHP-TOPSIS, first, F-AHP is applied to compute weights of assessment criteria and then F-TOPSIS is 
implemented to rank air freight specialist candidates from best to worst, utilizing the obtained weights.

Abstract 
Underestimation or overestimating activities’ duration in construction projects leads to many problems like lack of 
funding or procrastination. However, estimating duration accurately for construction projects is difficult because of 
many factors like identified and unidentified negative risks. This paper tried to estimate realistic durations of steel 
framing activities in a high-rise building using a combination of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and fuzzy logic 
algorithms with data from five similar projects. Initial planned durations and the top five pure risks are the inputs, and 
estimated actual durations are the outputs. The data from the first four projects was for training, and the fifth one was 
for simulation. Then, the estimated expected actual durations under uncertainties are compared to the actual durations 
of the project. The results showed that about 75% of the fifth project’s activities had errors of less than three days 
compared to the actual durations. 
Keywords 
Risk, Steel Framing Activities, Neural Networks and Construction. 
1. Introduction
More accurate duration estimation in construction projects is vital because time is crucial for all other project activities 
like cost estimation (time is money) and, most likely, completion date. Making mistakes in estimating activities’ 
duration in construction projects leads to liquidated damages, disputes, lack of funding, lack of resources and some 
things else for the contractors (Cheung and Chow, 2011; Wambeke and Liu, 2011). Also, duration overestimating will 
lead to a decrease in the productivity rate of workers and other project team members (Park et al., 2010; Kim et al., 
2011), and this prolongation may cause damage to equipment, resources, and materials (Le-Hoai et al., 2008; Chong 
and O’Connor, 2011; Kanoglu, 2003). Therefore, both under/overestimating would have a negative effect on the 
project outcomes and initial objectives.

As can be seen (Figures 5 and 6), the proposed algorithm could predict the expected actual durations based on the risk 
scores close to the actual durations of the activities. 
5. Conclusions
Trying to have accurate durations for activities in construction projects helps contractors avoid many problems like 
lack of funding or procrastination effect. Although precise estimation of the durations, because of many factors like 
identified and unidentified negative risks, also are difficult always to try to have better estimation using past data. In 
this paper, artificial intelligence algorithms using neural networks and fuzzy logic methods have been constructed to 
estimate steel framing activities. Data from four similar high-rise buildings were used to train the network. Data, as 
inputs included initial planned durations and actual scores of the five top risks for each project, and the outputs, were 
the actual durations of those activities. The network had eight input nodes with one output node. MAPE criteria were 
utilized to identify the number of nodes for the hidden layer. Based on the criteria, 9 nodes had the best performance 
and were consequently selected. Two membership functions were considered for the fuzzy part to calculate the error 
and send it to the neural network as feedback for online training and output improvement. For simulation, data from 
the fifth project was used. The inputs to the trained network were initially planned durations of the fifth project with 
their scores of five top risks. After that, the outputs (expected actual durations of the activities) were obtained. The 
obtained results were compared to the actual durations of the activities of the fifth project. According to the 
comparison, about 75% of 49 steel framing activities of the project had differences with the actual durations of less 
than 3 days. And the maximum difference was 8 days. The results showed the proposed algorithm can be used for 
other similar projects with the same characteristics.

Abstract 
In order to counteract climate change and thus herald the mobility transition from combustion engines to battery 
electric vehicles in Germany, the German government has set the target of registering a total of 15 million electric 
vehicles by the end of 2030. This is accompanied by enormous demands on battery logistics, as car manufacturers 
generally decide to have the finished battery systems installed in the bodywork at physically separate locations. Both 
the transportation of lithium-ion batteries as hazardous goods and their storage are subject to a large number of 
regulatory requirements. In particular, the handling of critical or critical/defective batteries is complex from a logistics 
perspective in terms of regulation. In order to keep lithium-ion batteries in the cycle for a correspondingly long time 
and to ensure that a circular economy can function in general, several stakeholders from different groups must 
collaborate with each other. Once the battery has reached around 80% state-of-health, the end of the automotive 
application has been reached. However, this does not mean that it has to be recycled immediately in line with the 
circular economy. The aim is to extend the life of the battery, for example as second-life energy storage. Other so-
called ""R strategies"", e.g. reuse or remanufacturing, are also conceivable alongside recycling, depending on the state 
of health determined. Once the end-of-life of the battery has been reached, it must be recycled using various processes 
so that critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt or nickel can be recovered.

Abstract 
When practicing their profession, doctors undergo considerable stress and lead a poor lifestyle. They are prone to 
early death. The Algerian health system has not planned a program for systematically capturing deaths occurring 
among doctors. Such a tool makes it possible to assess the prevalence of early death, to understand its causes and to 
establish a national surveillance and prevention program. Convince the Health authorities of the implementation of 
an administrative death capture system and health monitoring and of the need to install a physician mortality 
observatory. Estimate the number of deaths - describe the sociodemographic and professional aspects of deceased 
doctors - classify the causes of mortality. Retrospective descriptive study, based on the collection of information 
concerning the deaths of surviving practicing doctors during the decade 2010 - 2020. It is based on global research 
on social networks, the written and online press, and contact by messaging or by telephone from admins, parents, 
and colleagues. 57 deaths, including 27 during COVID19, 34 men and 23 women, 11 resident doctors, 4 orthopedic 
surgeons, 16 work in a university hospital. The causes in decreasing order of frequency: sudden death – suicide –

Abstract 
The concepts of Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma have been applied in manufacturing companies with greater 
frequency. However, there are few records of its implementation in companies in the service sector. This sector in 
Peru represents more than 50.6% of the country's Gross Domestic Product and it is composed mainly of small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Nevertheless, this kind of businesses are characterized by having low productivity, 
lack of organization and monitoring of performance indicators to make good decisions. Therefore, different techniques 
are required to maintain their efficiency and productivity over time to meet the expectations of the consumers. In this 
research, the objective is to propose a management model by applying Lean Six Sigma in order to improve the 
performance of an SME in the professional services sector. Through the DMAIC process, a diagnosis of the company 
was carried out, finding the root causes of its main problems, Lean tools such as 5s and virtual Kanban were applied 
in a pilot test in the organization. After implementation, 100% efficiency was obtained, a productivity improvement 
of 75.56% and a decrease in order delivery time of 42.30%. Finally, the pilot test was validated using a statistical 
analysis of variance test and demonstrated consistency with the management model applying lean six sigma. This 
work contributes to practical knowledge with the application of a lean six sigma tool model and to be expanded in 
future work in companies in the service sector.

A Simulation-Optimisation Approach to Assess the Impact 
of Covid-19 Movement Control Orders on Supply Chain

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted economies worldwide, particularly the supply chains (SCs) of various 
industries. This research was aimed at investigating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the manufacturing SC in 
Malaysia. The study employed an optimisation model to simulate the effects of various movement control orders 
(MCOs) on the SC. Through an analysis using the SC disruption simulation model, it became evident that an optimal 
recovery plan depends largely on both the recovery duration and manufacturing capacity. The longer the recovery 
duration, the longer the optimal recovery plan that is needed if the manufacturing capacity is not considerable. 
Moreover, the number of backorders and sales lost will increase as well if the disruption cannot be recovered within 
a short period of time. Based on the simulation results, some suggestions have been proposed to mitigate the impact 
of an adverse disruption and strengthen the SC. These include having emergency stock to prevent stock-outs and 
utilising inventory strategies to overcome the issue of raw material shortages. In addition, manufacturers can reduce 
the total cost of recovery by adjusting the optimal manufacturing capacity to ensure customer demand can be met with 
minimal losses.

1. Introduction
A supply chain (SC) is defined as a network of organisations and their suppliers to produce and distribute a specific 
product to the final purchaser. This network involves a range of operations, individuals, organisations, knowledge, 
and services. The SC often reflects the steps taken to get the product or service from its original state to the consumer 
(Donne, 2012; Ganeshan & Harrison, 1995; Gupta, 2014; Kenton, 2020). The SC is effectively a major tool that 
enables a company to save on costs and stay competitive in a business (Kenton, 2020). According to Janvier-James 
(2011), a SC plays an important role in improving the efficiency of a business. This is because it facilitates processes 
such as production, trade, transport, and supplies worldwide.  
During the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for healthcare products increased dramatically, causing drastic shortages 
in healthcare products from around the world and disruptions to the medical SC. Therefore, the effect of the pandemic 
on the SC was unpredictable. Moreover, this pandemic led to a drop in productivity as people failed to perform in 
their respective companies and industries. This was because employees, especially those working in production lines,

The manufacturing capacity was lower during the recovery duration, forcing the companies to deal with the B and L. 
When the manufacturing capacity is disrupted, the B and L will be affected and increase. While customer demands 
can be maintained by the B, the L can result in the loss of customers. In contrast, a company will lose its customers as 
a result of L. The recovery duration is critical because Bq might become Lq if the recovery duration is prolonged. 
 
3.2 Mitigating the Impacts of Supply Chain Disruptions 
During the recovery duration, supply and demand will fluctuate. The sudden lack of supply and high demand will 
cause the SC system to have an out-of-stock issue. Most efforts are focused on two main scenarios: either all the 
demand during the stockout period is back-ordered, or all the demand during the stockout period is lost forever 
(Montgomery et al., 1973; Vakharia & Yenipazarli, 2008). According to Thomopoulos (2011), when customers refuse 
to wait for stocks to be replenished and cancel their orders, it is considered as a loss in sales. There are several 
suggestions for minimising the effect of stockouts. It is important to have a safety stock in the warehouse in case of 
an emergency. When the overall demand increases, the manufacturer can run production instantly to provide a better 
level of service by meeting the increasing demand with stocks and decreasing the back orders from the retailers. It is 
better to have a guideline from inventory management to balance the amount of supply and demand to prevent 
overstocking during a pandemic. 
 
Furthermore, the disruption impact to the SC can be reduced by controlling the manufacturing capacity in order to 
minimise the total recovery costs. Hence, a match capacity strategy is suggested. In this strategy, smaller incremental 
modifications are made to the manufacturing capacity instead of boosting the demand ahead of time or increasing the 
demand after the existing capacity is depleted (Paton et al. 2011). This is done in response to changing market 
conditions. Despite its complexity, most producers will find this to be a safer bet than other capacity-planning 
strategies because it is considerably more risk-averse. To prevent the scenario of overcapacity and undercapacity, a 
company can make use of certain software programs such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and warehouse 
management systems (WMS) to estimate a suitable capacity during a pandemic. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The impact of disruptions to the performance of SCs in relation to Covid-19 during the pandemic was investigated. 
The SC disruption model revealed that the recovery duration and manufacturing capacity were proportional to the 
optimum recovery plan and total costs incurred. Although the backorders increased with recovery duration, the lost 
sales decreased. Therefore, it can be concluded that the longer the recovery duration, the higher the cost that will have 
to be borne by the manufacturer. Several suggestions have been discussed to overcome this scenario. Manufacturers 
should have a safety stock in their warehouses to avoid a significant surge in demand. Moreoever, a match capacity 
strategy can be applied to manage manufacturing and production capacities based on demand during a pandemic. 
 
Future research can be conducted to create simulation models with multi-stage SCs that include suppliers, 
manufacturers, warehouses, and consumers in order to replicate a more realistic situation. Furthermore, this model 
can be improved with more than one supplier and retailer to align the SC with reality.

Abstract 
In a society in constant growth, banking institutions have been forced to satisfy more and more the needs of their 
clients. Among the most requested services are the bank loans, particularly those intended for medium and large-sized 
companies. This study deals with the development of a proposal to improve the evaluation stage of the business 
banking credit process, this stage has a duration of 12 days, generating cost overruns and multiple sources of waste. 
The implementation of the Lean thinking, Business process management and the use of simulation will be used to 
achieve the objectives. The results obtained were as expected, demonstrating that by implementing different 
improvements in certain critical activities, an improvement of 16.12% can be achieved, thus reducing the duration of 
the stage by 2 days.

1. Introduction
The constant growth of the banking sector has made it more competitive every day. As a result, consumers are 
increasingly looking for the best options that can satisfy their needs and provide innovative services. One of the main 
services that has been highly demanded is the granting of bank loans, mainly by the corporate banking department, 
which is aimed at companies of different sizes and industries. 
Currently, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, bank lending to corporate clients has become saturated. This is due to the 
emergence of new companies that need capital to start their business activities. This study will evaluate the corporate 
bank lending process of a medium-sized bank and optimize its activities to reduce the turnaround time. The credit 
process consists of 4 stages: Admission, in which the necessary documentation is requested to prepare and review the 
initial credit proposal; evaluation, in which the documentation received is verified, recorded and the economic 
evaluation is performed; approval, in which the applicant company's autonomy is approved and a definitive credit 
proposal is obtained; and finally formalization, in which a credit line is created, reviewed and approved for the 
company. 
In the quality management system of the banking company there is a continuous improvement process that includes 
the review of indicators. Through this process it has been possible to detect that the main problem is the number of 
days that the whole process takes, which lasts 26 days. This research focused on the evaluation stage, where an 
approximate time of 12 days is estimated, generating cost overruns and multiple sources of waste.

6. Conclusion  
Finally, with respect to the objectives of the research, the main objective was achieved, which was to implement 
improvements to reduce the attention time in the evaluation stage of the credit process of the banking company. In 
order to meet this objective, several limitations had to be overcome, such as contacting the customer service personnel 
to obtain the necessary access to enter the entity, as well as scheduling a meeting with the analyst and the manager of 
the corporate banking area so that they could provide us with more detailed information on the credit evaluation 
processes and their main problems in executing them.  
  
As conclusions, it was determined that it is possible to improve the attention time in the activities of a process through 
different methodologies, in the particular case of the study through the use of Lean Thinking, which helped greatly to 
eliminate the dead times that occurred in the critical activities previously analyzed. Likewise, the use of different 
engineering tools allowed us to first identify the root cause of these problems, and based on this we were able to 
perform a more detailed analysis of the process and a simulation that showed us that by implementing the proposed 
improvements, the evaluation process would be carried out in two working days less. In addition, the number of 
documents analyzed per year would increase by an average of 15%.

Abstract 
This paper studies the relationship between organizational culture (OC) and innovation in small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) in the aerospace industry (AI) of the state of Querétaro, Mexico. For this purpose, the research 
strategy consisted in analyzing  five case studies in SMEs of AI in Querétaro in 2023. The empirical analysis was 
carried out through a series of key factors of OC to demonstrate the development of an innovation culture. The study 
shows a positive relationship between OC and innovation activities in the evaluated SMEs.

1. Introduction
Innovation has increasingly become recognized as a key influence on business competitiveness, regions, cities and 
nations (Asheim et al., 2011). There is a growing interest in the analysis of OC as a main variable that influences 
innovation processes in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in medium-high technology sectors (Tang et al., 
2020; Lijauco et al., 2020; Dabić et al., 2019; Sánchez-Báez et al., 2019). The dynamism of innovation in  SMEs 
depends on the introduction and adoption of new technologies,  new organizational forms and the implementation of 
OC that encourages innovation activities. SMEs face many barriers to innovate, including organizational factors, there 
is a great opportunity for SMEs  to innovative by removing these barriers (Connolly et al., 2012). 
The development of AI in Queretaro has been maintained for the last ten years and has been consolidating as the 
region of Mexico that records the highest growth in terms of economic indicators.  Between 2010 and 2020 the foreign 
direct investment (FDI) accumulated in the aerospace sector of Queretaro amounted to 1,300 million usd , making it 
the region with the highest index of FDI in Mexico. Currently the state of Querétaro has some of the key company-
players in the AI like: Bombardier, Airbus, GE, Safran, ITP and PCC Aerostructures, it also has the first and only 
university specialized in the AI in Mexico, (Universidad Aeronáutica de Querétaro), (FEMIA, 2022). 
SMEs dedicated to AI in Mexico need a culture that develops and establishes values and attitudes prone to promote 
ideas and changes that lead to improvements the operation and efficiency of enterprises. The aim is to examine the 
influence of OC in fostering innovation in SMEs of medium-high technology in the s in the  aerospace sector in 
Mexico. For this purpose, we focused on multiple exploratory case studies in five SMEs of AI located in the state of 
Queretaro, Mexico.

Figure 3. Organizational innovation index results 
 
The indicator analyzes the degree of cohesion that exists in SMEs to generate changes in the organization focused on 
innovation. The SME with the highest index is GICS with 92%, followed by ITM with 75% and CRA with 69%, for 
this indicator AEROM presents 67%, and finally the company TECHB with 49%. 
The case studies show that SMEs dedicated to AI with the highest scores in the indexes are undoubtedly better able to 
foster innovation processes and develop technological capabilities. In a highly complex industry, the generation of 
radical and incremental innovations is required. 
 
Some of the main characteristics of the SMEs with the highest scores in the analyzes, such as the GICS and CRA are: 
 
• 
They are enterprises with the objectives aligned to a common project. 
• 
Creativity is constantly promoted and rewarded, failure is not sanctioned because it is recognized as part of 
the learning process. 
• 
Knowledge is shared, and employees are trained to improve their skills 
 
6. Conclusions 
The case studies show that SMEs dedicated to AI with the highest scores in the indexes are able to foster innovation 
processes and develop technological capabilities. In a highly complex industry, the generation of radical and 
incremental innovations is required. A culture of innovation in SMEs reconciles and integrates the attitudes and 
behaviors of reative people to respond to the demands of the aerospace industry. The key is to implement this type of 
culture by the management and encourage employee participation. The results show that organizational culture has a 
positive influence on innovation activities, which is consistent whit previous research (Tang et al., 2020; Lijauco et 
al., 2020; Dabić et al., 2019; Sánchez-Báez et al., 2019). The research has some limitations, first, the analysis focused 
only on SMEs dedicated AI. Medium and large companies were not taken for the study. Secondly, the study was 
applied in SMEs only in the state of Queretaro, there are other states that are developing innovation capabilities in 
Mexico. The third limitation, the sample size is relatively small to apply other types of analysis (for example, statistical 
analysis or quantitative models). 
 
Future research emerges from this study, it is feasible to apply the study in medium-sized, large enterprises and leading 
companies in the AI worldwide that are located in Mexico (for example, Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, Aernnova). 
Another line of research focuses on studying the relationship between OC and innovation from other quantitative and 
qualitative methodological perspectives.

Abstract 
The aerospace and medicinal industries pay close attention to lattice structures. Because they help reduce weight by 
replacing of the internal solid portion of the blade with different lattice structures.  Applying of these technology 
taking into account for achieving appropriate homogenization between the material, unit cell, and additive 
manufacturing (AM) technology. Lattice structures with topology optimization have a great potential and flexibility 
offered to the designers working in the area of designing lightweight structures as well as high strength at the same 
time compared with solid form structures. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the designing of graded density 
structures of various lattice designs for dense materials with thermo-mechanical behavior of numerous lattice-based 
configurations (such as Gyroid and X-cell were applied for a turbine blade. The main goal is for reducing the weight 
of the turbine blade to achieve the best mechanical, thermal properties. 
Keywords 
Lattice structure, Gyroid structure, Diamond structure, Additive Manufacturing. 
1. Introduction
Many industries, particularly the aerospace and medicinal industries, pay close attention to lattice structures. Because 
they help reduce weight by replacing of the internal solid portion of the blade with gyroid lattice structures while 
taking into account achieving appropriate homogenization between the material, unit cell, and AM technique. 
Therefore, in order to build blades with better end-use properties, it is essential to understand the topological 
interaction between lattices and the materials that make up their component parts. 
2. Literature Review
The manufacture of lightweight lattice structures with complex geometries and the appropriate material compositions 
is possible using additive manufacturing (AM) techniques was presented by Saleh et al. (2022) and Thompson et al. 
(2016). These techniques can also be used to create lattice structures that offer a unique set of mechanical, thermal, 
and optical properties. For example, Shi (2020) tested various structures made by SLM at different densities. They 
designed and tested Gyroid, Diamond, IW, and Primitive designs of lattice structures for compression effectiveness 
and energy absorption. Many industries, particularly the aerospace and medicinal industries, pay close attention to 
lattice structures. Because they help reduce weight and make it easier to manage a component's mechanical and 
physical characteristics, lattice structures are necessary according to Tang, Yunlong et al. (2015) and Cutolo, Antonio, 
(2020). Additionally, lattice structures allow for flexibility in design without the need to complete alter the structural 
shape according to Du, Yuexin et al. (2020) and Yonekura, Kazuo (2023). This is what motivates lattice structures to 
be used in the production of turbine blades. Irrespective to the method of achieving the desired lattice structure in the 
material there is an upmost need to maintain the homogeneity in the material and its unit cells arrangement. AM is 
considered one of those techniques that can maintain the said homogeneity. It can be seen in a study presented by 
Duan et al. (2020), wherein the authors have employed AM to produce blades having graded lattice structures instead

Abstract 
The increase in automation due to the changing market and the expansion of product diversity has led to an increase 
in the demand for more sophisticated equipment. As a result, the dependability and maintainability of equipment have 
become critical in managing the quantity and quality of the products produced. Therefore, preventive maintenance 
(PM) should be performed during the manufacturing process in order to ensure the stipulated reliability and 
dependability of the production process specifications. Unscheduled PM, on the other hand, can have detrimental 
financial implications for the company, as well as a reduction in the overall production line reliability. This work 
considers a realistic multi-objective PM scheduling problem in a production line at a local Saudi glass plant. The 
reliability of the production line, maintenance costs, and system downtime are measured as multiple objectives, and 
different thresholds are applied for the available budget and maintenance periods. The aim is to apply a mathematical 
model to maximize the system’s reliability and minimize overall costs. The results of the multi-objective model have 
shown a significant decrease in cost of about 12%.

1. Introduction
The role of maintenance and reliability in today’s manufacturing environment is critical for most firms. Constant and 
reliable maintenance planning can ensure a steady-state manufacturing process. The complexity of automated systems 
has recently grown as a result of rapid changes in technology. Proper maintenance planning and control strategies are 
vital, particularly in the manufacturing industry, which uses expensive and specialized equipment and has stringent 
environmental requirements. With the loss of profits due to the neglect of the importance of maintenance and reliability 
in such industries, there is a need for better maintenance planning and scheduling. 
 Traditional factory management rules are different from current tactics used to control production and maintenance. 
Due to the wide range of variables that affect the performance of production and control activities, these techniques 
are more predictable and adaptable. Production scheduling plays a key role in production management. Production 
scheduling may need to consider the state of the manufacturing system and the operating circumstances in the 
production environment. Decision support systems are widespread in industrial engineering because they enable 
managers to control their resources based on various production limitations on a more general level. Due to 
complicated manufacturing systems, decision support systems resolve to integrate several technologies with human 
resources, eventually resulting in a high-efficiency production process. 
Local production plants in Saudi Arabia with substantial capital investments tend to spend money to improve quality, 
safety, maintainability, and reliability, resulting in a declining profit margin for the company. When the production

6. Conclusions and Future Work 
In this article, we study production line systems and how to improve reliability and maintenance activities while 
decreasing maintenance costs. The reliability of the system in a production company is an essential factor in measuring 
the performance of any company. Therefore, in this work, quality improvement and reliability optimization 
approaches have been used to find the best maintenance policy for the given problem. The current work focused on a 
segment of a production line with a total number of 35 components in a local glass plant to implement our approach; 
in fact, we tried to cover different components with divergent quality and reliability characteristics to gain a better 
understanding of the reliability of the whole system. 
 
 Mathematical optimization is the most common approach to designing the best possible outcome for industrial 
problems; indeed, that was the case for the current problem. In this work, a multi-objective PM scheduling problem 
is considered in a production line at a local Saudi glass plant. Reliability of the production line, maintenance costs, 
and system downtime are measured as multiple objectives, and different thresholds are applied for available budget 
and maintenance periods. It is found that applying a near-optimal preventive maintenance plan to the factory can 
reduce downtime and reduce unnecessary costs by at least 12%, resulting in about 400,000 SAR savings.  
 
 For future work, genetic algorithms could be used to overcome the computational obstacles faced due to the size of 
the problem, especially if the problem grows in size by adding a higher number of components. Moreover, applying 
machine learning approaches, such as clustering techniques, is among future directions that would help overcome the 
computational burden of reliability optimization and maintenance scheduling problems. In addition, developing a 
stochastic nonlinear model with random adjustment and replacement times can also be one of the future directions of 
the current work.

Abstract 
The transformation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones is one of the most essential reactions in organic synthesis. An 
interesting alternative to aerobic conditions to produce oxygenated products, such as aldehydes and ketones, can be 
the dehydrogenation of alcohols under anaerobic conditions with the utilization of unsaturated organic molecules as 
hydrogen acceptors, instead of molecular oxygen. In this case, the oxidative dehydrogenation is changed to transfer 
dehydrogenation, which overcomes the safety limitations of aerobic oxidation. The influence of varying the stabilizer 
type (PVA, PVP, and THPC) during the synthesis of palladium nanoparticles via sol-immobilization technique on the 
resulted particles, and their catalytic activity on the liquid phase transfer dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol (1-PhEt) 
has been investigated for the first time. The chemical composition and morphology of the fresh and used catalysts 
were determined using XRD, XPS, BET, SEM-EDX, and TEM. By evaluating the catalytic activity of the series of 
1% Pd/TiO2 catalysts prepared using different PVA/Pd weight ratio, the results illustrate that two main parameters 
can mainly control the catalytic activity of 1% Pd/TiO2 in the liquid phase transfer dehydrogenation of 1-PhEt, these 
are Pd(0)/Pd(II) ratio and the particle size of the catalyst. The results show that two different regimes can be identified 
during the liquid phase transfer dehydrogenation of 1-PhEt. At the initial time, the particle size parameter appears to 
control the catalytic performance of 1-PhEt while the effect of Pd oxidation state starts to take place after reaching 
iso-conversion, where the percentage of Pd(0)/Pd(II) increases while the reaction proceeds.

Abstract 
The adoption of Additive Manufacturing technologies is on the rise owing to the benefits that can be gained from the 
technology, such as environmental sustainability, supply chain responsiveness and mass customization capabilities. 
These benefits arise mostly due to the digital design nature of the technology which provides immense design freedom. 
However, these digital designs are also susceptible to cybersecurity risks. To tackle these challenges, researchers are 
exploring the integration of Blockchain with Additive manufacturing. However, there are challenges and 
considerations associated with this integration. This study identifies these challenges from existing academic and 
practitioners’ literature and finds the hierarchical and causal relationship between them using fuzzy DEMATEL. This 
study fills the existing literature gap by finding the solutions to the current debate on the cybersecurity threats 
associated with Additive manufacturing technologies. The practitioners can use this study to be better prepared and 
ensure the smooth adoption and implementation of the technology.

1. Introduction
In the last decade, the world has witnessed several events that highlight the need for operations and supply chains to 
be more robust, resilient, and environmentally sustainable. While the COVID-19 pandemic demanded resilient supply 
chains, the world events caused due to climate crises, demand a circular economy and decarbonization across the 
supply chain and in all operations. Moreover, with the increasing demand for customized goods, there needs to be a 
higher focus on resilience, flexibility, and environmental sustainability (Priyadarshini et al., 2023). Though industries 
and organisations are working hard on these fronts, they have not succeeded in achieving these goals.  
Previous researchers have highlighted the importance of Industry 4.0 technologies in the fulfilment of these objectives. 
Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is an Industry 4.0 technology that involves a layer-on-layer 
joining of materials to manufacture a product (ASTM F2792-12, 2012). AM has numerous benefits for the supply 
chain. AM allows for part consolidation due to its additive nature. This minimises the requirement for tools, jigs, and 
fixtures (Berman, 2020). Consequently, the weight of the final product is decreased while the strength is enhanced. In 
addition, through the consolidation of several components, additive manufacturing (AM) contributes to the reduction 
of supply chain intermediaries. This minimises the complexity of the supply chain and improves the agility of the 
supply chain. Moreover, this also contributes to reducing the expenses associated with operations (Rinaldi et al., 2021). 
However, there are certain risks associated with the technology. The digital nature of the technology poses risks where 
digital designs can be easily copied and where counterfeit goods can be produced easily. Owners of 3D printers have 
the option to purchase licenced designs for 3D printing. However, there is a possibility that these owners may print

5. Conclusion 
This study aimed to identify the factors that pose a barrier to the integration of Blockchain technology with Additive 
manufacturing. First, the factors were identified from the literature. Then, using fuzzy DEMATEL, the hierarchical 
and cause-and-effect relationship between the factors was established. This study fills an existing gap in the literature 
by integrating 2 Industry 4.0 technologies. First. AM is used as a means to tackle resilience, mass customization, and 
environmental sustainability needs. Then, Blockchain is used to mitigate the risks associated with AM. However, this 
study goes a step ahead in identifying the barriers to the integration of these technologies. Practitioners can use the 
results to understand how to improve the performance of AM and be aware of the risks associated with blockchain 
integration with AM. The study also has some limitations. The study also has some limitations. Despite being highly 
useful for firms and researchers, the study cannot be generalised because due to a smaller number of respondents and 
just a few representative sectors. The results could further be validated through an empirical study or case studies from 
various sectors. Based on the results, the study groups the factors in cause and effect. These factors can then be used 
to propose a model which can be quantitatively tested using structural equation Modelling and qualitatively verified 
using semi-structured interviews.

Abstract 
This study presents a diagnostic framework for healthcare using explainable artificial intelligence and machine 
learning. Previous studies show that the ability of prediction models greatly depends on the relevance and 
independence of the feature set. Hence, various feature selection methods are presented in the literature. Moreover, 
the previous medical diagnostic models using neural networks offer accurate predictions, however, without generating 
explicit decision rules. A novel research framework with incremental feature selection and interpretable machine 
learning is proposed. First non-redundant and relevant features are selected. Further, the initial weights obtained during 
feature learning are fed to the interpretable neural network to obtain global and local explanations. This proposed 
research framework is demonstrated with an open-source medical dataset related to glioma, and the best-fit model is 
obtained. Moreover, an app for glioma grading is developed with the underlying predictive model to offer decision 
support to physicians and patients.

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the field of medical diagnostics by recognizing the underlying pattern 
of medical conditions and symptoms that is beyond human cognition (Kumar et al. 2023). Diagnostic decision support 
systems enable clinicians to make accurate and timely diagnoses by mining rapidly growing patient data in a 
temporally evolving domain and further predicting the progression of health conditions across the recovery and 
treatment pathways (Sutton et al. 2020). Artificial neural network (ANN) is widely used in the development of robust 
decision support systems solving complex and unstructured problems with high predictive performance (Shahid, 
Rappon, and Berta 2019). However, the decision-making process and the inherent decision rules applied in making 
predictions for a patient are hidden to the clinicians and they design disease management program without this critical 
knowledge that are often not effective. Explainability and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models have 
unleashed the fullest potential of such systems and the decision rules generalized by the learned models help in better 
treatment delivery, recovery, and help providing timely preventive medicine (Joyce et al. 2023).  
In this study, an intelligent interpretable framework for developing clinical decision support system which is illustrated 
using glioma dataset provided by UCI Machine Learning repository (Tasci et al. 2022). The independence and 
significance of the features are ensured by a filter approach that uses ant colony optimization (ACO) with mutual 
information gain as its fitness function. Then, the reduced data is taken further to explore various learners such as, 
Naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) that yield the best 
accurate prediction. Using wrapper approach, the least significant features are eliminated and the feature importance 
derived from the best fit model is further used as the initial weight vector while training a prediction model with 
artificial neural network (ANN) for early convergence and better performance. The predictive power with random and

The underlying model behind this application is developed based on the proposed approach. This can be used as an 
informal screening mechanism which can be further validated and investigated by clinicians.   
 
The study has significant research implications. The role of incremental feature selection and precomputing initial 
weights for ANN in improving the prediction performance of ANN-based prediction model is demonstrated. Results 
of the proposed approach outperformed those presented in the previous studies.   
 
6. Conclusions 
This study presents incremental feature selection and interpretable learning using neural network. The proposed 
framework is demonstrated using glioma dataset and the results are compared with the benchmark performance 
measures. It is found that the proposed method outperformed other feature selection methods, learners and their 
different combinations of these. This framework is applicable for performing prediction modelling in any problem 
domain. Future researchers can deploy this framework to solve prediction problems with varying number of 
dimensions and instances. However, the choice of the feature selection method should be based on the dimensionality 
and heterogeneity of the instances. An app has been developed with the trained and validated model and can be used

as a decision support tool. The dataset used for training is collected from patients in a particular geographical region. 
The model should be further trained with cross-country dataset for wider use.

Abstract 
Effective traffic prediction is crucial due to a surge in deliveries by commerce and urbanization. This has led to a 
notable rise in traffic within megacities, causing route delays to the final destinations and countless vehicle accidents. 
E-commerce has been in a constant boom, as buying something online and having it delivered to the front door is
easier than going to the store. As more people engage in this activity, e-commerce platforms' challenges are more
complicated and need to be addressed faster. However, these challenges escape the delivery company's scope when
external factors influence the objective of optimized deliveries, for example, traffic issues or bad weather during the
last mile, issues that are only exacerbated where traffic sensors are not widely used (i.e., underdeveloped countries).
The main contributions of this research are to (1) provide a contextual foundation of current frameworks used for
traffic prediction, (2) use social media and multi-modal traffic-related data (weather, points of interest, calendar of
events) by leveraging social network analysis to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction, and (3) to show a
methodology that can be used for partially observed traffic. The proposed methodology includes deep learning tools
like Long-Short Term Memory Networks, attention mechanisms, Graph Convolutional Networks, and social media
tools like sentiment analysis.

1. Introduction
Urbanization is a direct consequence of population growth. Cities with more than 1 million habitants will rise by 
almost 30% from the year 2018 (548 habitants) to 2030 (706 habitants), and the number of megacities with more than 
10 million inhabitants is “projected to rise from 33 in 2018 to 43 in 2030” (UN, 2018). These megacities are located 
all over the world, from New York in North America and London in the United Kingdom to Lima in Peru, Bogota in 
Colombia, and Mexico City in Mexico. However, these are generally located in the southern hemisphere. Population 
growth would not have a concerning impact on everyday life if it increased inhabitants in rural areas, but that is not 
the case. Population density in urban areas has always been increasing, but since 2010, urban areas have a higher

Abstract 
This study investigates the complex landscape of information system disruptions within government organizations, 
exploring challenges, opportunities, and their implications. Organizations and information systems practices are still 
plagued by the high failure rates of information systems development (ISD) projects. For many years, the information 
systems discipline has been deeply concerned about this situation, which has led information systems researchers to 
concentrate on and thoroughly investigate ISD project failure. ISD project failure scholarship is being challenged by 
the growing complexity and unpredictability of ISD projects and modern system development procedures. In this 
paper, we pose the following questions: What are the strengths and shortcomings of the current body of literature on 
ISD project failure and success? What directions might the ISD literature go in the future? In order to address these 
issues, we first provide an overview of the literature that evaluates the contributions made by researchers within the 
three main schools of thought on ISD failure: rationalist, process, and narrative. 
Even if the current body of study from all angles adds a great deal to our understanding, we discover that researchers 
are still fixated on ""project failure"" as the culmination of an ISD effort. When difficult circumstances arise during ISD 
initiatives before they collapse, they pay little attention to them. We then make the case, based on the review and 
criticism of the literature, that it is highly advantageous to shift the focus of research from ISD project failure to ""ISD 
project distress,"" which we define as a detrimental project condition involving a dynamic and fluid constellation of 
critical issues that are challenging to recognize, comprehend, and address. ISD project distress is a problem that is 
becoming more dangerous and significant, but little is known about its characteristics and possible remedies. Drawing 
on the literature on sensemaking, 
The study recognizes the increasing reliance on information systems in modern governance and aims to 
comprehensively analyze the multifaceted impacts of disruptions on government operations. Employing a mixed-
method approach, the research combines qualitative insights from interviews and document analysis with quantitative 
data from surveys. The qualitative analysis uncovers common challenges such as employee resistance and technical 
complexities, while quantitative data quantifies the impact on government functions. Findings reveal a spectrum of 
disruptions, ranging from data security concerns to innovative practices and opportunities for citizen-centric services. 
The research contributes to the field by offering actionable recommendations for government organizations, enhancing 
governance practices, and facilitating cross-border knowledge transfer. This study not only illuminates the intricacies 
of information system disruptions but also paves the way for informed strategies and policies in the evolving digital 
landscape of government operations.

Strategies and Best Practices had The study has yielded insights on tactics and best practices for mitigating the 
difficulties arising from disruptions in information systems. These include suggestions for adopting flexible and 
scalable technology, engaging stakeholders, and managing change effectively. 
 
Citizen-Centric Services refer to Qualitative data has revealed the transformative potential of information system 
disruptions, allowing government organizations to tailor their services to meet the expectations and demands of 
citizens. Findings suggest an increased focus on aligning government services with citizen expectations, thereby 
contributing to overall citizen satisfaction. 
 
Policy and Governance Implications hold thorough analysis of government documents and policy reports has unveiled 
far-reaching implications for policy and governance. The research findings emphasise how important it is to have 
governance structures and policies that are flexible enough to respond to the unpredictable nature of information 
technology disruptions in government agencies. The in-depth examination of international and comparative data has 
provided insightful information derived from many nations and governmental systems. This will be the focus of 
International and Comparative Perspectives. It is anticipated that these revelations will deepen our comprehension of 
information system disruption management tactics in diverse international settings. 
 
5.1 Proposed Improvements 
It is expected that the research would result in the creation of practical suggestions for government agencies. These 
suggestions will provide useful direction for government organisations trying to balance the dangers and difficulties 
brought on by information system interruptions with the goal of maximizing the advantages. 
 
Government organizations should see an improvement in their governance processes as a result of putting this 
research's suggestions into effect. This improvement could show up as more efficient data management, better service 
delivery, and more streamlined decision-making procedures. Adomavicius et al., 2017). to reduce vulnerabilities and 
ensure strict adherence to data protection regulations. (Adner, 2017). 
 
The research's conclusions will serve as the foundation for developing sophisticated data security and privacy 
procedures inside government agencies. These steps are intended to lessen vulnerabilities and guarantee stringent data 
adherence. 
 
Government organizations are poised to leverage the opportunities identified in this research to introduce innovative 
practices and prioritize citizen-centric services. Innovation and Citizen-Centric Services The outcome is a shift toward 
more user-friendly and efficient services aligned with citizen expectations. 
 
The implications arising from this research are expected to inform policymakers and stimulate the development of 
responsive policies and governance frameworks. These policies will be designed to adapt to the ever-evolving nature 
of information system disruptions within government organizations. (Vishwanath & Barnett, 2011). 
 
The international and comparative perspectives embedded in this research are anticipated to facilitate cross-border 
knowledge transfer Cross-Border Knowledge Transfer. This knowledge transfer will enable government organizations 
across different countries to adapt and implement successful strategies for managing information system disruptions, 
leading to improved governance worldwide. 
 
5.2 Validation  
The backdrop against which this research is framed is anchored in the ever-evolving landscape of information 
technology within government organizations. In recent decades, the reliance on information systems has experienced 
exponential growth as governments endeavor to harness technology for enhanced efficiency and transparency. 
However, this rapid integration of technology has concurrently given rise to disruptions, complications, and 
opportunities that warrant comprehensive examination. (Christensen, 2017). 
 
First and foremost, the rapid pace of technological advancement is a central driver of information system disruptions. 
The ceaseless evolution of technology necessitates perpetual adaptation within government organizations. Outdated 
legacy systems frequently necessitate replacement with new implementations, thereby disrupting established 
processes. (Wirtz et al., 2019).

Furthermore, the complexity inherent in government operations contributes to challenges during the integration of 
information systems. This complexity, often characterized by diverse functions encompassing public service delivery, 
security, and defense, can lead to complications that have cascading effects throughout the organization. 
 
In addition, governments now depend more and more on data to make educated decisions. Information system 
disruptions can have a significant influence on the availability and quality of data, which can therefore have an effect 
on how policies are developed and how the public is served (Adner, 2017). 
Furthermore, the need for research on information system disruptions is further highlighted by the rising demands of 
citizens. Nowadays, the public expects government services to be just as effective and convenient as those provided 
by the private sector. It is crucial to consider how information system disturbances can help or hurt these expectations. 
(Tushman & Altman, 2017). 
 
Finally, the study closely follows both national and international developments. These include e-government 
programmers, the expansion of open data, and the digitization of government activities, policies, all of which continue 
to reshape the landscape of government operations. (Berghaus & Back, 2020). 
 
By considering these factors, this research aspires to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disruptions, 
challenges, and opportunities stemming from the use of information systems in government organizations. Its findings 
will offer invaluable insights and recommendations for enhancing the manner in which governments harness 
technology for the mutual benefit of both the organization and its citizens. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The utilization of information systems in government organizations has become pivotal for enhancing efficiency, 
service delivery, and data management. However, these implementations often introduce disruptions in the established 
operational paradigms. These disruptions encompass a wide array of challenges, including but not limited to resistance 
from personnel, technical complexities, data security concerns, and the need for legacy system integration. 
Concurrently, they also yield opportunities for innovation, improved governance, and more citizen-centric services. 
The research problem at the core of this investigation is the necessity to comprehensively understand and address the 
disruptions caused by information system implementations in government organizations. This encompasses the 
intricate challenges that hinder smooth integration and operation of these systems, the inherent risks posed to data 
security and privacy, and the complexities of maintaining effective legacy system integration. At the same time, it 
involves recognizing and harnessing the opportunities emerging from these disruptions to advance government 
operations and services. (Anderson & Tushman, 1990). 
 
In order to ensure the provision of effective, safe, and citizen-centered services, the issue also involves the creation of 
best practices and strategies for government organizations to manage these disruptions, reduce related risks, and 
maximize benefits. Given the swift progress of technology and the changing demands of the public, the research 
problem takes on great importance. By tackling this issue, the research hopes to offer practical suggestions that 
government agencies may use to overcome obstacles and seize chances in order to promote a more adaptable, effective, 
and safe governance structure.

Abstract 
As the world moves towards renewable energy sources, solar energy is becoming more widely recognized. This 
impacts photovoltaic (PV) panel prices, which requires deeper analysis to shape strategic planning. This paper fills a 
gap in PV panel price forecasting by utilizing machine learning models for multivariate time 
series forecasting, offering a more robust, comprehensive, and adaptable approach. Based on literature review, feature 
analysis, and linear regression, PV panel prices factors were identified, and data was collected. The dataset consists 
of 26 monthly time series features covering January 2018 to July 2023. The study's methodology consists of two 
phases: Phase I involves applying machine learning models (CNN, KNN, Random Forest, SVR, XGBoost) to forecast 
prices, resulting in the selection of the Random Forest model as the most effective based on performance metrics and 
comprehensive evaluations. Phase II utilizes the aforementioned model, along with forecasted features from the 
SARIMA model, to predict future PV panel prices. Forecasts indicate a stabilized PV panel market for 36 months 
from July 2023, with slight price fluctuations. This stabilization hypothesis aligns with other research 
findings, suggesting industry agreement. As the solar industry is dynamic, regular market analyses and model 
calibrations are essential.Overall, the research enhances the understanding of solar energy price time series 
forecasting, 
merging 
data 
gaps, 
and 
outlining 
pivotal 
price-influencing factors, 
offering stakeholders direction towards a sustainable energy future. Recommendations include using a broader 
dataset, improving methodology, exploring more models, applying a hybrid model, and continually updating 
forecasting methods in alignment with industry dynamics.

6.2 Final Outcomes 
In conclusion, this paper analyzed and determined factors that influence PV panel prices, through literature review 
and correlation analysis. To refine the data, a feature analysis using linear regression optimized error loss. As a result, 
26 features over 67 months were selected. 
 
Phase I: The study applied five machine learning models: CNN, KNN, Random Forest, SVR, XGBoost for 
multivariate time series forecasting. Each model underwent a detailed evaluation including actual vs. predicted graph 
analysis, various performance metrics (SMAPE, MAPE, MAE, RMSE, MSE, and Huber loss), and residual 
distribution analysis. All models showed impressive performance. Based on the comprehensive analysis 
conducted, Random Forest and XGBoost models emerge from the comparison of actual and predicted 
performance. Among the performance metrics, the Random Forest model performs best, with the lowest SMAPE and 
impressive RMSE, followed closely by the SVR model. Furthermore, residual distribution analysis demonstrates that 
Random Forest can effectively capture underlying patterns without introducing significant bias.While XGBoost, SVR, 
and other models were competitive in certain aspects and had specific strengths, the Random Forest model offers the 
best overall performance across multiple evaluation criteria and is most suitable for the given dataset and forecasting 
requirements due to its balanced performance. 
 
Phase II: Implementing the Random Forest model and integrating forecasted features from the SARIMA model, 
predictions indicate relative price stability in PV panels for the next 36 months starting July 2023. Although there are 
minor fluctuations in the predicted prices, these changes remain within a consistent range, indicating a stabilized 
market. The observation is further supported by comparable findings from an online platform and other research 
institutions, which indicate the industry is in agreement that prices will stabilize. Furthermore, the decline in PV panel 
prices, the narrowing price gap between products of different manufacturing tiers, and the ease of inventory pressures 
all point to a stabilizing market. However, the dynamic nature of the solar industry requires regular market analysis 
and model reassessments. Given that models like Random Forest rely heavily on recent data trends, periodic updates 
with new data are essential.  
 
This study provides insight into the complexities of solar energy time series price forecasting, bridging gaps in data 
and highlighting factors that influence PV panel prices. By integrating tailored machine learning models, the study 
also provides valuable insights for stakeholders, steering them towards a sustainable energy future.  
 
6.3 Recommendations and Future Work 
In this study, 26 features have been analyzed for 67 months, which is a small sample size for time series forecasting. 
Therefore, using a larger dataset will enhance and improve forecasts. In which, instead of monthly data it would be 
more beneficial to use weekly, daily, or hourly datapoints. Data collection was limited due to the few available sites 
that give data for free. Therefore, it is advised to find a company or online source that gives valid data for a 
reasonable price. This will ensure a longer dataset. Also, expanding the study's geographical scope beyond China 
could offer a more comprehensive view of PV panel prices.

Although the five models used showed impressive performance, it would be beneficial to use or explore more machine 
learning models for forecasting multivariate timeseries data. Furthermore, improving the method of evaluation might 
also improve their performance. Consider alternative approaches such as LOOCV (Leave One Out Cross Validation) 
instead of k-fold cross validation and use more evaluation metrics. For future scenarios, it would be valuable to 
investigate the forecasted features further as some features may not be captured accurately by the SARIMA model 
because other factors influence them. In this regard, capturing their performance with another model would enhance 
the data. 
 
Furthermore, when tailoring a statistical or machine learning model for forecasting multivariate timeseries data, a lot 
of factors must be taken into consideration. It would therefore be more accurate and efficient to develop and apply a 
hybrid model that combines both statistical and machine learning characteristics. To conclude, since changes in the 
solar industry are sudden, constant monitoring is necessary to detect any deviations or irregularities. Also, models like 
Random Forest tend to generalize based on the patterns they recognize in the training data. In order to ensure the 
model's predictive accuracy, it should be re-evaluated periodically with updated data.

Abstract 
This paper investigates how the interconnectedness of goods within an ecosystem determines their values 
independently of the price system. While this aspect has roots in old classical economic theory, it has periodically 
been overlooked in the development of consumer theory. It draws inspiration from the assertions by M. Douglas and 
B. Isherwood that nothing possesses inherent value, and focuses on approaches of making correct choices by G.
Gigerenzer, as well as examples drawn from the marketing systems of supermarkets, superstores, hypermarkets, and
mega malls, where a diverse array of products is made available to buyers. The findings of this study suggest that
interconnected goods within an ecosystem establish standards of exchange-values that significantly contribute to
consumer choice.

The significance of intrinsic value in consumer choice is not a new topic in economic theory. This idea was initially 
introduced and developed in classical economic theory, primarily with the objective of determining exchange value. 
However, this concept was not further pursued due to its limitations in supporting the exchange system, and 
consequently was dominated by the price system used as a denominator to determine value of goods. Even if this 
system marked an important development in consumer theory, the present work identified that goods are not neutral, 
they form a system of hierarchical and structured information of values that affect consumer choices.   
 
 
5. Conclusion 
The work investigated how possess inherent intrinsic values and through the assemblage of goods in the market 
system, these values form an ecosystem of hierarchy of values that provide physical and visible statements to which 
affect customer choices. These representations help customers to make choices by using simple mental calculations 
that facilitate to order those complex hierarchy of values. This shows that goods are not neutral in the system of 
consumer choices. This conceptual consideration of goods helps to understand how goods are valuable which can help 
to achieve sustainable consumption.   
 
6. Contribution 
The contribution of this work is as follows:  
• 
This paper helps to understand how goods are interconnected and form an ecosystem that determines values 
that can be referred to determine price system. To understand this process helps the analysis of value 
determination, pricing and choice decisions.   
• 
By understanding the functionality of this ecosystem, provides certainty in the consumer choices.  
• 
It contributes to sustainability development as it helps in attribution of real value to goods.

In response to the question of whether consumer choices exclusively rely on the price system, the data reveals that 
49% of respondents indicated their choices are influenced by the price system. Additionally, 20% strongly use the 
price system as a reference for value, 16% remain neutral, 13% do not make explicit reference to prices, and 2% 
completely ignore prices. These findings suggest that, beyond prices, there exist other criteria that significantly impact 
consumer choices, with one such factor being the intrinsic features of related products (Figure 3).

In response to the question of whether the marketing systems of supermarkets, superstores, hypermarkets, and mega 
malls provide a perception that aids in the mental calculation of product value, the survey results indicate that 37% of 
respondents agree with this statement. On the other hand, 20% disagree, 15% strongly agree, 14% are neutral, and 
14% strongly disagree. There seems to be a correlation with consumers who still strongly believe in the price system; 
however, a growing majority of consumers are recognizing that product networks, through the ecosystem of intrinsic 
values, play an essential role in consumer decisions (Figure 4).

Abstract 
Sustainable development is crucial to the continuity of our communities. The World Commission on Environment and 
Development (WCED) defined Sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the current 
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure highlights the importance of building 
resilient infrastructure, promotion of inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. Airports are 
essential facilities that provide the infrastructure necessary for safe air transportation of people and cargo. In addition, 
airports contribute to the local economies and global economy by providing employment and acting as economic 
drivers to the local communities. As is, there is no one accepted framework for incorporating sustainability projects 
in airport development projects. The sustainable development of airports is key to ensuring continuity of the global 
air transportation system. This study will explore sustainable development practices in African airports including the 
different approaches used by African airports to achieve sustainable development of the airport systems in Africa. The 
researcher will use case studies from various regions in Africa including Airports Company South Africa, Kenya 
Airports Authority, Morocco Airports Authority, and other airport operators to identify best practices on airport 
sustainability. The researcher expects to find that airports in Africa have adopted sustainable airport development 
practices. However, it is likely that these practices are not well documented because there is no one accepted 
framework for incorporating sustainability in airport development projects.

Abstract 
Existing evidence indicates that Free/Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS) ecosystems offer extensive learning 
opportunities. Community members actively participate in various activities, both during their interactions with peers 
and while utilizing these environments. Given that FLOSS repositories contain valuable data on participant 
interactions and activities, our study focuses on analyzing knowledge exchange and interactions within emails to track 
learning activities across different phases of the learning process, with a focus on the first phase (Initiation). In this 
paper, we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques within a process 
mining framework. Specifically, we employ NLP techniques to analyze the contents of emails and messages 
exchanged in these FLOSS repositories to generate event logs for the purpose of modeling learning patterns. 
Subsequently, we construct corresponding event logs, which serve as input to Disco, the process mining tool, for 
learning process discovery in these environments. The output comprises visual workflow nets that we interpret as 
representations of learning activity traces within FLOSS, capturing their sequential occurrences. To enhance the 
understanding of these models, we incorporate additional statistical details for contextualization and description. This 
approach enables a nuanced exploration of learning dynamics within FLOSS environments, emphasizing the role of 
NLP and ML in uncovering valuable insights on how FLOSS participants acquire and exchange knowledge.

Over the past decades, numerous studies conducted have shown evidence that there are substantial learning 
opportunities in Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) environments (Sowe and Stamelos 2008; Cerone et al. 
Fernandes et al. 2014; Mukala et al. 2014; Jaccheri and Osterlie 2007). Some of these environments or platforms that

there has been limited empirical work in this domain. Existing studies have predominantly relied on content data 
gathered through surveys, questionnaires, or reports from community observers with a defined period of involvement. 
Research indicates a growing number of participants actively engaging in these platforms through discussions and 
email exchanges, generating substantial volumes of data that inherently contain evidence of learning. 
 
Since learning activities are not directly observable in the repositories, we expanded upon our prior work on semantic 
search by integrating the advantages offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) through Natural Language Processing 
(NLP). This integration aims not only to confirm the existence of such activities (learning patterns) in these 
environments but also to empirically substantiate their presence through text mining. 
  
By employing a blend of Natural Language Processing models, key phrases, and a set of rules, our approach has not 
only reiterated but expanded upon our prior findings, shedding further light on how to uncover traces of interaction 
and learning activities in Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) email messages. The feasibility of tracing these 
activities has been established, with process mining emerging as a catalytic tool for identifying such activities within 
FLOSS. Our work contributes by offering empirical evidence regarding the existence of learning processes in FLOSS 
environments, as demonstrated through the analysis of OpenStack Mailing Archives. 
 
This paper underscores that, through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing 
(NLP), we can attain results that are notably more accurate and closely aligned with the formalism of learning patterns 
found in the existing literature. Our intention is to extend this research by applying the same approach to the next two 
phases of the learning process and potentially expanding it to other FLOSS environments. This expansion aims to 
uncover main patterns while also identifying potential differences, thereby enhancing our understanding of these 
patterns and providing a robust foundation for knowledge generation. Such insights can significantly contribute to 
shaping policies surrounding the adoption of participation in FLOSS projects, offering a viable alternative for 
imparting practical skills to computer science and programming students.

Abstract 
Major fast fashion companies have recently launched resale platforms for second-hand shopping. Although many 
experts consider these initiatives as a greenwashing strategy, it is unclear whether consumers agree with that or rather 
find such initiatives sustainable. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine consumer attitudes towards the 
sustainability of second-hand fast fashion. Accordingly, Instagram reels and posts related to second-hand fast fashion 
are identified and all comments under those contents are extracted. Next, these comments are analysed with a 
sentiment analysis and a content analysis. Results show that consumers express more positive sentiments towards 
resale companies that ban fast fashion items than towards resale companies that specialize in fast fashion. Comments 
referring to companies banning fast fashion resale show consumers’ predominant support of the ban, while companies 
doing fast fashion resale receive strong criticism on social media. Consumers are specifically concerned about the 
quality of second-hand fast fashion items as well as express social and ethical concerns towards fast-fashion resale. 
The resulting practical implication is that companies should consider discontinuing second-hand fast fashion.

1. Introduction
There was a time when second-hand shopping might only be related to the economic factors of consumers. In recent 
times, second-hand shopping has received a makeover and has been associated with other factors such as 
sustainability, circular economy, and vintage (Daukantienė, 2023). According to a recent study from the online resale 
platform thredUP, (2023), the resale marketplace reached $177 billion in 2022 sales, up 28% over 2021. The report 
also states that Gen Z and Millennials are more interested in sustainability while second-hand shopping. 
Researchers have studied the second-hand fashion trend and its relationship to sustainability as well as to other factors 
like quality, price, trend, etc. (Borusiak et al., 2020; Mohr et al., 2022). Although fast fashion giants like Zara, Shein, 
and Pretty Little Things have introduced their resale platforms to get a piece of this rising resale market share, many 
experts perceive these as a greenwashing strategy of the fast fashion companies to compensate for their negative 
environmental impact (Amatulli et al., 2016; Webb, 2022). 
Fast Fashion refers to ‘inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends’ 
(Oxford English Dictionary, 2023) and researchers have studied fast fashion widely (Amatulli et al., 2016; Yoon et 
al., 2020). However, the fast fashion resale field has not been thoroughly studied yet. Specifically, it remains uncertain 
what the consumers’ perspective on fast fashion resale is regarding sustainability. Investigating consumers’ attitudes 
towards the sustainability of second-hand fast fashion will fill the research gap by analyzing customers’ preferences 
in second-hand shopping and sustainable fashion. Such a study could provide insights into how fast fashion resale can 
be made more sustainable and eco-friendlier to consumers. Thus, it contributes to the literature on sustainable fashion,

sentiments toward social media content about fast fashion resale suggest that consumers comparably view the concept 
regardless of the perspective presented (for or against). 
 
The findings from the CA showed that most consumers’ positive sentiments toward fast fashion resale were not due 
to affordability, but they prefer replacing new purchases with second-hand fast fashion items rather than contributing 
to landfills. Most consumers decide on the sustainability of fast fashion items based on their brands and feel the 
necessity of transparency and awareness in the fashion industry. On the other hand, most negative comments addressed 
fast fashion garments’ cheap quality without resale value, and unethical and non-eco-friendly production. To conclude, 
the main factors influencing consumers’ decisions regarding the sustainability of fast fashion resale were found to be: 
(1) Social and ethical consideration, (2) Environmental sustainability, (3) Quality, and (4) Brand reputation.  
 
This paper has three main limitations. First, a limited number of contents are available related to fast fashion resale 
on Instagram compared to other topics such as sustainable fashion or fast fashion in general, which led to a relatively 
small sample of posts and reels being analysed. However, 1500 comments are a reasonable starting point for sentiment 
analysis on fast fashion resale as they represent a broader population on Instagram. Second, manual annotation 
detected two contexts where some consumers reacted to the content while others reacted to the content creator 
confusing the model, which resulted in some bias in the sentiment categorization. In addition, the model failed to 
determine the true sentiment of some comments due to the presence of negative words or emojis in positive comments 
or vice versa. However, the inaccuracy level was quite low to affect the overall result. Third, although the coding 
scheme generated in this study worked well to interpret most comments, for a few where keywords were absent, it 
performed poorly. In such instances, the underlying contexts were detected after manual annotation.  
 
In the future, using our findings new research can be initiated to further investigate consumers’ second-hand shopping 
habits such as if a purchase of preowned fast fashion items replaces the purchase of a new fast fashion item or not.  A 
large-scale survey with numerous participants from different regions can be conducted to validate our results. 
Furthermore, consumers’ actual shopping behavior and the attitudes shown on social media platforms can also be 
compared by comparing actual sales data for second-hand fast fashion to our findings from this study. 
 
The main practical implication of this study is that the results can be used to stimulate a broader societal transition 
towards conscious consumerism by increasing awareness of the environmental impacts of fast fashion and the role of 
fast fashion resale in mitigating these effects. These insights could reform the marketing strategies of resale platforms 
and the resulting practical implication is that companies should consider discontinuing second-hand fast fashion.

Abstract 
The study evaluates the environmental sustainability of constructing deep-water injection well systems for waste 
management. As the use of these systems is developing in Qatar, there is no research on their impacts from a 
sustainability point of view. The research aims to provide useful insights through a comprehensive life cycle 
assessment of constructing such wells. The analysis examines key construction stages: mobilization, drilling and 
casing, geophysical surveying, well development, wellhead assembly, and data logger installation for ground-term 
monitoring. Each stage is evaluated for its environmental and socio-economic effects. Initial findings show that while 
construction poses some environmental challenges, particularly regarding drilling and material use, the long-term 
environmental and social benefits may outweigh these concerns. The paper sheds light on the environmental 
implications of constructing deep-water injection wells and identifies initial opportunities to enhance their 
sustainability. The findings can serve as an important reference for the future development and sustainable operation 
of these waste management systems.

1. Introduction
The concept of sustainability in the construction industry has become increasingly significant, as evidenced by various 
papers and reports emphasizing the improvement of the environment, economy, and social sustainability - the three 
bottom lines in the industry. The construction industry is known for its substantial environmental impact, consuming 
vast resources, materials, and energy throughout the lifecycle of any project. These impacts include but are not limited 
to, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, high energy use, air and water pollution, deterioration of the ecological 
system, and poor waste management.

6. Conclusion 
This section proposes potential improvements and identifies areas for future research, particularly focusing on the 
environmental benefits of replacing diesel-powered vehicles and heavy equipment with electric alternatives in the 
construction of deep-water injection wells. 
 
Replacement of Diesel Vehicles with Electric Models: We suggest a shift towards electric vehicles for transportation 
and site activities. This change could significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with diesel consumption, as 
highlighted in our LCA results. 
 
Electrification of Heavy Equipment: The adoption of electrically powered drilling rigs, excavators, and other heavy 
machinery is proposed. This shift not only promises a reduction in direct emissions but also aligns with global trends 
towards sustainable construction practices.

Single Objective Functions in Location Routing Problems: A 
Comparative Case Study

Abstract 
This research explores the Location Routing Problem (LRP), a complex NP-hard problem that combines facility 
location and vehicle routing to minimize operational costs. The focus is on a variant of LRP with covering constraints. 
The primary objective is to investigate the impacts of different single-objective functions in LRPs, contrasting the 
traditional approach of minimizing combined opening and transportation costs with objectives prioritizing either the 
minimization of the number of facilities or the total distance. A Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model is developed 
to analyze the effects of these objectives on facility location and routing efficiency. The methodology involves running 
the MIP model under various objective functions and observing the changes in total distance and number of facilities, 
including the use of preemptive goal programming. Results from small and large problem instances reveal that 
focusing on minimizing the number of facilities significantly reduces their count but increases the total travel distance. 
On the other hand, prioritizing distance minimization shows minimal distance reduction but a slight increase in the 
number of facilities compared with the traditional approach of minimizing combined opening and transportation costs, 
but this may be due to the proneness to the scale of data. A Pareto analysis shows the trade-offs between these 
objectives. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the importance of objective selection in LRPs, 
offering valuable insights for decision-makers in adapting LRP strategies to specific operational priorities.

1. Introduction
The location routing problem (LRP) is a complex problem involving two important decision-making processes: 
facility location and vehicle routing. The primary goal of the LRP is to determine the optimal location for facilities, 
e.g. warehouses, and the best routes for vehicles leaving from these facilities to a set of customer/demand points in
order to minimize overall costs, which can include transportation, facility opening, and other operational expenses.
The LRP is a combination of two NP-hard problems, which makes the LRP itself an NP-hard problem, too (Lopes et
al. 2013). Its complexity is due to its combinatorial nature and the interdependencies between location and routing
decisions.
The LRP has a wide array of applications. Some of its traditional applications include healthcare, and 
telecommunications and network design. In healthcare logistics for example, LRP helps in locating medical facilities 
and routing medical supplies and services, ensuring accessibility and efficient distribution of healthcare resources. In 
telecommunications and network design, LRP is helps in determining optimal locations for servers, routers, or relay 
stations, and for efficient data routing. The LRP has seen some recent applications in the sharing economy as well.

Another research direction involves incorporating cost data to examine how the scale of this data impacts the 
performance of the objective functions discussed, particularly objective function (2), which showed minimal variation 
from the baseline case.

Abstract 
3D printing (3DP) is a revolutionary manufacturing method that enables rapid prototyping, customization and local 
production of parts, hence reducing waste of resources. A new paradigm in the supply chain could be then realized by 
capitalizing on 3DP, that is: decentralized manufacturing, characterized by geographic dispersion and enhanced 
resilience to risks and disruptions, while also offering customers numerous benefits, including faster fulfilment of 
personalized orders. However, optimizing the allocation of customer demands is a complex challenge, especially in 
the context of decentralized 3DP shops operating under limited capacity constraints. By optimizing based on delivery 
distance, it is possible to reduce resource consumption and environmental impact while also shortening overall 
delivery time, thereby achieving better realization of the advantages of decentralized 3DP. This research firstly 
addresses the challenge of efficiently allocating customer demand to decentralized 3DP shops, optimizing delivery 
distances while considering capacity constraints by leveraging on mature Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) 
based 3DP optimization techniques and innovative combination with Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, the study 
analyzes quantitatively and qualitatively the superior probability and difference in overall delivery distance between 
decentralized 3DP shops and hypothetical centralized 3DP hubs across various sub-scenarios with massive, 
randomized customer instances in the greater Cairo region in Egypt. Through this research, we aim to gain a 
comprehensive understanding on the advantages of decentralized 3DP on a much broader scale.

compared to the allocation of each customer to the nearest of two hubs, utilizing Monte Carlo simulation to simulate 
real-world variability and disruptions in customer locations and demand size. 
 
Taking into consideration the shortest distances traveled, calculated by the Open-Source Routing Machine (OSRM), 
for a realistic logistics study, this approach incorporates real geographical conditions and the road network in Cairo, 
Egypt. Furthermore, four sub-scenarios are proposed to offer a deeper view and statistical analysis, providing 
information that helps policymakers and stakeholders decide when to use the current network of 3DP in contrast to 
manufacturing in central hubs. Thus, the study enriches the theory and knowledge through this combination of tools 
and its application to the real case of Cairo. 
 
The results, demonstrated through extensive testing and optimal solution, show a significant leaning towards 
decentralized manufacturing in the case of Cairo, hence achieving a substantial reduction in delivery distances. This 
reduction is especially pronounced in scenarios with a large customer base and low individual demand. Only in a very 
small percentage of the cases, where the number of customers is really low but individual demand is quite high 
(ranging between 500 to 1000 hours of demand), resembling an extreme case (for example, cases of supply chain 
disruptions, where the customers are institutions requiring massively produced parts), and while on average it is still 
better to use the 3DP network, stakeholders should take extra care for each individual case, as the tests show the 
decision can flip towards centralized manufacturing the more the number of customer decline and individual demand 
surge. 
 
Our findings also bear significant practical implications, especially for the rapidly flourishing 3DP industry in Egypt. 
With the current state of 3DP facilities and relevant capacities, we expect a future where local manufacturing through 
nearby shops combined with last-mile delivery logistics is very promising. This study also serves as a guide for local 
businesses and policymakers to optimize and utilize, as well as foster the 3DP industry as it contributes to the local 
industry ecosystem and serves as a cushion for supply chain disruptions. Moreover, it contributes to environmental 
sustainability through reduced travel distance and the associated carbon footprint. 
 
However, limitations exist, such as region-specific conclusions, idealized parameters, and insufficient consideration 
of 3DP specific variables and constraints as scheduling tasks, types of 3DP material and technology used. A hybrid 
system could also be devised to shift customers demand allocation to hubs when the 3DP facilities’ capacity is reached, 
altering between two systems. A more nuanced customer demand could thus be modeled as well. We also recommend 
the expansion of the model to include other variables such as carbon footprint, transportation costs, constraining the 
hub’s capacity, and proposing other hub locations.  
 
Finally, we suggest the replicability of our study by capitalizing on alternate algorithms on the same data set from 
Cairo, Egypt. Additionally, apply the established model and analysis parameters to different cities and datasets to 
enhance the findings as well as reaching a more generalized conclusion.

Abstract 
This case study aims to develop a proposal for the future sport coupé (Frizziero et al., 2021) using the IDeS (Frizziero 
et al., 2022) (Industrial Design Structure) method for testing and validation. IDeS method is a blend of innovative and 
advanced systematic approaches used in setting up a new industrial design. The method includes several sequential 
phases: quality function deployment (QFD), benchmarking (BM), top-flop analysis (TFA) and stylistic design 
engineering (SDE). The development of the sports coupé will progress through these phases, guiding the definition of 
technical and stylistic choices essential to compete in the market share. The ultimate goal is to validate the obtained 
result using this innovative methodology. This involves confirming that the product aligns with its segment (S-
segment), meets QFD-defined requirements, outperforms competitors from the BM in TFA, and follows the stylistic 
requirements outlined in the SDE.

1. Introduction
Our exploration into the S-Segment aims to distill key characteristics and design principles, focusing on performance 
attributes. However, the main goal is to use these insights to conceive an innovative next-generation sports coupé 
(Pagliari, 2023). Inspired by both contemporary and classic vehicles (Figure 1), we seek to push the boundaries of 
innovation, reimagining features from seating arrangements to powertrain solutions. This endeavor aspires to 
contribute to the evolution of sports car classification, envisioning a vehicle that embodies performance while 
reflecting the changing landscape of automotive design and technology.

Surface for finer control. This meticulous process takes months to ensure a flawless model. While Blender is used 
for both modeling and rendering, it's illustrative rather than an industry standard. The rendering phase in Blender 
allows for photorealistic renders with virtual environments.  
 
5.6.3 Prototyping 
Utilizing a 3D printer, a scaled model of the car was successfully produced (Figure 17). The model is proportionally 
scaled at 1:20 compared to the actual vehicle and was printed in collaboration with Alma Mater Studiorum of Bologna. 
  
 
6. Conclusion 
The entire project, focused on crafting an innovative sports car for the future, followed the comprehensive IDeS 
method. From first analysis and QFD to benchmarking, sketching, blueprinting, and 3D modeling, each step 
contributed to the final results. The success of this endeavor highlights the efficacy of the IDeS method in 
systematically guiding design decisions for market relevance.

Abstract 
Integration of technology in the agricultural sector in Latin American and Caribbean countries is complex, with the 
Dominican Republic (DR) serving as an exemplary scenario for significant findings. Key areas of study included 
forecasting, mechanization, infrastructure, and energy, emphasizing potential benefits in productivity, sustainability, 
and resilience. This study explores technological interventions in agriculture. A total of nine technology readiness 
levels (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇1−9) were identified, divided into 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇1−3 development stages, 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇4−6 near-real operational stages, and 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿7−9, full scale readiness. Integrated site evaluation of various agricultural practices in collaboration with local 
agriculturist provided data for calculating the binary probability distribution of outcomes 𝑃𝑃(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖), and uncertainty 
(𝑈𝑈) was estimated as a linear model combination of the cumulative distribution function values ൫𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗൯ for each 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖. 
A random deviate (𝑟𝑟) generated from a uniform distribution (0,1) and linear interpolation was used to simulate the 
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 for each technology assessed in this study. Results show that irrigation systems face resistance (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇5), 
hydroponic plantations show promise but lack cost efficiency (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇6), genetically modified crops demonstrate long-
standing acceptance (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇9), while forecasting, mechanization, and artificial intelligence are in early stages of 
adoption (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇2−5). Calculated average 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 for DR = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇4.82, highlighting the potential for agricultural innovation, 
however, underscoring the importance of targeted strategies to overcome barriers. Agricultural technological 
integration alleviates hunger and enhances food security. This encourages autarkic government policies and private 
sector collaboration, fostering efficient, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable agricultural practices in the 
Dominican Republic and across Latin American and Caribbean countries.

specialized crops, the private sector, and large businesses are further along in adopting advanced technologies, while 
other areas like mass-produced staple crops and smaller businesses are at earlier stages of technological integration. 
The green lines connecting to the 'Resources' axis suggest the influence of investment and research on technology 
adoption, highlighting the disparities and potential areas for targeted growth in the sector. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The study presented a comprehensive overview of the current state of agricultural technology in the Dominican 
Republic and Latin America. It emphasized the potential that innovative solutions have, to enhance agricultural 
productivity and resilience. An analysis of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) revealed numerous opportunities 
and challenges, with the Dominican Republic displaying an average TRL of 4.83. 
 
Findings suggest a considerable interest in agricultural technology among farmers, though actual adoption rates differ 
markedly among technologies. Barriers such as high initial costs, the need for specialized knowledge, and the 
inclination towards established farming techniques are predominant. Nonetheless, the gradual implementation of 
technologies, including efficient irrigation systems and advanced agricultural infrastructure, could greatly enhance 
agricultural output. 
 
The importance of technology in propelling the agricultural sector forward in both Latin America and the Dominican 
Republic was a key point of the study. Technological advances can help tackle significant challenges like variable 
weather patterns, pest control, and the efficient use of resources. They also offer a means for Latin American nations 
to enhance their competitiveness on a global scale. 
 
The benefits of adopting new agricultural technologies include improved water management through advanced 
irrigation systems, which can decrease waste and bolster crop vitality. Additionally, mechanization and artificial 
intelligence could improve crop management, cut labor costs, and bolster productivity. The adoption of 
biotechnologies can lead to crops with greater disease resistance, thereby enhancing yields. 
 
The study advocates for more research aimed at overcoming the hurdles to technology adoption within the agricultural 
sector. It calls for investigations into affordable, user-friendly technologies suited to local needs, as well as studies to 
understand farmer attitudes toward new technologies and how to foster their adoption. Furthermore, educational 
initiatives to increase farmer expertise in emerging technologies are seen as crucial for future progress. 
 
In conclusion, technology and innovation are essential to revolutionizing agriculture in Latin America and the 
Dominican Republic. Despite existing challenges, strategic investment, education, and governmental support can lead 
to the widespread implementation of advanced agricultural technologies, marking a new era of robust and efficient 
farming in the region.

Abstract 
This paper aims to articulate observations of a technical organization during corporate restructuring. It conducts a 
systematic literature review to identify factors of drivers, actions, and outcomes within a corporate spin-off, the authors 
then conducted three case studies of spin-offs using those findings using surveys and interviews of real-world 
executives who managed a corporate restructuring spin-off. Additionally, this paper gives further insight into the 
relationships of actions and outcomes of spin-offs, finding that there are correlations between change management, 
systematic change and organizational restructuring to performance, effects on employees, and market fit strategy. 
Engineering managers can use this paper to understand the dynamics within a corporate restructuring and act 
accordingly. Engineering management researchers can use this paper to get further insight into the restructuring 
processes in technical organizations.

1. Introduction
The prevalence of conglomerates is diminishing, as noted by Nolan et al. (2007) and Tubke (2004). Since the 80’s, 
20% to 50% of acquisitions, mergers, and divestitures were spin-offs, primarily to enhance strategic and organizational 
performance of the parent firm (Bergh, 2007; Moncada, 1999; Lumer, 2022). Organizations are increasingly opting 
to divest and specialize to enhance investment appeal (Kengelbach et al., 2014; Bergh et al., 2008; Tubke, 2004). 
Divestitures occur in various forms: Spin-offs, Sell-offs, and Carve-outs; this paper concentrates on corporate 
restructuring spin-offs. In this variation of spin-offs, assets are transferred to a new entity or separate corporation. 
Examples include historically dominant conglomerates, General Electric, Siemens, and Mitsubishi. These companies 
were especially dominant in the power generation sector, however, spun off their energy businesses into independent 
entities. This shift is partly driven by performance and market concerns, as traditional fossil fuel-based power 
generation faces scrutiny, prompting a move towards greener, decarbonized alternatives. The complexity of this 
transition involves multiple angles, including managerial influence based on decisions and desired outcomes, 
technology integration, and the scale of change, which is often unfamiliar to many organizations (Ajmal and Koskinen, 
2008; Love et al. (2005). This change, in the form of a corporate restructuring spin-off, poses significant challenges

management also played a role here in facilitating these improvements. Finally, the research highlighted several 
correlations between various management actions and outcomes. Change management showed a strong positive 
correlation with the effect on employees and a positive correlation with market fit strategy. Systematic change was 
positively correlated with effects on employees and performance and with market fit strategy. Organizational 
restructuring was positively correlated to effects on employees and had a strong positive correlation with market fit 
strategy. These correlations demonstrate the importance of management actions in achieving desired outcomes in 
corporate restructuring spin-offs. The focus on organization strategy, enhancing the market footprint, accelerating 
innovation, improving organization effectiveness, and strengthening collaboration, along with agile resource 
allocation, were all key to success of these spin-offs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper analyzed the literature on corporate restructuring spin-offs to identify the constructs, factors, and variables. 
The findings provided in-depth analysis of the wide range of factors in the literature and showed the diversity of the 
topics involved, while. revealing that there were three main constructs, and forty-two factors/variables. These factors 
were then used to evaluate relationships between organizational restructuring, systematic change, change 
management, performance outcome, effects on employees and market fit strategy. Furthermore, this paper provides 
deeper insights to change methods and organizational restructuring. Through three case studies using surveys and 
interviews it was found that there are relationships between change management to effect on employees and market 
fit strategy, systematic change to performance, effect on employees and market fit strategy, and organizational 
restructuring to effect on employees and market fit strategy. This provides further insight into academics and practical 
applications. From an academic viewpoint, it can function as a good foundation for direction of future research in 
enhancing understanding of corporate restructuring spin-offs. From a practical viewpoint, it provides direct insight 
into how engineering managers can focus their efforts to influence performance, effect on employees, and market fit 
strategy. For further research there is still a large amount of knowledge that requires more exploration. Given the 
complexity and multidisciplinary nature of spin-offs, it is important to continue advancing our understanding of how 
a range of factors interrelate and influence each other. Integrating and analyzing more factors across different research 
areas to understand their interrelationships will be critical to enhance the success and competitiveness of spin-offs. 
Future research should focus on the relationships between drivers and their actions and incorporate content analysis 
of document reviews to gain deep insights into the decision-making processes of corporate spin-offs. This will enable 
engineering managers to make more informed decisions and lead to more success.

Abstract 
The evolving nature of organizations often necessitates a re-evaluation of Project Management Office (PMO) models 
to align with their strategic goals. Pertamina, a prominent state-owned Oil & Gas Company, recently underwent a 
significant transformation into a holding-subholding structure. This restructuring has led to the dispersion of over 
2000 investment projects, collectively allocating an annual budget of 9-10 billion USD across six distinct subholdings. 
The Pertamina PMO holds a pivotal role, serving as a linchpin for project management practices within this complex 
organizational framework. This paper explores the parent company's establishment of a centralized PMO service to 
strengthen project management procedures among its subsidiaries. The primary objective of this paper is to portray a 
customized PMO model that is precisely fitted to Pertamina's needs, taking into account operational boundaries, 
stakeholder aspirations, the sheer number of projects, and the unique features of the company's parent and subsidiary 
structure. This paper examines the procedural and technological requirements of implementing these tailored PMO 
models, highlighting challenges, presenting opportunities for improvement, and offering valuable insights into the 
efficient management of the diverse range of projects in Pertamina's portfolio. In essence, this study offers a nuanced 
understanding of the dynamic interplay between a parent company's strategic vision, the subsidiary framework, and 
the services provided by Pertamina PMO which defined the customized PMO model in optimizing project 
management practices. The findings contribute to the academic discourse on organizational restructuring and offer 
practical insights for companies navigating similar complex structures in the ever-evolving global business landscape.

Pertamina Gas (Fourth SH - Senibal Pipeline Project). The SH is involved in the Senibal Pipeline project, 
providing necessary support for the installation of pipelines. This support is integral to ensuring the seamless 
delivery of additional refinery results to the storage facility. 
 
The collaborative efforts of all four Sub-Holdings are essential for the successful execution of the project, leading to 
an increase in revenue. Each Sub-Holding's role is interdependent, and their collective contribution is necessary to 
achieve the project's deliverables and trigger the desired revenue increase. This interconnected approach highlights 
the importance of coordination and collaboration among various entities within the Pertamina organization to 
accomplish complex and interrelated projects. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The purpose of this study is to examine the best practice of PMO benchmark for Pertamina SOE entities for big 
investment value and high number of projects. The benchmarking activities extracted from the literature studies, 
practical PMO guideline, and stakeholder interview. The most applicable benchmark extracted from 17 services that 
accommodated in 4 pillars implementation: Strategic Planning and Portfolio, Project Management & Methodology, 
Project & Program Execution Office, and Learning & Development. Within this 4 pillars implementation, ABI % 
increase from 67,2% (2022) to 88,8% (2023) in correlation of physical project enhancement from -6,9% (2022) into -
0.8% (2023). Survey result also show 4,26/5 scores for PMO Mix of Services that covered activities such as Conduct 
Benchmarking, Portfolio Review, SIIP as Center of Competence, Standardization Good Practice PM, PMO Clinic, 
and PMO Academy. 
 
Additional research and in-depth studies can be pursued to enhance understanding of PMO implementations across 
various State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) entities. This exploration aims to analyze how the adjusted PMO services 
behave in different organizational contexts. Future evaluations may consider alternative perspectives to assess how 
digitalization influences the effectiveness of PMO implementation in achieving stakeholder objectives. 
 
Furthermore, it is imperative to acknowledge that the private sector, characterized by distinct organizational structures 
and cultures, may present unique challenges in implementing the PMO Services benchmarking process. These 
challenges pose considerations for the development of PMO pillars and their strategic services within this sector. 
 
In essence, broadening our research scope to encompass diverse SOE entities and private sector dynamics provides a 
comprehensive perspective, facilitating a nuanced understanding of PMO implementations and their success factors. 
This approach enables us to adapt and refine PMO strategies based on the specific contextual nuances of different

Abstract 
Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize 
manufacturing through the production of complex, high-value components with unprecedented design freedom. 
However, the adoption of MAM is challenging due to its complex and multifaceted nature, which encompasses a wide 
range of advanced technologies, including Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), Direct Energy Deposition (DED), and 
Binder Jetting (BJ).  To address this challenge, this research delves into a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 𝑛𝑛=
71 publications and expands upon a prominent existing MAM readiness model as theoretically proposed by the 
research literature.  This enriched model offers a nuanced understanding of MAM readiness, catering to the intricacies 
of this rapidly evolving field.  Notably, it provides a more fine-grained assessment of competency levels, enabling 
better strategic planning and resource allocation.  The research also highlights the implications of these findings for 
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) operating in the realm of MAM, suggesting avenues for SMEs to 
enhance their competitiveness.  The expanded MAM readiness model seeks to serve as a comprehensive and up-to-
date tool for assessing an organization's readiness to adopt MAM technology.  It is particularly valuable for SMEs, 
which may lack the resources and expertise to independently assess their MAM readiness.  Furthermore, this research 
may be used to support SMEs in navigating their material, data, and personnel interface with Large System Integrators 
(LSIs).

In essence, the journey through MAM readiness assessment is one of comprehensive understanding, meticulous 
analysis, and strategic insight.  It is a testament to the significance of MAM as a transformative technology, and the 
importance of readiness models to guide organizations (Sharretts 2020), particularly SMEs, in their pursuit of MAM 
adoption. This research contributes to the evolution of readiness models and, by extension, to advancement of MAM 
adoption, positioning organizations to thrive in the dynamic and competitive landscape of advanced manufacturing.

Abstract 
Lead times in the design and implementation of spaces in Lima represent 42% of the causes of customer dissatisfaction 
in the sales process. Therefore, the research focuses on the optimization of lead times, as they are usually very high in 
small companies (SMEs) and with non-standardized and therefore inefficient processes. A model is proposed that 
delineates a standardization plan for a process. Initially, it is necessary to map the existing state of sales process, 
recommend a new mapping of the quotation process using Value Stream Mapping (VSM), locate the critical path 
using Pert-CPM, and identify the activity that is causing the greatest amount of process delay. To make the process of 
identifying standards simpler, data is then gathered and categorized. After standardizing the sales procedure and 
validating the proposal with Arena Simulator, the outcomes are assessed. A 20.26% reduction was obtained with 
respect to the total time of the sales process of the initial model. Then, through the collection of non-consolidated data, 
it was possible to create a database with standardized items to make customer service more efficient completing two 
more projects in the same amount of time and reducing 6.26 days the average time of each project.The standardization 
of the sales process in the case study allows them to optimize and standardize it through a proposed model based on 
Lean tools. Furthermore, small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) could adopt and adapt the application of Lean 
service tools to identify their most inefficient processes.

1. Introduction
Lima is the capital of Peru and one of the most important cities in South America, it is also known for being a 
cosmopolitan and modern city, with a wide range of services and activities of public interest. One of the sectors that 
has grown the most in recent years is interior design. In fact, during 2023, this industry had an increase of 131.20 
billion dollars because after the Covid-19 pandemic, people have changed drastically, and new trends and fashions 
were created (El Comercio, 2023). Currently, placing customer experience at the heart of service design has become 
a guiding principle of the current 'experience economy' (Li et al. 2022). This means that having good customer service 
is, ultimately, an important element for improving the performance of a company or organization. It is one of the main 
pain points, especially for businesses offering services as a product (Nagi and Altarazi 2017), where response capacity 
and the customer's experience when receiving the service can be crucial for business growth (Croft and Kovach 2012).

Figure 8. Arena Simulation Model  
 
The model was run with 50 iteration over the course of a calendar year, giving us a sizable sample for outcomes that 
are more in line with reality. The Output Analyzer tool in Arena was used after simulations comparing the current 
model to the improved model. The behavior of the TOTAL TIME variable for both the current and the suggested 
processes as they are run through the Output Analyzer is shown in the image below on Figure 9. 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Output Analyzer 
 
With the help of this tool, it was possible to measure a variable's behavior over the course of the entire procedure with 
a 95% confidence interval. The total sales process time was the chosen variable, and the improvement showed a 
reduction of 6.3 days, or 20.25%, in the total process time. 
 
Regarding the authors that served as reference for the study, some points were found that coincide with the conclusions 
of other studies. The project is specifically based on research on companies in the service sector that use process 
simulation to reduce processing times. According to Kusrini et al. (2019), there was a 16.25% decrease in uptime, i.e., 
136.36 minutes less. Hidayati et al. (2019) have conducted a relevant study suggesting a new business process that 
decreases the number of activities from 21 to 14 and processing time from 8 to 4 days. Their findings show a staggering 
50% decrease in total processing time. In comparison, our study shows a 20.26% reduction. 
 
The overlap between these investigations and ours reveals shared themes in the quest for process optimization in the 
service sector. Although each study takes a different approach, together they highlight the importance of streamlining 
tasks and shortening processing times. Based on these observations, our study contributes to a 20.26% reduction in 
process duration.  Respect to the limitations that might emerge during the use of the suggested approach, staff members 
are needed for the duties of collecting and analyzing data as well as creating different standardization 
recommendations for the business. Employees must also receive training in order to guarantee teamwork and 
adherence to particular policies intended to achieve process uniformity, which is also known as a work philosophy.

The process of developing standardized processes becomes much more difficult in the absence of this practical 
approach. Finally, by focusing on a relatively new service in the area, the current research significantly advances the 
field. The proposed methodology is relevant due to the limited availability of information about this particular service. 
Depending on the intended focus, businesses in different industries or within the same industry can use this 
methodology. In terms of the outcomes attained, they provide insightful information on the present difficulties 
encountered by the industry, suggesting significant importance for industry decision-making and ongoing 
development. 
 
6. Conclusion  
After the research work, it can be concluded that the engineering tools, in order to be used correctly, must follow a 
methodology, so that better results can be obtained in their use. In the case of the present research, the flow diagram 
of the sales process was elaborated to determine how the process was structured and to proceed to the analysis, then 
information was collected on the times and the Value Stream Mapping was assembled to identify the main problems 
of the sales process. Then, the quotation process with suppliers was deepened and the sub-processes of this process 
were identified to find the critical path with PERT-CPM, and then find the bottleneck. The problem was attacked by 
standardizing the process through the creation of a furniture quotation database. It should be noted that this required 
the identification of repeating patterns in the database, the grouping of this furniture and thus the standardization plan. 
Finally, with the improvement proposal finalized, we proceeded to perform a simulation of the sales process in Arena, 
where a reduction of 20.26% in the total average time of the sales process would be achieved. This shows that by 
using the engineering tools in the right way, results can be obtained, giving an important value to the research. 
 
In this research it was found that the main delay in the sales process was in the quotation with suppliers, being more 
specific the quotation of furniture, and it can be concluded that the standardization of processes is key to optimize 
times, especially in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the service sector that generally do not have standardized 
processes. In the service sector, standardization makes it possible to optimize the sales process by guaranteeing quality 
and consistency in the provision of services, in this case ensuring that delivery times are shorter, thus achieving a 
faster sales opportunity and freeing up resources to prioritize other tasks. It is concluded then that with the application 
of these lean tools, in the sales process of a company in the service sector, it will be possible to easily identify which 
is the deficient process, then provide a proposal for improvement to the observed problem, and finally implement this 
solution to optimize the process. In this way, it will be possible to generate greater profitability, reduce costs or increase 
the company's profits.

Abstract 
The trucking industry plays a vital role in the supply chain, GHG emissions, and the national economy. In recent years, 
due to a significant deficiency in freight forwarding, Digital Freight Matching (DFM) models have emerged. These 
models utilize information technology tools and advanced data analytics techniques to address the problems of the 
traditional approach. Recently, various DFM business models have been proposed, each with different characteristics. 
A review of the existing literature reveals a gap in studies examining these business models. In this regard, the present 
study not only critically reviews the evolution of freight forwarding but also comprehensively analyzes various DFM 
business models in terms of operational process, revenue, customer relationship, and digitalization. Moreover, it 
addresses critical questions about the advantages and disadvantages of traditional Freight Brokers and DFM models 
and their impact on the industry. Finally, the study results offer insightful suggestions, serving as a guide for startup 
companies looking to choose an appropriate business model. In addition, the result indicates that there is not a 
universal business model that fits all companies aiming to venture into DFM.

1 . Introduction 
The trucking industry plays an important role in both macroeconomics and microeconomics. In 2020, trucks 
transported more than half of Canada's $384 billion exports to the U.S. and nearly three-quarters of its $264 billion 
imports from the U.S. (Fan & Heminthavonf, 2022). Historically, the industry has depended on traditional processes, 
heavily using intermediaries like Freight Brokers to link shippers with carriers (Van Duin et al., 2019; Huang et al., 
2019). While freight forwarding has been pivotal in this sector, literature reviews highlight significant challenges in 
the trucking industry due to this manual approach, such as empty mileage, extended waiting times for shippers and 
carriers, and cost inefficiencies. In the past decade, the emergence of new information technology tools has empowered

models concerning their operational processes, revenue generation strategies, customer relationships, and 
digitalization levels. 
 
The comparative case study conducted in this research shed light on the distinctions within various DFM business 
models, offering valuable insights for both existing industry players and newcomers. The framework developed in 
this study provides a practical tool for assessing and understanding the different approaches within the trucking 
industry. 
 
As demonstrated in the analysis, successful companies in the industry employ different models, each customized to 
their unique needs. The choice of a business model should be informed by factors such as a company's technological 
capabilities, transportation expertise, carrier relationships, and technological infrastructure. It's worth noting that 
companies can also opt for hybrid models that combine elements from various business models to better align with 
their goals.  
 
Limitations in this study include the analysis of established industry players, possibly overlooking smaller startups or 
regional companies, which can offer unique insights. Furthermore, the study primarily focuses on internal factors 
influencing DFM model selection, and there is limited exploration of external factors such as, economic conditions, 
and competitive landscapes that can significantly impact the industry. Future research should aim to encompass a 
more comprehensive sample of participants and consider a broader spectrum of companies, while also examining the 
influence of external factors on the digital freight matching landscape. Additionally, further research into the impact 
of DFM models on environmental sustainability, including carbon footprint reduction strategies, will be crucial as the 
industry faces growing concerns regarding its ecological impact. Evaluating eco-friendly initiatives and their impact 
on operational efficiency could be a focus area. 
 
In conclusion, this study serves as a valuable resource for startups and industry professionals in the rapidly evolving 
DFM sector, it is essential to have a robust understanding of the practical insight of the various business models and 
their implications to select the most suitable business model, emphasizing adaptability, and tailoring to a company's 
strengths and goals. Our research aims to foster continued growth and innovation in the trucking industry, ultimately 
enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving service quality for all stakeholders.

A Hybrid Approach to Prescribe a Dynamic Operational 
Location for Stationing a Delivery Truck of LPG Cylinder 
for Efficient Last Mile Delivery 
Prithvirajan D and Mathirajan M 
Department of Management Studies

Bangalore 560012, India 
Abstract 
Last Mile Delivery (LMD) relates to all product delivery activities to the end customer in the supply chain. Timely 
delivery of products to customers is one of the primary objectives of businesses rendering LMD services. LPG cylinder 
distribution in India is one such business that provides LMD to its subscribed customers through delivery agents 
employed by distributors. As per the existing system, the cylinders are brought to the office premises from the 
warehouse using Delivery Trucks (DT) and are delivered to customers using small delivery vehicles (SDV). The orders 
delivered each day by the SDV exceed their stock holding capacity. So, SDV must reach the office location from the 
last delivered customer’s location to restock. This current practice of restocking increases the overall distance travelled 
by SDV and increases. Further, this increases the delivery lead time, which directly affects customer satisfaction. To 
overcome these logistics issues in the existing system, this study proposes a dynamic operational location (DOL) for 
stationing each DT around the area, where the delivery is going to happen each day, considering the customers ordering 
pattern, instead of all the DT stationed at the office premise. To prescribe DOL for stationing each of the DT this study 
proposes a hybrid approach and does efficient LMD of LPG cylinders. The proposed hybrid approach involves a multi-
step process. In the first step, a forecasting model is developed to analyze the customer’s order interval pattern and 
predict their next ordering date range (i.e., the next order interval). Customers whose next ordering date range is within 
the next ten days from the decision-making epoch/date are segregated and clustered in the second step. The total 
number of clusters equals the total number of DT operated. In the final step, the centroid location of the generated 
cluster is prescribed as the DOL to station a DT. Based on the proposed DOL for each DT, the SDV will stock the 
cylinders from the DT and proceed for LMD. The proposed hybrid approach is demonstrated using real-life data from 
a large-scale LPG cylinder distributor in a metro city in Tamilnadu. Accordingly, the dataset used for this study has 
the customer’s unique consumer numbers, geocoded addresses, and order placement dates for the past five years. 
Using data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques, the ordering intervals for each customer are obtained, 
and a forecasting model is developed to predict the next order interval for each customer. Customers’ geolocations 
with predicted ordering date range within the next ten days are clustered using the K-Means clustering algorithm, and 
their centroid location is prescribed as DOL for each DT. Finally, both existing practice and the proposed hybrid 
approach for LMD are compared in terms of the distance travelled by an SDV in the current system with the proposed 
system.

to and from the farthest customer’s location missed by the forecasting model to the nearest DOL has been reduced by 
16.7 km and 27.1 km, respectively. The relative reduction in distance travelled by an SDV from the nearest DOL is 
given by, 
Distance Reduced(%) = (Distance to or from Ofϐice Location –  Distance to or from Nearest DOL)
Distance to or from Ofϐice Location
  
The comparison of distance travelled by an SDV to the farthest customer in the current practice and the proposed 
system are computed and tabulated in Table 1.  
Important note: The DT will be stationed at the prescribed DOL as per the proposed system or near the prescribed 
DOL if there is any public disturbances due to parking the DT at the prescribed OL and this decision will be made 
dynamically by the deliveryman operating the DT.

5. Conclusion 
This study has proposed a hybrid approach to prescribe the DOL for temporarily stationing the DT every day in the 
LMD of LPG cylinders. The hybrid approach has a machine learning-based forecasting model developed using the 
RFR algorithm, and a clustering model developed using the K-Means clustering algorithm. A data augmentation 
process called the sliding window technique was used to train the RFR forecasting model with the available small 
dataset. The forecasted order interval was adjusted with the model’s MAE to determine the ordering date range for 
each customer. The customers whose ordering date range falls within the next ten days from the decision-making date 
were segregated and clustered. The centroid location of each cluster was prescribed as DOL for each DT. The distance 
travelled by an SDV from the DOL prescribed by the proposed system was identified to be less than the distance 
travelled in current practice. The comparative study on various forecasting models like Exponential Smoothening, 
ARIMA model, and other regression-based machine learning models like the Regularised Linear Regression model, 
Support Vector Machine Regressor, and Multi Layer Perceptron are yet to be analyzed and is under progress of the 
research agenda towards the thesis/dissertation work of the first author of this study.

Abstract 
 In 2010, a survey analyzing Psychosocial Risks (PSR) among healthcare workers identified the staff of an 
specialized establishment the most passive with the least margin of room for maneuver and a high state of 
satisfaction. The study revealed dysfunctions linked to working conditions and architecture. After improvement of 
working conditions, a reassessment of RPS was obvious. Improving the health of Health Care Workers (HCWs) 
through the promotion of well-being at work. Assess the mental health state of HCWs through the analysis of 
psychosocial risk (PSR) of both populations. - identify differences in the scores of different dimensions. A 
longitudinal, descriptive and analytical study (t0: 2010 and t1: 2016) covering the staff of the establishment using 
three questionnaires to assess PSR. A univariate descriptive and bivariate analysis is used. Increase in the number of 
active people at the expense of liabilities (45.7% - 13% VS 5 % - 70%); increase in decisional latitude (61 VS 65) 
and in Professional harassment from 5% to 13%. Social support dropped by 2 points, efforts decreased from 11 to 8 
and rewards from 19 to 14 and work related satisfaction from 50% to 24% were so in 2016. Action on working 
conditions must be thought of in a consultative and participatory framework with all professional categories.

Abstract 
In this article, we consider a 2-unit cold standby system subject to failure and repair in a multi-level environment.  
At time t = 0, both units are operable and one unit is put into a channel and the other unit is kept as cold standby.  
The channel does the assignment job and takes a random time to make an assignment to the operable unit to 
operate in online with a positive probability.  The failure time of the online unit has exponential distribution 
depending on the level of the multi-level environment.  We assume that the environment is in any one of the N 
levels.  When the environment is in level k, the assignment probability is qk such that  ∑
𝑞𝑞𝑘𝑘
𝑁𝑁
𝑘𝑘=1
= 1          and the 
failure time of the operating unit has exponential distribution with mean     
1
𝜆𝜆𝑘𝑘, 𝑘𝑘= 1,2, ⋯, 𝑁𝑁.  There is a single 
repair facility which is independent of the environment.  Upon failure of the online unit, the standby unit is 
switched online and the failed unit is immediately taken for repair.  The repair commences instantaneously and 
the repair time has an exponential distribution with mean  
1
𝛾𝛾   .  The switch over time is instantaneous and the 
switch is perfect.  There is a possibility that both units may be together in the repair facility at some point of time 
and the repair is done on first-come-first-served basis.  After each repair, the unit is as new as it was before. 
Immediately after completion of the repair of a failed unit, it is sent to the cold standby position and the whole 
process repeats again.  For the model, we perform the reliability and availability analysis.  We also study the 
estimation analysis of the availability in the steady state.

Abstract 
There have been prior efforts characterizing hemp fiber reinforced composites but not hemp stem reinforced 
composites.  Here, we investigate preparation of hemp stem reinforced concrete specimens for analysis and testing. 
To align the hemp stems in a specific direction, we have devised a method using a plastic u-tube to hold the hemp 
stems materials in place.  Without the u-tube, hemp stems can shift from their desired positions while pouring the 
concrete.  Stems were arranged in a 0 and 0/90/0 orientations.  A representative bunch of stems and their cross sections 
are provided.  Based upon micromechanical models of predicting effective properties of stems, we have aligned and 
used NDSANDS module of ASCA.  Effective properties of five representative stem volume elements are calculated 
using constituent properties.  A set of hemp stem reinforced concrete composite specimens are prepared and presented 
towards conducting flexure tests and relevant analysis.

1. Introduction
Commercial hemp production was revived in the United State in 2018 (Schluttenhofer and Yuan, 2018).  Hemp can 
be grown for its fiber, grain, or chemical constituents.  Initially, United States hemp production focused on non-
intoxicating cannabinoids, but recently grain and fiber production and products have gained interest.  Hemp stalks are 
comprised of fiber and hurd (Phipps and Schluttenhofer, 2022).  In a cross-section of a stalk, the fibers are located 
towards the outer portion right underneath the epidermal layer.  Below the fiber is a thick layer of hurd, which has a 
woody composition, but is softer and spongier.  The interior of fiber-type hemp plant is typically hollow (Figures 1-
3). 
Actual hemp stem cross sections are shown in Figure 1. Stems comprise of the epidermal, fiber and hurd layers, with 
stalk having a hollow center. A representative cross-section of hemp stalk is shown in Figure 2.  Figure 3 is a 
representative volume element for math-modeling to calculate the effective properties of the stem.  Using NDSANDS

To avoid this type of difficulties in aligning the stems, we have developed an improved fixture given in Figure 11.  
This helps us preparing specimen of desired dimensions.

Using the frame in Figure 12, we have prepared 12 specimens.  We will do the modeling and testing of all these 
specimens.  We have prepared a combination of specimens to study the effects of hemp stem reinforcements on 
effective response characteristics of concrete composites.  We use these composite combinations to identify additional 
laminate formats and potential product applications.  It is expected that the hemp stems are potentially excellent option 
for creating hemp stalk reinforced concrete composites. 
 
5. Concluding Remarks 
We used mathematical models to analyze effective properties of hemp stems.  A frame for casting specimens was 
created and subsequently modified. A number of hemp stem reinforced panels and specimens are prepared. This work 
provides a route for preparation of samples for testing and analysis of specimens for innovative products.

Abstract 
The twin principles of phase development and fragmentation, as execution models, have made a significant impact on 
effective infrastructure delivery. However, recent experience seems to negate these assertions. Therefore, this research 
aims to evaluate how these two principles were used in the execution of two identical road projects, named Project A 
and Project B, and the impact of the following four factors on their execution, namely, the practice of phase 
development and fragmentation, contractor selection, project planning and management as well as the project funding 
system. The principles of ‘Content Analysis Study’, a qualitative research strategy, were adopted as the research 
method. The findings revealed that Project A was successful in the factors evaluated and the chosen phase was 
completed within schedule. In contrast, Project B failed. This project initiated in 2006 was still a work in progress in 
2023. The conclusion is that the purposive use of the principles and practice of phase development and fragmentation 
can facilitate effective project delivery.

1. Introduction
Developing infrastructure projects in phases is a practice as old as infrastructure development itself. It means taking a 
portion of the entire planned project for execution within a limited time frame. This tool has been used successfully 
to manage short-, medium and long-term infrastructure development plans, allowing steady progression in 
infrastructure development over time, according to priority and purposeful resource allocation (Graumann 2010). 
However, in recent years, although this age-long principle is still being used, it has left in its trail many unsavoury 
results, thus, increasing the incidence of delays, abandoned projects and infrastructure deficits (Ogbeifun et al. 2022). 
The failures being experienced in the use of this tool could be attributable to deficiencies in planning, promoting 
political correctness instead of pursuing a developmental programme, defective execution models, poor resource 
allocation and lack of continuity in governance. To ameliorate these deficiencies, it is reasonable to integrate the 
concept of fragmentation into the execution mode of the chosen phase. This concept suggests that the chosen phase 
should be contextually sub-divided into several lots or work packages of related components, functional sections,

practical approaches could help to ameliorate the incessant cases of failure and abandonment of public sector civil 
engineering projects. They are: Appropriate legislation that would guarantee the continuity of governance, compelling 
succeeding administrations to continue the on-going civil engineering projects, at the original site, irrespective of who 
is concerned when power changes hand from one political party or person to another. Secondly, honouring of payment 
certificates of completed works, as and when due to enhance contractors cash flow and ensure regular progress of the 
work with little or no delay (Ubani and Ononuju, 2013). Thirdly, adopt the practice of phase development and 
fragmentation, according to the available funds (Ogbeifun and Pretorius 2022a). 
 
The amount that can be drawn from the project funds periodically, depends on the production of the contractor(s), as 
reflected in the project’s certificates. Furthermore, adopting the multiple contractor concept holds the potential of 
increased production and effective use of project funds, compared to the single contractor concept (Weidemann 2010; 
Olubomehin, 2015). As demonstrated in this research, Project A was completed within the scheduled time and cost 
limit, thus enabling the client to achieve VFM. On the contrary, Project B is still a work in progress, requiring 
continuous bailout funds.  
   
6. Conclusion  
The focus of this paper was to explore how the integration of the concept of phase development and fragmentation 
into the planning and execution of infrastructure projects impacts on the effectiveness of project delivery. Four 
common factors were evaluated in the execution of two identical road projects, one in South Africa and the other in 
Nigeria. The factors evaluated are the practice of phase development and fragmentation, contractor selection, project 
planning and management as well as the project funding system. The case study strategy of qualitative research was 
adopted, using the instrument of content analysis study to unearth the information in the projects’ archives. The 
synthesis of the information gathered enabled the researchers to understand the successes and challenges of the project 
and develop suitable themes for discussion. The research revealed that Project A was successful because the project 
planners and sponsors adopted the practice of ‘contextual’ phase development. The chosen phase was commensurate 
to the available funds; fragmented into smaller work packages, engaged suitably qualified contractors and an effective 
project management team. Project A was completed within schedule and at a reasonable cost. In contrast, the failures 
of Project B are the glaring lack of adequate planning, poorly defined phases, use of a single contractor, poor quality 
of work, low financial resources and a lack of continuity of governance. 
 
In a nutshell, when the principle and practice of purposive phase development and fragmentation is adopted in the 
development of capital infrastructure, it facilitates the use of quality multiple contractors, and the different components 
of the work are executed seamlessly and strategically coordinated, to achieve the objectives of the project. The result 
obtained using this concept in the execution of Project A is like the results obtained in an earlier research effort by

In conclusion, this research clearly shows that adopting the principles and practice of purposive phase development 
and fragmentation facilitates effective infrastructure delivery. Therefore, this research recommends that the concept 
of purposive phase and fragmentation should be adopted in the planning and execution of all infrastructure types.

Abstract 
Agility is a major concern for enterprises across manufacturing and service sectors. This paper supports the claim that 
process-oriented approaches are useful for agility improvement projects. It builds on an existing process-oriented 
framework for agility improvement projects to identify agility enabling principles and tools in manufacturing. 
Collectively, the framework processes, enabling principles and tools contribute the operationalization of agility 
improvement initiatives. Surveyed practitioners’ confirm this general finding as well as the relevance of the framework 
to middle management, in particular in Small-and-Medium Sized enterprises.  
Keywords 
Processes, agility, manufacturing, projects, improvement. 
1. Introduction
Agility as a concept has been examined in various contexts, including business, enterprise, organizational structure, 
workforce, information technology, manufacturing, supply chains, and software development (Llamas et al., 2016). It 
is considered the main strategy for organizations to compete successfully in an unpredictable and constantly changing 
market (Tseng and Lin, 2011). In manufacturing, agility involves the development of tools and processes designed to 
empower organizations with the capability to rapidly adapt to consumer demands and evolving market conditions, 
while maintaining consistent oversight of quality and operational requirements (Sharma et al., 2022). Agile 
manufacturing is a strategic approach, supported by four core principles: enhancing customer value with unique 
products offered at mass production costs, structuring operations to excel amid change by competing across various 
domains with adaptable resources, fostering cooperation both within and between enterprises, and capitalizing on 
organizational knowledge through cutting-edge technology. Given the rise in market volatility, companies are 
encouraged to adopt agile manufacturing practices. However, it is difficult for an enterprise to achieve agility due to 
the lack of an efficient approach for agile development planning (Tseng and Lin, 2011). 
The process approach, as explored in (Lahlou et al., 2023), is defined as a key strategy for enhancing operational agility 
in manufacturing, focusing on process modeling, performance measurement, and the integration of advanced 
information systems. It has shown success in improving efficiency, reducing cost, as well as enhancing customer

Generally, the rates are slightly higher in the case of SMEs than in large companies, which may reflect possible 
adequacy of the processes and enabling principles and tools to this category. Another possible explanation could be 
related to well established procedures and lack of flexibility in large companies making it difficult to adapt to new 
methods. As a matter of fact, in Figure 4, the leaf node on the left hand side of the decision tree about complementarity 
with existing tools shows the lowest average rate (although it remains above 3). This means respondents from large 
companies cannot easily perceive the complementarity of the guideline with existing practices. However, this should 
be explored further since average rates of respondents coming from both SMEs and large companies are generally 
above 4 for other criteria.         
 
Figure 4. Decision tree of the criterion Complementarity with existing practices   
  
One interesting perspective is to refine the mapping of the processes to the enabling principles and tools. This should 
consider two main factors, company size and manufacturing activity sector. Exploring these perspectives will help 
provide further guidance to customize the guideline, thus reinforcing its practicality. Another research avenue involves 
tailoring the processes, principles and tools of the framework to specific projects considering readiness of the company 
with regard to agility. This could benefit from existing and abundant research works about agility assessment, e.g. 
alternatives evaluation in a mass customization context (Ren et al., 2009), supply chain agility index (Lin et al., 2006). 
 
One research perspective involves capitalizations and reuse of experiences all along processes to achieve agility. By 
capitalizing and reusing experiences and knowledge, organizations can continuously improve their processes and adapt 
to changes in the marketplace (Llamas et al., 2016). In fact, knowledge management can play an important role in 
improving the way agility improvement projects are planned and executed. Knowledge management practices, such 
as knowledge sharing and knowledge creation, are positively associated with agility in manufacturing organizations. 
They help organizations better understand and respond to changes in their environment, which is a key aspect of agility 
(Soltaninezhad et al., 2021). By facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration among project team members, project 
team members will have the information and expertise they need to make informed decisions and take appropriate 
actions.  
  
5. Conclusion 
The paper builds on existing literature as well as empirical investigation to provide a comprehensive framework for 
planning, implementing and sustaining agility improvement actions. Framework processes, enabling principles and 
tools help ensure an incremental and sustained progress in the agile production path. Practitioners’ feedback confirmed 
the relevance of the framework to agile production and uncovered some promising research avenues such as tailoring 
the framework.

Abstract 
The scheduling problem for identical parallel machines, with the objective of minimizing total tardiness, holds 
significant importance in production scheduling. However, addressing large-scale instances of this scheduling 
problem, involving numerous jobs and machines, has proven challenging. The application of metaheuristic 
approaches, such as Simulated Annealing, has been observed efficient in solving complex combinatorial optimization 
problems. This paper presents a Simulated Annealing algorithm to address the identical machine scheduling problem 
aimed at minimizing total tardiness. A practical application of scheduling jobs on identical machines in die casting 
industry is presented through a numerical example.

Abstract 
Education 4.0 is a new paradigm that is already transforming the learning experience. The fourth industrial revolution 
unveiled vast opportunities for Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things. Employing those smart techniques paves 
the way for an advanced education system where customized lifelong learning is universally accessible. However, 
realizing the full benefits of Education 4.0 hinges on enhancing the capabilities of educators to ensure they can 
navigate such sophisticated technologies and methods. This study aims to explore the variables affecting the readiness 
to utilize the knowledge and skills of Education 4.0 amongst engineering professors in the University of Jeddah. In 
total, 22 faculty members across various ranks and disciplines participated in the study. The results revealed the level 
of educators’ familiarity with Education 4.0 methods such as personalized learning, blended learning and 
virtual/augmented reality. In addition, the benefits and obstacles of each method is documented. The results also 
indicate that there is a positive correlation between academic rank and familiarity with Education 4.0, suggesting that 
faculty members with higher academic ranks tend to have a better understanding of these modern teaching methods. 
The present study has also identified a number of recommendations to enhance the underlying factors that influence 
the adoption of Education 4.0 in the college. Future research could evaluate the extent to which educator’s familiarity 
with Education 4.0 contribute to better student engagement and therefore a better participatory learning environment.

Abstract 
Life is what you make out of it. The past is gone. Do your best in the present and that will shape your future. It is 
stated by wise people that the universe, its creation, human perception and reality as we know is an allusion. Reality 
is not what you see. What you see depends upon the color of your glasses and is a function of earlier life impressions, 
this life actions, environment, education and training while leading life on this earth. In spite of all this, it is important 
to do the best. For doing the best we need to understand the process of doing the best by following our heart. shows 
the process, called heartfulness (HFN) meditation or contemplation. As mentioned in references, meditation helps 
develop 3 skills, such as 1) discernment, 2) will power and 3) discipline. For being successful in any profession you 
must have these skills. Thus, HFN meditation helps normalize ego, greed and nurture wise executor leading to human 
integration.

1. Introduction
Pay attention upon the birth and death of humans. These events are not in anybody’s control. The leading 
psychotherapist, Michael Newton reference (Newton, M., 1995, 2000) has shown the existence of reincarnation. 
Before, accidentally directing his patient to reveal her life experiences 500 years back, he did not believe in 
reincarnation.  Through his extensive work, regression analysis of thousands of individuals, he has revealed that souls 
take birth in the family of his/her own choice. Most people believe that all the souls on the earth (Figure 1a) come 
from the same source, brighter world, and has the same origin (Figure 1b).  Still, look at how people are fooling 
themselves by killing their own brothers/sisters and other relations. Figure 1 shows the souls taking birth on earth 
every moment.

7. Concluding Remarks
HFN Meditation is a process to develop a balance between material and inner life. The nurturing of wiser ego amongst 
most of the individuals creates an egrigore for human integration. This is a step towards making more of our friends 
aware of the services available to them free of charge.

Enhancing Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies for 
the Infant Formula Milk Supply Chain through Hybrid 
AHP-TOPSIS Analysis 
Mona Haji

Abstract 
Infant formula milk (IFM) is critical in many babies' diets and must be high-quality. Unfortunately, IFM has been an 
adulteration target by those attempting to make illegal profits and has suffered from contamination-related issues. This 
study’s main objective was to identify the most critical risks affecting IFM quality in the supply chain and determine 
mitigation strategies to improve IFM performance measurement. We developed a model to reduce adulteration and 
contamination rates in the infant formula milk supply chains (IFMSCs) and maximize safety. The steps to achieve the 
study’s objectives included (1) identifying the importance of IFMs for infant nutrition and their risks, (2) establishing 
mitigation criteria for evaluating IFMSC’s performance to maximize quality, and (3) analyzing each mitigation 
criterion to maximize IFM safety. Based on pairwise comparisons by professionals in the food supply chain (FSC) of 
decision-making, the hybrid Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity 
to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model were used to analyze and prioritize mitigation alternatives to develop a model 
that can prioritize and select the best criteria for maximizing IFM safety and achieving the study objective. According 
to the contamination quality risk agents, mitigation alternative (QR.M2) ranked highest in both tests. This study’s 
findings illustrate how vital it is to avoid risk when dealing with public health, especially infants’ health, and how IFM 
must undergo precise testing and quality checks at every supply chain stage to ensure quality.

1. Introduction
Infant milk is a component of a baby’s diet that must be high-quality to ensure healthy growth and development. Of 
the two sources of infant milk, the main one is breast milk, which is recognized as the ideal form of infant feeding and 
provides multiple benefits for a child’s health. The promotion, protection, and support of breastfeeding is therefore 
critical. For infants incapable of breastfeeding, who should not receive breast milk, or for whom breast milk is 
unavailable, high-quality infant formula milk (IFM) is the other preferred option (Kleczka and Shamir 2006). 
However, only 38% of infants worldwide are exclusively breastfed, and among Americans, only 13% initiate 
breastfeeding exclusively for a period not less than six months after birth (Martin et al. 2016). When the quality is 
high, IFM can be an effective breastfeeding substitute. For the first six months of a child’s life, breastfeeding should 
be the sole source of nutrition. 
With life demands increasing and women’s need to work, many mothers rely on IFMs to feed their infants directly 
after delivery. Because IFM is such an essential product, no home that needs it should be without it, especially when 
infants require food to meet their nutritional needs. Even though a product identical to breast milk cannot be produced, 
every effort has been made to mimic and replicate the nutrition profile of breast milk to fulfill infants’ needs.

Abstract 
Introducing Total Quality Management (TQM) system in the operation of consulting and construction organizations 
could result in improved quality product, performance and enhance clients’ satisfaction. However, if the process is 
not implemented successfully, organizations do not reap the inherent benefits of adopting TQM. A Civil Engineering 
Consulting company that specializes in structural engineering, transportation engineering, and water engineering 
introduced the TQM system in 2008, to improve its service delivery. Inadvertently, after twelve years of operation, 
the intended improvements are not obvious. Therefore, the focus of this study is to identify the constraints responsible 
for the non-functionality of the TQM system. The case study research strategy of qualitative research was adopted, 
the data collected using mixed methods involving online questionnaire, interviews, and document analysis. The 
findings identified factors responsible for the low functionality of the TQM system in the organization, namely, 
ineffective communication, lack of training on the use of the TQM system, absence of progressive monitoring, low 
commitment by senior management, unavailability of quality documentation, absence of quality management 
personnel and the low involvement of employees. The research concludes that the success or otherwise, in the 
implementation of the TQM system, is significantly influenced by participation of senior management of the 
organization, which requires paradigm shift and demonstrated commitment to the implementation of the system.

1 Introduction 
The market identifies the main competitiveness criteria, which include quality, innovation, price, reliability, operating 
costs, delivery time and service convenience. In the competitive environment, organizations are required to respond 
quickly to consumers’ demands as their response will determine their share in the market (Semenov et al  2016). This 
compels organisations to re-engineer their operations and systems to be more customer-centred and address the multi-
dimensional demand and globalisation challenges. All organizations are required to efficiently participate in this market 
where client expectations are increasing, and quality is essential (Ooi et al 2011). In service organisations, quality 
encompasses the result and the process because service production and consumption are not easily separated. Customers 
are the judges of quality in that if the results exceed expectations, then a customer is happy and when the opposite 
occurs then the customer is not satisfied (Sharabi and Davidow 2010).  
Total quality management (TQM) is the process of identifying and administering the activities necessary to achieve the 
organisations’ quality objectives, aimed at meeting customers’ needs satisfactorily, which requires adequate 
understanding of customers’ requirements (Puyzdek and Keller 2013),( Harte and Dale 1995). Quality management 
creates an environment and culture enabling the service provider to prevent faults instead of rectifying them (Culp et al

introduced the TQM tools. Inadvertently, the objective of introducing this tool have not been fully realised. Exploring 
the constraints and how to ameliorate the negative effects and chat a positive way forward are the objectives of this 
research.  
 
4.Conclusion 
The purpose of this research was to evaluate the level of understanding, use and identify the constraints to the effective 
implementation of the TQM operation in the Civil Engineering company, used for this research. The company 
introduced the TQM system in 2008, to improve its service delivery, retain its market share in the competitive 
environment and enhance customers’ satisfaction. The case study method of qualitative research was employed to 
execute this research exercise. The findings revealed that it does not appear that the objectives for introducing the 
quality system is being achieved, especially with the spate of reworks, high level of low-quality service delivery and 
many customers have expressed their low level of satisfaction. The constraints observed are, among others, the lack 
of effective communication, training, active involvement of the employees and the commitment of senior 
management, as factors critically impacting the effective implementation of the TQM system.  
 
Therefore, this research recommends that the senior management should lead the re-kindled interest in the 
implementation of the TQM system by: 
 
• 
Employing quality management personnel to midwife the operation,  
• 
ensure effective communication,  
• 
Implementing a progressive training programme for employees 
• 
Involving employees in the implementation process to enhance understanding of the system 
• 
Documenting all make accessible all procedures and policies. 
 
Since this research was conducted in a single organisation, efforts should be made to evaluate the effectiveness or 
otherwise of implementing similar quality measures in other civil engineering consulting organizations, in South 
Africa or else where in the world for effective comparison.

Abstract 
Limited energy sourced from fossil fuels and world climate change is a challenge for energy security because the 
provision of adequate and affordable energy sources is imperative to support sustainable growth and development. In 
2021, the largest energy consumption is in the transportation sector, which is or 33 percent of the total national energy 
consumption. World climate change and fluctuations in the cost of fossil energy make the demand for electric vehicles 
one of the alternative choices in driving with the reason to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions. The purpose of this 
study is to  develop a model based on ant colony algorithm to determine the number of charging stations and locate 
them that minimize total setup cost, namely the initial cost of developing and the total power capacity of prospective 
charging stations, index of active power reduction, reactive power loss reduction and voltage profile improvement, 
and the probability of electric vehicles arrivals using ant colony algorithms. Objective functions are founded from 
weighting of function elements by Analytical Network Process. The location of the study was carried out by applying 
a model to the real case, namely the Trans Java toll road section which is the longest and most populous toll road 
section in Java, stretching between Jakarta to Surabaya, with a road length of about 1200 KM and daily traffic density 
of 688,000 vehicles.

1. Introduction
The average population growth of 1.6% each year contributes to the increasing demand for energy, specifically for 
fossil fuels (Huang et al., 2021). Additionally, the use of these fuels, which significantly contributes to global climate 
change, presents certain challenges to energy resilience [Sheng 1]. This means there is a need to provide sufficient 
and affordable energy to support sustainable growth and development. Moreover, the transportation sector was 
reported to have consumed the highest volume of energy in 2021, accounting for 388.42 million barrels of oil 
equivalent (MBOe) or 33% of the total national energy consumption. The report further showed that fossil energy was 
ranked first with 27.8% of national energy consumption (MEMRRI, 2022).  
The focus on global climate change and fluctuations in fossil energy costs was found to have increased the demand 
for electric vehicles (EV) as a choice to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (Parker et al., 2021). This is associated with 
the lower operational cost of electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel-powered cars (Zhu et al., 2021). The affordability 
is based on the development of lithium-ion battery technology, which has higher power and energy density in the 
range of 0.9-2.63 MJ/L compared to older battery types such as lead-acid batteries with 0.36 MJ/L.

Ant colonies that have been distributed to the first city will begin to travel from the first city (origin) and one of 
the other cities as the destination city. To determine the destination city is used the probability of the city will be 
visited as follows. 
 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
Recently, the number of SPKLU is 21 units. Meanwhile, the optimal number of SPKLU proposed is 25 units. The 
criteria used for optimal location determination are total setup cost (connector power value, connector development 
cost, installation cost, and land leasing cost), and index of active power reduction, reactive power loss reduction, and 
voltage profile improvement at every SPKLU. Table 10 shows the suitability of potential SPKLU location.

6. Conclusion 
In this study, we proposed a model based on ant colony algorithm to determine the number of charging stations and 
locate them that minimize total setup cost. The research benefits are to create a decision support system to assist 
decision-makers in making informed decisions on the determination of the optimal number of SPKLU needed as well 
as to ensure electric vehicle drivers experience safety and comfort, specifically along the Trans Java toll road. it is 
necessary to add a social cost component to make it more accurate.

Abstract 
The paramedical staff of the burn unit at an University Hospital Center requested the occupational health service 
to find a solution to the organizational constraints and health complaints that are leading to an increase in sick 
leave. To evaluate working conditions and health status, propose corrective measures, encourage management to 
provide appropriate solutions, and monitor the implementation and impact of proposed improvements. To 
complete this work, it seemed useful to propose an ergonomic intervention on the working conditions of 
paramedical staff by analyzing the work activity in the burn units and involving the concerned staff. The health 
status of the paramedical staff was assessed by reviewing the medical records. This study highlighted several 
organizational constraints, including the work carried out by nursing assistants and public health nurses outside 
the scope of competencies defined by law. The lack of paramedical staff, which can impact the health of these 
agents and therefore work stoppages. The observation also highlighted the age of the facility and equipment. All 
the constraints and problems observed during our study were discussed at a meeting with the hospital management. 
Increasing staffing and a renovation or replacement project for the facility were the solutions proposed at the 
meeting. Monitoring is essential to verify the implementation of these solutions. Improving working conditions 
has a strong influence on the behavior of paramedical staff, their health, their work motivation, and consequently 
on the performance of the burn unit.

Abstract 
Following the reporting of an occupational accident that occurred in a cement plant and resulted in the death of two 
workers during a cement unblocking operation, we conducted an investigation whose objective is to identify the causes 
and factors that led to the accident and prevent other possible accidents. The method used in analyzing the accident is 
the fault tree analysis conducted immediately after the accident. The facts were gathered concerning the individual, the 
task performed, the equipment used, and the work environment. The accident, which occurred two and a half hours 
(2:30) after the start of the shift, caused two victims who were buried under tons of cement. Their activity consisted of 
almost manually removing the cement stuck to the walls of the silos. The fault tree analysis highlights factors related 
to the environment and tools. The individual factor, essentially linked to the professionalism and expertise of the 
construction manager, is also implicated. The occurrence of this accident has a multifactorial origin, particularly work 
organization and negligence of risks, and to avoid other accidents we favor evaluating situations before intervention 
and periodic maintenance of work facilities.

1. Introduction
Following the reporting of a work accident in a cement plant that resulted in the death of two workers during a cement 
deburring operation, we conducted an investigation with the objective of searching for the causes and factors that led 
to the accident and prevent other possible accidents. According to researches, five main factors such as Employees 
factor, State policy factor, Workplace factor, Economic factor, and  Employer factor are related to work accidents can 
be listed (Barreto, 2000, Ceylan 2012, Chau 2010, INRS, 2020, Nezzal 2023) 
The method used in analyzing the accident is the fault tree analysis conducted immediately after the accident. The facts 
were gathered concerning the individual, the task performed, the equipment used, and the work environment. The 
accident, which occurred two and a half hours (2:30) after the start of the shift, caused two victims who were buried 
under tons of cement.  
Their activity consisted of almost manually removing the cement stuck to the walls of the silos. The fault tree analysis 
highlights factors related to the environment and tools. The individual factor, essentially linked to the professionalism 
and expertise of the construction manager, is also implicated 
2. Objective
Objective is to identify the causes and factors that led to the accident and prevent other possible accidents 
3. Method
The method used in analyzing the accident was constructing a cause-tree immediately after the accident occurred.

5.3 Corrective Measures 
Enforcing organizational provisions that prevent workers from being positioned at the bottom of the silo, eliminating 
the risk of being buried in the event of cement collapse. 
 
Conducting a risk assessment (on site) before the start of any intervention operation by a team trained in 
occupational health and safety. 
 
Periodic maintenance and cleaning of work equipment (silos) 
 
Training the staff of silo maintenance and cleaning companies in cement deburring and informing them of the 
risks. 
 
Automating the operation to eliminate the danger at the source.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The occurrence of this accident has a multifactorial origin, notably the work organization, negligence of risks, and 
particularly the method used since it is inherently dangerous itself. To prevent other similar accidents, we recommend 
adopting new techniques that comply with safety regulations.

Abstract 
Building inspection plays a significant role in the construction of buildings of every country. Just like any other 
industry building inspection has its own challenges. This paper firstly investigates the challenges of the current 
municipal inspection system and secondly determine an alternative approach to building inspections challenges in 
South African municipalities. This paper also gives recommendation on how to address the challenges faced by 
building inspectors. As an alternative approach to building inspection challenges in South Africa. 
The study focused on assessing the challenges based on available literature and on user perspective to improve the 
building inspections within municipalities.

1. Introduction
Building inspection is important to the national development plan of every country. It is an essential task in ensuring 
that buildings are built in accordance with the relevant building regulations and standards including the National 
Building Regulation and Building Standard Act No 103 of 1977 during construction process. As per the National 
Building Regulation and Building Standard, inspection is defined as “ the general inspection by a competent person 
of a system or measure or installation of a building, or part thereof, at such intervals as might be necessary in 
accordance with accepted professional practice to enable such competent person to be satisfied that the design 
assumptions are valid, the design is being correctly interpreted and the work is being executed generally in accordance 
with the designs, appropriate construction techniques and good practice but shall exclude detailed supervision and 
day-to-day inspection” (Keuter, 2008).

3. Research Methodology 
This article is based on a literature reviews whose goal was to firstly to investigate the challenges of the current 
municipal inspection system by analyzing reports on different literature relating to building inspection. Lastly to 
determine an alternative approach that can be effective for building inspections. Previous reports information was 
reviewed, and key ongoing findings were adapted. The data was gathered from previous literatures and then 
analyzed. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The significance goal of this study was to investigate the challenges of the current municipal inspection system and 
to determine an alternative approach that can be effective for building inspections. The reviewed literature showed 
that in the areas where building regulations are omitted may not necessarily be intentional as there is a possibility 
that the building inspector of that particular area may not understand the building regulations as a result of lack of 
knowledge of building inspections and building manuals. This may also be because of house owners or contractors 
who have no knowledge of how the municipality operate due to lack of workshops with house owners and 
contractors. 
 
Failure to orientate and induct new workers affect the productivity of workers as Martel, (2002) stated that, well-
oriented worker is much capable of being productive for the company. On the other side, building regulations are 
omitted as a result of corruption by building inspector, this is done for self-benefit by either the inspector or 
contractor. Bribe is one of the leading form corruptions which most people are exposed to. Workers with low 
income have a character of being exposed to bribe and neglecting processes. Education is regarded important in a 
nation that seek to fight poverty, illiteracy and grow the economy. Lastly the act of corruption is evidence that 
building regulations are omitted. 
 
5. Recommendation 
The primary goal of this study was to investigate the challenges of the current municipal inspection system which 
was affected by lack of understanding of building inspections, workshop, induction and orientation, corruption, 
bribery, income, education and negligence of building regulations. Determining an alternative approach to building 
inspections challenges in South African municipalities will mean that the following should be addressed in this 
manner. 
• 
The municipality should establish inspection classes for every inspector which shall then teach them more 
about building regulations and other instrument of knowledge that are relevant to building inspection to 
ensure that inspectors are familiar with the regulations and to encourage them to register with the council, 
this will also assist in mitigating negligence of building regulations. 
• 
Secondly the municipality needs to establish a culture of hosting workshops with the community to acquaint 
them with the municipality and how it operates. induction and orientation should be done do all new 
appointed workers in order to welcome them and to induct them on their roles. 
• 
Furthermore, a system of reporting corruption should establish in order to report and lay complains about 
the maltreatment, behaviour, bribes, professionalism, etc of that particular inspector. This will assist the 
municipality when making individual assessment and giving inductions to new employee’s. 
• 
In order to fight corruption a system of rotation between building inspector’s areas should be implemented 
so that building inspectors may not feel comfortable about one area of work and lastly after every final 
inspection, the chief building inspector should visit the site before issuing of certificate of occupancy.  
• 
Education should never be compromised when coming to selection criteria this will help to select applicants 
who have adequate knowledge of building inspection.

results presented in the case study and the use of LEAN tools associated with the PDCA method showed that the 
objective was achieved. 
 
The LEAN tools proposed in the literature affirm their potential to eliminate waste in the production process. The case 
study demonstrates the efficiency of these tools and the proposal resulting from the analysis made it possible to 
optimize the performance of the Serra Leste terminal with: (i) an increase in mean weight of 2.45 t/wagon, (ii) a 
reduction in variability, (iii) a reduction in the loading cycle time, (iv) more agility in train detour and (v) 
standardization of technical references to stabilize the process.  
 
Despite the simplified analysis of the Value Stream Mapping (VSM), it was clear that the process had a lot of rework. 
The application of the future flow connected with LEAN assumptions reduced the stages of loading wagons by 50% 
and enabled the elimination of 30 deviations, 4 of which were MURI, 7 MURA and 19 MUDA. 
 
As a continuation of the theme, process mapping has opened up the prospect of further research. One obvious need is 
to investigate the failure modes of the physical availability of wheel loaders. The physical availability of the machines 
is a key factor in achieving key indicators at the terminal, especially the time it takes to load the wagons. Another 
research alternative is the arrangement of the products in the loading bay, since the travel time of the machines changes 
depending on how the products are allocated in the loading bay. Finally, we also suggest an analysis of the length of 
the loading area, seeking to optimize the number of machines and make equipment manoeuvring more flexible. 
 
Throughout this study, we devoted our attention to implementing creative, low-cost measures aimed at substantially 
improving the mean loading weight of wagons used to transport iron ore. The results obtained not only achieved the 
target set, but also point to significant advances in the operational efficiency and sustainability of rail transportation. 
The evaluation of performance indicators, including operational efficiency and cost reduction, has shown that the 
improvements in mean weight are not just numerical, but have practical and tangible implications for the day-to-day 
running of rail operations.

Abstract 
The oil and gas industry, marked by its intricate infrastructure and dependence on equipment reliability, progressively 
embraces Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies to drive operational excellence. This study presents a comprehensive 
framework for integrating I4.0 principles with Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) strategies aimed at 
revolutionising maintenance practices in the sector. The research addresses recurring industry challenges, including 
equipment failures, production disruptions, and rising maintenance costs. It leverages a rigorous literature review, 
empirical data, and Delphi study to develop an innovative I4.0-based CBM framework designed to harness real-time 
diagnostics and predictive analytics. This framework provides a systematic, actionable roadmap for organisations 
looking to enhance equipment reliability, reduce downtime, and optimise maintenance expenditures. As part of the 
I4.0-based CBM framework, the study introduces an I4.0 Maturity Model and an online assessment tool, enabling 
maintenance professionals to gauge their readiness and progress in adopting I4.0-enabled CBM practices. The research 
culminates in the real-world application of the developed framework within an operational oil and gas organisation in 
Nigeria. This application demonstrates tangible enhancements in equipment reliability, production efficiency, and 
maintenance strategy optimisation. Insights from empirical deployment showcases the transformative potential of 
I4.0-enabled CBM in driving operational efficiency. 
This research significantly contributes to the field of industrial operations management, offering a practical guide for 
organisations in the oil and gas sector and beyond. It presents a blueprint for leveraging I4.0 technologies to redefine 
maintenance paradigms, foster innovation, and enhance operational efficiency, paving the way for a sustainable and 
competitive future in the oil and gas industry.

Abstract 
This study investigates into the sustainability landscape of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through the Circular 
Economy (CE) principles, emphasizing four conflicting multi-objectives: economic, environmental, energy, and 
circularity development. Over recent years, CE has witnessed substantial growth, offering compelling opportunities 
for sustainable development. This expansion enables businesses and industry sectors to integrate CE into their 
overarching strategies, positioning it as an appealing alternative for manufacturing companies aiming to enhance 
performance through optimized resource efficiency. The study quantifies these objectives by maximizing GDP, 
minimizing GHG emissions, electricity consumption, and waste generation, respectively and optimizing number of 
employees. Two models are formulated based on these objectives, with the second model incorporating waste 
recycling. Utilizing a goal programming approach, the models are applied to assess eight economic sectors in the 
UAE. This research seeks to make a substantial contribution to both researchers and practitioners, enhancing 
sustainable theory and offering practical guidance for those aiming to promote their enterprise’s sustainable 
development. The findings emphasize the significance of waste minimization and recycling in attaining the country’s 
sustainability goals, highlighting their impact on energy conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Industry 4.0 Implementation Barriers for SMEs: A 
Proposed Decision-Support Model of the Most Appropriate 
Adoption Route

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 (I4.0) promises to transform business processes through digital interconnectivity to increase operational 
efficiency. However, 13 years since its inception, the uptake of I4.0 technologies by companies is still rather low. Our 
Systematic Literature Review (SLR) shows the different barriers that companies are facing to adopt Industry 4.0 in 
business production and supply chain operations. These barriers are amplified when it comes to the small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs). Our Literature review also demonstrates that there is still limited empirical research on how SMEs 
can be supported to decide the best route to adopt Industry 4.0 given the different barriers. Thus, this research aims to 
extend the literature review analysis by developing a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model that can act as 
decision-support tool to help SMEs to determine the most ideal route to adoption of new Industry 4.0 technologies 
given the different barriers. In order to develop our MCDA model, we identified and interviewed representatives from 
different groups of stakeholders including: (1) business executives, comprising of persons in SME companies 
responsible for decision-making on operational strategies to be designed and implemented; (2) digital solutions 
providers, who develop and supply the new I4.0 solutions across the market; and (3) an Industry expert/consultant, 
who provides customers with the knowledge and guidance on the most appropriate solution for their business. Using 
the developed MCDA, we show some trade-offs that SMEs are facing in adopting I4.0.  
Keywords 
Industry 4.0, Barriers, SMEs, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis 
1. Introduction
The fourth industrial revolution, commonly referred to as Industry 4.0 (I.4 0) was first introduced in 2011 during the 
launch of Germany’s High-Tech Strategy 2020 Plan during the Hanover Fair (Xu, Xu and Li, 2018). The plan was 
aimed at revolutionizing manufacturing processes through use of advanced technology. This influenced other 
countries to do the same, hence creating a buzz. Consequently, since the concept of I4.0 is inherently digitally driven, 
multiple technologies began to emerge such as, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality, augmented reality, 
3D printing, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, smart sensors, cloud computing, radio-frequency 
identification (RFID), robotics, and other cyber-physical systems (CPS), among others (Fernando et al., 2023; Sony 
et al., 2021; James et al., 2022). Despite the buzz around I4.0, especially AI, there is still a low adoption in businesses 
more than 12 years later, especially by the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), who make up a majority of the 
companies in most countries (Goel et al., 2022). This research therefore seeks to investigate the barriers impeding the 
implementation of I4.0 into SMEs’ production and supply chain activities. It considers the managerial perspective of 
the barriers as they are the key decision-makers on whether the enterprise will adopt I4.0. Additionally, lack of 
management support for I4.0 has been found to be one of the most significant barriers to its implementation (Machado 
et al., 2021; Herceg et al., 2020; Chauhan, Singh and Luthra, 2021). This research goes into the mind of a business 
executive, seeking to understand the factors that prevent them from making the decision to adopt I4.0 for their

above, indicating that the decisionmaker is very concerned about cost, maintaining the existing technology would be 
most preferred (orange line). Literature shows that this is the case for most SME companies as access to capital is still 
a challenge due to their perceived risk profile by financial institutions (Kumar, Vrat and Shankar, 2021a). The 
sensitivity of alternatives against the weighting on benefit was also plotted as shown in the graph in Figure 4 (B). 
 
 
 
At the current weight of the benefit category (0.429 per value tree), purchasing a new off-the-shelf solution is the most 
preferred option (maroon line). The weighting on both the cost and benefit category are close (0.32 and 0.429 
respectively), which explains arriving at the same ideal options in the two sensitivity graphs. This means that SMEs 
on average look for a balance between cost and benefit when making investment decisions. If the benefit category 
weight was to be increased to about 0.6, the most ideal alternative would be to design and build the solution as it 
would mean a higher expected ROI and the creation of a reliable technology solution that is scalable in the medium 
term as new technologies continue to emerge.  
 
6. Conclusion and future research  
This research aimed to evaluate the barriers to I4.0 adoption by SMEs. This research has also proposed MCDA as a 
robust decision support model for managers to determine the most ideal route to I4.0 adoption, including the option 
to maintain the existing technology depending on the decision-maker’s circumstances. An empirical study was carried 
out to show the systematic process of conducting the MCDA methodology. This will provide a reference point for 
future decision-makers in need of a decision support model to help in solving complex issues.  
 
To effectively apply MCDA for decision support, it is recommended that managers collaborate so as to arrive at a 
consensus on the ideal criteria rankings and weights. Additionally, when evaluating the I4.0 technologies to adopt, 
businesses should ensure that the intervention selected does not lead to layoffs above a certain threshold. This is 
because technologies are not meant to replace human beings, but to enable them to carry out their tasks more 
efficiently. Finally, to reduce data security risk, it is recommended that decision-makers seek to first understand the 
technology before adopting. This would include asking questions such as: What data is required? How will the data 
be used? How will it be stored? How can it be monitored to ensure legitimacy of results? The responses to these 
questions should be captured in the agreement so that it is binding between the parties, and legal recourse can be 
sought in the event of any breach.  
 
The output of this research is an initial step for future research that aims to validate and generalize the proposed 
MCDA using in-depth case studies. There will also be a need to improve the proposed MCDA to focus on a specific 
technology, based on the given context. Future research will also consider how the uncertainty of decision makers 
about the benefits and the cost of different technologies can be taken into account.

Abstract 
Scheduling patient appointments at a hemodialysis center is a unique challenge, unlike other healthcare appointment 
scheduling problems. Patients require a series of dialysis treatment sessions rather than a single appointment. We 
formulate this multiple-appointment system as a set-partitioning model and solve it using a branch-and-price 
algorithm. Since dynamic programming doesn't perform very well for solving the pricing subproblem, we further 
decompose it and solve it using a novel column-generation-based approach. Additionally, we design a greedy heuristic 
to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm.

Abstract 
The best tool for acquiring information is research, this is one of the reasons why man is distinguished from other 
species on planet Earth. In man's desire to understand the nature that surrounds him, various obstacles appeared, one 
of which is being able to enter places that are difficult to physically access such as canyons or sea caves. It is for this 
reason that a means is developed by which three-dimensional modeling of the aquatic surface will be carried out based 
on the detection of obstacles and measurement of distance using ultrasound. This project presents the response to this 
problem through the use of ultrasound, which is responsible for sending and receiving sound waves for measuring 
distance on aquatic surfaces and the use of a radar that sends and receives electromagnetic waves with the objective 
to detect obstacles in the research route. The results of the development of this project are greater access to natural or 
superficial places with complicated characteristics for human entry, allowing the recognition of the interior of these 
ecosystems through modeling of the environment in which the environment is located. In short, the progress of this 
project will be of great contribution to different sectors such as research, construction, social, among others, whose 
procedure is the prior study of the environment for the development of the work.

1. Introduction
Nature has always been defined as a “neutral” and “unpredictable” field because, due to our own works (roads, water 
houses, bridges, etc.), they come to be destroyed by natural phenomena. That is why we need to have devices capable 
of performing tasks for which humans are not prepared and thus making work easier (Bellavista 2016). The latter 
would not be possible if, starting with the Industrial Revolution, science and technology were irreversibly merged 
(Echo location 2017). Currently, many construction companies or simply related studies on the aquatic surface use 
technologies or electronic devices to carry out their previous studies in the work area. But in a large part of Peru 
(specifically in the jungle), not much of this technology is available for the construction of traditional Amazonian 
houses, since these have as their main piece the piles or pillars that will be the base of the house, which are buried 
approximately 6 meters deep (Lupiáñez and Sánchez 2019).

Within the period of time in which the Bluetooth means of transport mobilizes the radar in order to make the 
corresponding measurements, the 9-volt battery that powers the Bluetooth boat motor suffers wear and tear due to the 
consumption of the DC motor. In Figure 8, you can see a large voltage consumption at the beginning of operation. 
This is because the motor starts up in such a short period of time. Subsequently, it can be seen that after the boot 
interval, moderate battery consumption appears. It should be noted that the motor stops after 110 seconds of continuous 
work; however, by applying a small force to the motor propeller, it starts spinning again, but at a lower speed than 
before. 
 
6. Conclusions 
From the development of this work, the following conclusions can be obtained: 
• A mobile boat was designed and built based on an Arduino platform with an ultrasonic sensor; these sensors 
allowed responses to be obtained as stipulated in the flow chart. However, the logic in the diagram, mainly in 
the sensor control code, allowed us to observe a series of improvements and updates on the operation of the 
robot with the aim of having the highest possible efficiency.  
• The use of an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles on a water surface was an efficient option since ultrasonic 
waves can be reflected by objects present in the aquatic environment, providing information about the presence 
of obstacles. However, it is important to consider factors such as the propagation of ultrasonic waves in water, 
which can affect accuracy over greater distances.  
• Continuous optimization of detection algorithms and data processing techniques is essential to improving the 
accuracy and reliability of this model. Additionally, this two-dimensional water surface model may need to be 
integrated with other sensors to address specific limitations or improve the robustness of the system under 
different conditions.

Identifying the Role of Emulsion and Nano-emulsion for 
Predicting the Residual Heavy Oil Recovery

Abstract 
The energy sector as well as daily needs of our day-to-day life depends majorly on the utilization of crude oil and its 
derived products. Therefore, to overcome the basic demands it is mandatory to extract crude oil from existing matured 
reservoirs. In this work, we have investigated the mechanistic studies of emulsification as well as nano-emulsification 
and identifying their role on heavy residual oil recovery. The heavy was oil emulsified using surfactants and polymer 
which were stable up to 24 hours and this assists in improving the trapped residual oil displacement efficiency, thereby 
reducing the saturation of residual oil inside the reservoir. On the other hand, when nanoparticles were introduced in 
the same surfactant-polymer system, nano emulsions were observed whose stability were enhanced at a greater rate 
(up to days) and thus further assist in improved the residual oil recovery. It was observed that average size of the nano-
emulsion in microns were smaller (with a greater number of droplets) as compared to emulsion. This phenomenon 
thereby enhances the stability period and diverts the displacing fluid to cover more area of the reservoirs resulting in 
higher oil recovery due to higher sweep efficiency. Moreover, core flooding experiments conducted showed an oil 
recovery of 18% (residual oil in place, RIOP) and was enhanced to 26% RIOP when nanoparticles were deployed in 
the system.

1. Introduction
The escalating demand in crude oil production is governing the price of the crude oil in the international market. 
Therefore, petroleum industries are in a process to produce large quantity of crude oil to generate more revenue, 
especially when the price of crude oil barrel is high. There exist, the conventional production methods which are 
known as primary and secondary water flooding techniques. These combined, accounts to a maximum of 30-35% of 
original oil in place (OOIP) recovery. The oil and gas industries are exploring numerous available advanced techniques 
with an aim to overcome the limitations in crude oil productions. Those techniques thereby can be termed as enhanced 
oil recovery (EOR) (Olajire, 2014; Phukan and Saha, 2022; Sheng, 2013). 
Chemical enhanced oil recovery is one of the branches of EOR techniques which play a major role in recovering 
residual oil when the existing energy in the reservoir undergoes exhaustion and additional water flooding results in 
viscous fingering effect. Similarly, there exist other EOR schemes such as microbial, thermal, solvent and others. The 
selection of appropriate EOR methods depends on several factors like reservoir area, thickness, depth, porosity, 
permeability, crude oil properties (oil saturation, API gravity, acid value, viscosity), reservoir fluid, reservoir salinity 
and temperature, reservoir rock characteristics, etc. 
Surfactant-based flooding under chemical EOR is one of the successful and promising choices for reservoirs to recover 
residual oil. Surfactant results in emulsification of crude oil/heavy crude oil which is a major factor in deciding the oil

water droplets. Tx-100 must have undergone high electrostatic repulsion forces which does not allow the oil droplets 
to bridge/coalescence and thus high stability was detected. The other surfactants showed more or less similar 
electrostatic forces (attraction or repulsion) and therefore, there stability were similar. Moreover, the other possibilities 
could be due the steric hindrance formation with Tx-100 which governs the coalescence droplets and thus introduces 
better emulsion stability (Saha et al., 2018a). 
 
However, when SiO2 nanoparticles of 0.1 wt% was introduces in the same system (nanofluid), the emulsion stability 
behaviour were enhanced as illustrated in Figure 2c. The enhancement in the stability was due to the adsorption of 
nanoparticles at the oil-water interface. The adsorbed nanoparticles with proper packing of surfactant molecules at its 
surfaces, reduces the droplet coalescence due to higher electrostatic repulsive forces. Additionally, nano-emulsion 
induces by nanoparticles were much stable as compared to normal emulsion, which could be due to the accumulation 
of higher number of surfactant molecules at the oil-water interface as assisted by nanoparticles, thereby reducing the 
interface dissimilarities. Thus, the improvement of emulsion stability with nanoparticles is expected to reduce the 
water channelling and improve the oil recovery factor. Therefore, the confirmation in residual oil recovery was 
confirmed by core flooding experiments.

nanoparticles (b) and with nanoparticles (c). 
 
3.2 Core flooding oil recovery 
The oil recovery obtained by core flooding experiments using sandpack is formulated in Table 2. The porosity of the 
sandpack were close to 30% with permeability approximately 1800 mD. The oil saturation was more than 80% in each 
run of the core flooding experiment. The data showed that oil recovery with secondary water flooding was almost 
30% of the original oil in place (OOIP). Moreover, with surfactant flooding for which high emulsion were observed 
(TX-100), a recovery of around 19% were accomplished. The recovery was enhanced to 24% for nanofluid solutions 
(TX-100 and SiO2 nanoparticles mixture) and this was due to the higher emulsion stability that improves the residual 
oil displacement efficiency.

1. The selected surfactants (SDS, SDBS, AOS and TX-100) were able to formed emulsions with the crude oil 
belonging to light to moderate category. 
2. Surfactant Triton X-100 showed better interaction with the crude oil to produce stable emulsion as compared 
to the other three surfactants. 
3. Nanofluid solution prepared by deploying SiO2 nanoparticles in Triton X-100 solution, showed promising 
emulsion stability as compared to normal emulsion formed by Triton X-100. 
4. Finally, the core flooding studies confirmed the potential of nano-emulsion by producing 24% additional oil

Abstract 
PT PHR as an upstream energy company has a vision to become a world-class energy company. The company has a 
mission to run oil, gas, and new and renewable energy businesses in an integrated manner, based on strong commercial 
principles. The KB field is part of PT PHR's Zone 4 working area whose main production is crude oil for then sale to 
a refinery unit in Plaju PLG, The associated gas (asso gas) separated from the gross fluid in the existing condition is 
burned through the flare stack because the quantity is quite small and the pressure is not able to enter the sales network. 
In 2023, PT PHR Zona 4 proposed an advanced development plan in the KB field by proposing the drilling of new 
infill wells and also workover work for existing wells to increase the forecast oil and gas production significantly, this 
must also be accompanied by the development of production facilities (SP KB) to be able to handle gross fluids that 
will be processed at SP KB. The author uses a concise structured process to achieve effective research objectives. The 
author will follow the conceptual framework that has been built. Quantitative data is obtained from existing data within 
the company, while qualitative data is obtained from brainstorming results. All necessary information and data are 
further analyzed according to the conceptual framework. To ensure that the recommended operations management 
strategy is carried out through technical analysis, a mathematical model study is conducted using several proven tools 
for business strategy.

1. Introduction
The oil and gas industry are one of the most vital industries for the State of Indonesia. The demand for the availability 
of natural gas for consumption in the South Sumatra region is still very high. These needs, among others, are intended 
for industrial activities. In terms of meeting this demand, PT PHR as one of the upstream oils & gas industry 
cooperation contractors in Indonesia carries out exploration and production activities through development in the KB 
Field (Arnold 2018, Kidnay et al, 2011, Bullin and Krouskop 2009, Liu 2022). 
KB Field is one of the crude oil producing fields in PT PHR zone 4. Currently there are 4 producing wells in the KB 
field which flow to the production facility at SP KB to be separated between liquid and gas fluids. Oil from KB Field 
will then be sent to the PPP PBM and will be pumped to the refinery unit in Plaju, PLG. In the KB field there is no 
dedicated gas well but there is associated gas (asso gas) from crude oil produced by wells in the KB field. Because 
the amount is quite small and the pressure is low, the gas is burned through the flare stack. Because it cannot be used 
for own used or sales, for fuel gas needs in the KB field currently using gas from SKG 1 LM delivered through SP V

Figure 10. Quantitative Comparison gas asso flare vs gas asso utilization 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on operational problems related to gas flares at SP KB which have not previously been utilized properly, through 
the analysis of this paper it can be recommended that this gas can be used to increase capital gains by adding production 
facilities as follows: 
• 
Using asso gas in the KB field can reduce carbon emissions and also increase capital gains in the KB field. 
• 
To utilize asso gas at SP KB, it is necessary to install a gas compressor with a capacity of 3 x 0.7 MMSCFD 
rotary-screw type and build a 4-inch long gas pipeline for 4.4 km from SP KB to SP V LM. 
• 
Utilization of asso gas provides higher quantitative results (costs) and capital gains compared to burning Asso 
gas. 
• 
Utilization of asso gas provides the highest qualitative results compared to asso flaring gas from an economic 
aspect.

Abstract 
Industrial companies working to improve CNC (Computer Numerical Control) mechanical manufacturing machines 
face the challenge of integrating production decision aids that are adapted to the constraints associated with dry 
machining processes. This tool has a direct impact on productivity and the quality of the final product by helping to 
determine the most suitable production parameters for dry machining. The proposed study developed an economic 
production strategy that considers several parameters related to the production process and manufacturing system 
environment simultaneously. In fact, our goal is to minimize the total cost, including raw materials, production, 
recycling, and energy consumption costs. We consider two types of raw materials, Steel and Aluminum, and a random 
demand over a finite horizon dissociated into equal periods. A model has been developed to express the objective 
function, total cost, based on variable decisions. A numerical solving procedure and example are provided to 
demonstrate the model.

Figure 4. Evolution of production quantities according to 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 
 
It is evident that an increase in the storage cost of Aluminum parts results in a decrease in the quantities produced over 
the planning horizon. This is a logical outcome as fewer parts will be stored. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Our challenge in the proposed study is to find an economic production plan that takes into account the dry machining 
production process, from the raw material selection step to the quality of the final product. In fact, we propose that we 
have to satisfy a random demand distributed over periods in a finite horizon. It is possible to satisfy the demand by 
using one of two types of raw material (Aluminum and Steel), which differ in terms of their physical characteristics. 
This difference has an impact on several economic and technical aspects, such as the cost of the raw material, the 
stocks of the finished product, the recycling costs, the cutting speed and the energy consumption. It is easy to see that 
there is a relationship between these aspects. The impact of these aspects and their relationship are taken into account 
when drawing up an economic plan. The production plan is based on the best combination between the two types of 
raw materials (Aluminum and Steel); that is, we determine the duration of two sub-periods. (for Aluminum  
∆𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝) and for Steel ∆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑝𝑝) for each period over the finite horizon. These sub-periods are determined by minimizing 
a total cost integrating production, energy consumption, inventory and raw material acquisition. A numerical example 
is developed to prove the developed mathematical model.

Abstract 
Within the dynamic landscape of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, a food company encountered 
challenges associated with fluctuating demand forecasting, resulting in inefficiencies in determining production 
volumes for various product formats. The paper outlined a comprehensive methodology applied to tackle these 
challenges, it incorporated the use of exponential smoothing (specifically Holt-Winters’ additive with dampening) and 
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, alongside a combination method to enhance forecast 
reliability. Forecasting models were evaluated through residual diagnostics and performance metrics such as root mean 
squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The report delved into prediction intervals and 
scenario-based forecasting, and it provided a holistic perspective on managing forecast uncertainty. To sustain 
enhanced forecasting, tracking signals were employed to detect persistent bias. In production planning, this paper 
assessed line utilization based on forecasted data. Results indicate that the combination of ARIMA yielded the best 
performance with a MAPE of 3.75%. Additionally, over three years, line utilization averaged 94% in normal states, 
emphasizing the effectiveness of the forecasting methods in production planning. Furthermore, the paper recommends 
the ongoing use of the ARIMA combination method and emphasizes the incorporation of tracking signals for model 
validation to enhance accuracy and reliability. Looking ahead, the paper suggests considering an expansion in the five-
year plan, aligning production capabilities with forecasted demand to further optimize operational efficiency in the 
FMCG industry. The proposed model sets the stage for sustained efficiency and strategic growth in the ever-evolving 
FMCG landscape.

1. Introduction
With a focus on a food company, this article explores the necessity of improved forecasting for FMCG (fast-moving 
consumer goods) after Covid-19. The study is important because precise forecasting has a significant impact on 
production planning, which is a tactical requirement for businesses navigating volatile markets. The difficulties the 
food firm is facing highlight the critical need for an advanced forecasting model, especially in light of demand 
variations and uncertainty. The articles' goals are to greatly increase prediction accuracy, from choosing the best 
forecasting model to comparing historical and predicted data. A strategic advantage may be gained in the FMCG 
market, which is marked by ongoing demand volatility, by efficient forecast and planning. The research's conclusions 
can completely transform the way the industry plans and allocates resources by providing a comprehensive answer to 
the problems caused by erratic market dynamics. In addition, the study tackles the pragmatic obstacles encountered 
by the company, which is observing a surge in chip sales despite contending with manufacturing limitations and 
recurrent shortages. It is warranted to shift toward an automated R programming language forecasting solution due to 
the shortcomings of the existing human Excel-based method. The research solves the problems with manual

5.7 Capacity Expansion: Line Utilization and Annual Growth Rate (AGR) 
The overall annual demand for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025 doesn’t exceed the annual production rate, as shown 
in Table 7. The annual utilization rate for these years stands below 100%, reflecting the capacity of the production 
facility to meet the forecasted demand efficiently.

5.8 Proposed Improvements 
The team recommends using the proposed method, a combination of ARIMA that enhances accuracy by merging 
various model forecasts, resulting in minimizing errors to achieve 3.75%. In addition, use scenario-based forecasts 
due to the nature of long-term predictions. By evaluating multiple scenarios, firms can better prepare for uncertainty 
while mitigating associated risks.  Furthermore, monitor the forecasting process monthly using the provided tracking 
signal as the base to confirm the model's validity. Optimize the production plan, which involves aligning forecasted 
demand with line utilization and determining ideal production volumes and schedules for different product formats. 
Consider an expansion in the five-year plan due to positive growth in demand while having 94% utilization in the 
normal state, which would result in a bottleneck in production after three years. 
 
5.9 Validation 
The forecast residuals' three-year correlogram plot shown in Figure 8 primarily stays inside the confidence intervals, 
proving that there is no discernible autocorrelation in the residuals, which indicates that the model has mostly caught 
the underlying structures in the data, indicating its predicting reliability. The distribution of the total forecast residuals 
over three years is shown by the histogram in Figure 8. The concentration of residuals close to zero highlights the 
model's overall dependability. The validity of the prediction intervals obtained from the model is further supported by 
this normal distribution.

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this paper worked toward enhancing the forecasting processes for FMCG after Covid-19, improving 
demand planning, a crucial pillar of the operation department of any firm in today's competitive market, and the 
advantages that can be obtained from having a good demand plan are enormous. A tidy forecasting workflow 
methodology was implemented to address the current state and produce a better forecasting process. Several different 
forecasting methods were evaluated. Accordingly, the method that got the most accurate forecast is the combination 
ARIMA, and it was a better fit for the data in both MAPE and RMSE. Moreover, the tracking signal with ±3.75 MAD

control limits showed that the forecast is in process. Furthermore, looking at utilization, we can see the annual 
utilization for the standard scenario is less than a hundred, with 94% as the highest value in the last year. The project 
objective was achieved, including determining the best forecasting model and developing a monitoring process for 
forecasting through tracking signals, assessing the capacity over the next three years, and determining the need for 
expansion through utilization.

Abstract  
This study aimed to understand the sentiments surrounding the use of Generative AI (GenAI) for digital cost 
management in UK construction businesses by investigating the ethical, technical, market entry, and operational 
requirements of GenAI in this context. Using a qualitative approach, a multiple case study research strategy was 
employed, involving micro, small, and large construction organisations. Sentiment analysis, a branch of natural 
language processing, was utilised in the analyses. Thus, insights into participants' emotional undertones and opinions 
were extracted. The study involved four case studies with nine participants from micro, small, large, and academic 
organisations. These participants provided insights into the ethical considerations, regulations, maintenance, and 
operations of a GenAI platform for digital cost management. The study found a need for a balanced approach to ethics, 
emphasising transparency and regulatory compliance. Market entry, adaptability, regulatory compliance, and 
affordability were identified as key factors influencing the adoption of GenAI tools. The technical operations theme 
revealed a positive sentiment towards the operational benefits of GenAI, such as improved efficiency and decision-
making, but also emphasised the need for professional oversight. Operational challenges included workforce training 
and quality assurance. The implications of these findings are significant for the adoption of BIM and GenAI in the 
construction sector, especially among SMEs. The integration of GenAI with digital cost management has the potential 
to revolutionise construction operations. Hence offering enhanced efficiency and collaboration. Perceived complexity 
and initial investment are barriers that must be addressed before implementing GenAI for digital cost through BIM.

1. Introduction
The construction industry's digital transformation has not enhanced cost management practices. Building Information 
Modelling (BIM) has offered a transformative approach to the design, construction, and management of built assets 
(Sepasgozar et al., 2022). BIM's integration with the lean construction concept has been identified as a significant 
factor in cost control for construction projects. Sepasgozar et al. (2022) emphasised the importance of this integration,

Consequently, the accuracy of costs produced through GenAI was draw some concerns. However, cost Generated 
through AI must be used as a predictive subject to professional judgement. Operational challenges include the need 
for workforce training and quality assurance in implementing GenAI. The focus on confidentiality, profitability, and 
competitive advantage indicates an understanding of the operational benefits of GenAI in enhancing business 
competitiveness. While integrating BIM for cost management and GenAI holds immense potential for the construction 
sector, especially for SMEs, overcoming barriers such as perceived complexity, initial investment, and the need for 
skilled personnel is crucial. The construction industry's future hinges on the effective adoption and implementation of 
these technologies, requiring a concerted effort from industry stakeholders, policymakers, and academia to ensure 
SMEs remain competitive and resilient.

Design and Fabrication of Multi-functional Fixture with 
Experimental Case Studies

Abstract 
A general practice in manufacturing industry, especially in machine shops, is to design and develop a dedicated jig or 
fixture for a single operation. The scope of dedicated fixturing has become challenging due to the need of 
improvisation of adjustability as well as to incorporate a range of production operations. Usually, few machining 
operations are performed on conventional fixtures i.e. vices for the rectangular work parts, and additional attachments 
are used to incorporate cylindrical work which increase the workholding time, the cost as well as the limitation of 
variability of dimensions. Furthermore, if the size of the work is small (slender or thin sheets) then it imposes the 
difficulty in fixturing. To perform several manufacturing operations (machining, joining, and welding etc.) on 
prismatic as well as cylindrical parts, each operation needs to have a dedicated fixture which may not be useable for 
a new part or the part with varying dimensions. These fixturing issues are addressed through the use of modular kits 
or custom CNC machined. There are many simple applications, especially in case of light duty manufacturing 
operations like riveting, adhesive bonding, and inspection of machined features etc. In simple applications the use of 
modular kits and specialized fixtures are not the preferred choice with respect to economic reasons. Therefore, a multi-
purpose fixture has been designed and presented in this study. The fixture design is verified through the fabrication of 
its parts and their assembly. The applicability and repeatability of the multi-functional fixture is validated through 
different experimental case studies including the inspection of hole quality, examination of microstructure through 
mini-microscope, drilling, and milling operations.

1. Introductions
Modern industry is progressing towards automation to achieve high level of productivity. Jigs and fixtures have been 
important elements in manufacturing owing to have large list of needs and benefits. A well-designed jig and/or fixture 
augment the manufacturing processes in several aspects such as increase in production, process cost reduction, 
interchangeability, reduction in inspection (as quality control is expensive), declining the rate of accidents (as safety 
measures are improvised), easy machining of complex parts, and automation of machine tool etc. In addition to other 
cost components the overall manufacturing cost also includes the cost of designing and development of fixtures. 
Inspection and quality control related expenses adds up further in the cost calculations. 
Fixtures are one of the integral parts in almost every type of conventional machining processes and some other 
manufacturing processes. The main purpose in machining is to securely hold and clamp the job and withstand the 
mechanical forces and vibrations produced during the machining operations. The researchers (Rashid and Mihai 
Nicolescu, 2006) developed fixture to control the vibrations caused under heavy mechanical forces of milling. 
Facilitation and reduction in time for loading and unloading the work parts is also required to be incorporated while

4.3 Milling Operations 
The fixture was also validated on CNC Milling Center by performing milling operation on rectangular workpiece. The 
face milling was performed on rectangular workpiece by clamping it and locating it with the locator. Alignment was 
ensured by adjusting the screw on the desired position as the case is shown in Figure 14.  
 
 
 
Figure 14. The use of fixture to perform milling operations 
 
4.4 Friction Stir Welding 
The fixture was also tested to validate its ability to be used in friction stir welding. In friction stir welding, the applied 
forces are comparatively low as compared to the milling operation. In the experimental evaluation of the fixture, 
milling as well as friction stir welding was performed to evaluate the clamping as well as repeatability of the parts 
position. The arrangement of two parts to be friction stir welded primarily required the accurate position and location 
in the fixture. The designed multi-functional fixture allowed to locate and position the two parts accurately and in less 
time. The clamping forces are enough to hold the workpiece to resist the vertical as well as rotational forces of milling 
and friction stir welding. 
 
4.5 Light Duty Manufacturing Operations 
There are several light duty manufacturing operations wherein the only requirement is to position, location and hold 
the work parts at accurate locations. There are no heavy mechanical forces. Such as adhesive bonding, painting, gluing, 
spraying, assembly, fastening, nailing, bolting, reviting, and quality inspection operations etc. are some example of 
light duty manufacturing operations where the mechanical forces are way less than the forces experienced in 
machining processes. Thus the designed fixture in this research has the potential to be effectively used in variety of 
light duty manufacturing processes. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The aim of this design oriented research is to address the need and use of a multi-purpose fixture. Based on the fixture 
design, fabrication, analysis of degree of freedom, the application areas of the fixture, and validation through 
experimental case studies, the following conclusions can be inferred: 
1. The fixture can be used to appropriately locate, position, and/or clamp variety of workpiece forms and sizes 
such as circular and non-circular profiled parts (square, rectangular, triangular, hexagonal, and other 
polygons). 
2. The designed fixture can be manufactured through conventional machining processes and with the use of 
standards fasteners. 
3. The fixture offers all the required degrees of freedom (along all the three Cartesian axis as well as rotation) 
to locate, position, and clamp the work parts. 
4. The fixture can be used for variety of manufacturing, machining, and quality inspection processes such as: 
 
Milling operations including side milling, slab milling, and face milling 
 
Drilling and boring operations to machine holes in cylindrical as well as non-cylindrical parts

Abstract 
Introduction: Interventional radiology procedures conducted on a daily basis in orthopedic operating theaters often 
fail to provide adequate protection for those involved. Issues and Objectives: The case of Mr. ZR, a 40-year-old 
anesthetist working in the orthopedic block, has raised concerns about potential health risks associated with prolonged 
exposure to ionizing radiation sources (IR). Although this risk is not explicitly listed as an occupational hazard in 
Table 6, we believe that a comprehensive survey is necessary to assess exposure levels and identify any similar cases. 
Method: Our investigation involved a two-fold approach, consisting of a desk study that analyzed the activities in the 
orthopedic block, and an exceptional periodic survey of all staff members who were exposed to IR in the operating 
theaters. Results: The survey revealed that surgical staff were at risk of IR exposure due to the use of the ""scopy"" in 
surgical procedures. Personal protective measures were insufficient, as the number of exposed caregivers outweighed 
the measures that were in place. Furthermore, other protective measures were notably absent. The medical 
examinations of the operating room staff showed that 65% of them had pathologies commonly associated with IR 
exposure, including hypochromic microcytic anemia, thrombocytosis, thyroiditis, nodular thyroid gland, and a case 
of bilateral cataract. One anesthetist was even diagnosed with thyroid cancer, which prompted this analysis. 
Conclusion: Establishing a definitive causal relationship between the encountered pathologies and the emitted IR in 
the orthopedic block presents significant challenges. Nonetheless, our investigation highlights the importance of 
conducting comprehensive surveys to assess the potential risks associated with IR exposure in orthopedic operating 
theaters.

Abstract 
PMBOK is a globally widely used guideline for project management. The release of the last version of this framework 
(the seventh edition) has been motivated by the rapid evolution of technology, new methodologies, swift market 
transitions, and significant transformations in the professional realm. The 7th edition has been revamped to 
accommodate these dynamic shifts, aiming to foster proactivity, innovation, and agility. It encompasses various 
development methodologies, from predictive to hybrid, and offers a dedicated section on customizing approaches and 
processes. The 7th edition further expands its toolkit by including the “Models, Methods, and Artifacts” segment, 
emphasizing project outcomes and deliverables. Another relevant change in this version is the transition from a 
hierarchical decomposition of PM knowledge to a comprehensive principles-based approach comprising eight 
performance domains: stakeholders, team, life-cycle, planning, project work, delivery, measurement, and uncertainty. 
In order to assess the structure and interrelationship between PMBOK 7th components, they are modeled, measured, 
and analyzed in this paper using the Social Network Analysis (SNA) tool. SNA is a technique that supports predicting 
the structure of an entity’s group using graph theory and mathematical indicators. The results confirmed that all 
PMBOK 7th components are linked in different intensity levels. This research seeks to be a management tool for 
project managers and organizational analysts, giving quantitative support for effective organizational design and 
implementation.

1. Introduction
The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) one of the most used guidelines for project management 
worldwide (Atencio et al. 2022). The 7th edition of PMBOK include a range of development methodologies, spanning 
from traditional predictive methods to more contemporary hybrid models. It introduces a specialized section focused 
on tailoring approaches and processes to suit specific project needs. Moreover, this edition expands its toolkit with the

Figure Figure 6 (3) presents the clustering coefficient where can be observed that 69.45% of nodes have a zero value, 
meaning low degree of clustering. Finally, Figure 6 (4), shows the Eccentricity metric which relates to the minimum 
steps required for any node with a maximum value equal to the network's diameter (value equal to 13). 32.39% have 
a value equal to zero. 
 
In order to conclude, Table 5 summarizes the metrics obtained for the network. The value equal to 0.004 indicates that 
the nodes are now cohesive and it can be identified dispersion among them. The average degree with value equal to 
2.19 reflects the average links between each network’s node. The network’s diameter equal to 13 means that one 
concept is thirteen nodes of distance to meet with others as maximum distance. The average path length indicates that 
each node requires on average 5.116 paths to meet the other node. Modularity indicates the level of connections 
between nodes conforming to a cluster. Considering a maximum value of 1, the value of 0,547 shows a medium 
density of connections into a cluster.

5. Conclusion 
The proposed model allows to understand and have a clear vision of the project management process inside the 
company and its relationships.  
 
From the network analysis performed during the creation of Artifact 1: PMBOK graph model was possible to identify 
that the planning performance domain plays an important role in project management, given that it has 138 
connections, demonstrating great influence on the other PM components. As a result, this research suggest to pay 
special attention to the planning processes during the modelling and assessment stages of the framework.  
 
Moreover, the network analysis confirmed that PMBOK7 concepts act as a system, since the metric “Connected 
components” have value equal to 1, which shows that all concepts make an interconnected block. This fact highlights 
that project management process are interconnected confirm that is crucial to a have systemic view of the company’s 
process.

Abstract 
This paper addresses the critical issue of digital transformation in the construction industry, a key component of the 
global economy and an area lagging in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies. Despite the recognized need for 
digitalization to enhance profitability and performance, small and medium construction enterprises (SMEs) face 
barriers such as lack of support, standards, awareness, high costs, and significant workflow changes. The research 
introduces a system-oriented framework based on enterprise architecture and social network analysis graph models to 
counter these challenges. This framework aids construction SMEs in assessing their current processes and determining 
the best digital solutions to meet their specific needs. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through a 
case study in a Colombian construction SME in the oil and gas sector, showing significant improvements in 
construction planning and design processes through the adoption of digital technologies. This study provides a 
practical approach for SMEs in the construction sector to navigate their digital transformation journey.

1. Introduction
Digital transformation is a worldwide topical issue of significant importance for all companies in all sectors, given 
that it changes customer relationships, internal processes, and value creation (Zaoui & Souissi 2020) by deeply 
transforming the business and operation model of the organization using breakthrough technologies (Ilin et al. 2021). 
These technologies, a feature of the Industry 4.0 concept, are designed to ensure the interaction of people and 
technologies (Ilin et al. 2021), support the growth and evolution of various fields and industries (Lu  2017), and 
enhance project performance and management success (Demirkesen & Tezel 2022).

Abstract 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 interrelated goals adopted by the United Nations (UN) for a 
better and sustainable future for all. One of the SDGs, SDG 2, relates to achieving food security, and improved 
nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. Millets are a group of small seeded grasses rich in different nutrients, 
micronutrients and minerals. Apart from many types, finger millet, pearl millet, foxtail millet, barnyard millet, proso 
millet, kodo millet, and sorghum are the most important ones grown worldwide. Millets can contribute to dietary 
diversity and promote sustainability. The objective of this research has been to identify an optimal combination of 
intake food items to satisfy the daily nutritional requirements by including millets. This research uses a modified form 
of the classic Diet problem. Using this mathematical model, an optimal combination of food items to be included in 
daily meal is found out. Apart from satisfying the nutritional need optimally, this research also takes into consideration 
to include the dietary preference of people. After solving for multiple scenarios, it has been concluded that that daily 
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) cannot be fulfilled without including millets in the meal. Millets can have 
transforming impact on the nutritional intake of people and they can be highly beneficial in combating dietary nutrient 
deficiency.

1. Introduction
Millet are small-seeded grasses, which have a usage history spanning thousands of years. Millets are classified into 
major and minor millets. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), and finger millet (Eleusine 
coracana) are the major millets. Besides major millets, there are numerous minor millets available locally in various 
regions of the world.  
Millets have been regarded as a dietary staple in numerous regions across Africa and Asia. They are now gaining 
widespread acknowledgment globally due to their remarkable health advantages and adaptability in contemporary 
diets. These grains are nutrient powerhouses, containing vital elements like iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus,

From Figure 1, it can be observed that even in the best possible scenario, the amount of millets to be included in the 
optimal daily basket comes out to be at least 1400 g. If the quantity of millets is reduced further, then the models gives 
an infeasible solution. Whereas, Table 4 and Table 5 provide an overview of the composition of the food basket, and 
recommended consumption quantity of food items respectively, in the optimal scenario considering consumer 
preferences. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Millets have huge potential for improving the nutrition quotient of food intake while simultaneously being sustainable 
to produce. The model was used to identify the optimal combination of food items to be included in daily meals so 
that RDA values are met successfully. However, with the acceptance of such a combination of food items, it is 
important to prepare palatable meals using that combination. To be able to do that, more food items as per the 
availability and preferences of consumers can be added in the model. Consideration of more food items in the food 
basket can lead to a more acceptable combination. Another possibility is to explore the optimality of the solution for 
different time frames. There is a possibility to use the results of this research for planning government programs for 
the eradication of malnutrition and ensuring nutrition amongst vulnerable populations in various parts of the world.

Risk Profile Classification and Premiums Estimation in 
Property Lines Insurance: A Multinomial Regression 
Approach 
Reem Adel Abdallah 
Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management 
University of Sharjah 
Sharjah 27272, United Arab Emirates 
Abstract 
The notion of risk exists in every aspect of the business, as it cannot be eliminated but rather reduced to an attainable 
level through the utilization of effective risk management techniques. For the insurance industry in particular, risk is 
traded and transferred to the insurance providers as the company offers a shield from the exposure to risk consequences 
and the likelihood of loss, therefore, escalating the risk from the insured entity to the insurer for a given premium. 
This research is a development on a previously published paper by the author which had focused on the same issue 
but with the utilization of binary regression. The paper now proposes a modern model to risk classification which will 
be used for property lines insurance. The significance of the research lies in the fact that the process of risk prediction 
can be extremely complex since there are many parameters to keep in mind.  In addition, accurate premium pricing 
can be difficult to estimate given the unpredictability of the risks occurring to the covered property. The data will be 
categorized into “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D” using multinomial regression followed by a pricing model. The proposed 
model will be validated via data collected from surveyed properties of a UAE based insurance company. The model 
is expected to serve as a tool that helps provide better estimates of risk, premiums, and precise pricing.

1. Introduction
The notion of risk differs from an industry to another, for this paper, the focal point will be risks in the financial 
industry as it describes the volatility and variances in the outcomes of business strategies and trades. According to 
Khandelwal et al. (2019), organizations are presented with a choice when faced with risky decisions: they can choose 
to take the risk by getting more involved or avoid it by doing nothing new. Risks can originate from a variety of 
sources, including sovereign, business, insurance, and liquidity risk. Because these risks can all affect the organization, 
it's critical to manage them well (Anton & Nucu, 2020). In order to categorize risks and determine insurance policy 
prices, this study will focus in particular on risk in insurance and explore the many kinds of risk. By giving the insured 
company a financial cushion to recover losses when unforeseen circumstances arise, the insurance sector assists in 
protecting organizations and enterprises from a variety of dangers that may arise on a daily basis. This is achieved by 
having the insured party pay a premium amount, where the amount is determined by various risk factors including the 
sum insured; the total amount of money in which the company is accountable to pay if a loss occurs to the covered 
property, the type of insurance coverage, the claims history along with the likelihood and size of potential losses. The 
load that is applied to the base premium varies depending on the insurance line; the higher the risk factors, the higher 
the load (Berger, 1988). Due to the numerous variables that affect the fluctuating levels of risk, insurance companies 
are continuously faced with difficulties in determining the necessary level of coverage and premiums for property

5. Results and Discussion  
The classification model revealed high accuracy and prediction power, as it accommodates the risk category and the 
highly associated variables to predict the correct category to place the property into. Furthermore, it provides the user 
with a probability for each of the four categories to illustrate the likelihood of the property being in one of the four 
categories, where the category with the highest percentage reveals that it is the best fit for the property. This is 
advantageous as it allows the company to judge the results based on some qualitative measures that further influence 
the decision made regarding the categorization.  
 
As for the estimation model, the model works as a great tool for the underwriters of the insurance company, as they 
can easily identify the right amount of premium to be given to a client to maximize the profits for providing insurance 
coverage. The output given works as a tool in decision making, while keeping in mind that they are the breakeven 
values, if the company is to insure the full property and EML amount. Moreover, the EML provided during the survey 
covers the total loss of a property and every aspect of the risk. However, in practice this is not always the case as the 
company usually covers losses from specific risks, for instance any loss occurring due to fire with exclusions, such as 
plate glass. Furthermore, the insurance providers usually set a limit to the losses to be recovered fully when occurring, 
for instance the limits for each loss occurring would be set to AED 1,000,000 despite the loss amount being more than 
that. This will reduce the premium to be paid by the insured since the insurance provider will only cover losses up to 
that specified limit. On the other hand, the company could collaborate with other insurance providers to reinsure this 
client, where the risk is split between them if the company fails to cover the EML value solely. The term reinsurance 
refers to the method used by insurance companies to transfer a percentage of the risk to another insurance provider, 
with an agreement to collaborate in paying off the amount to the client in case a loss occurs to the insured’s property. 
By doing this, insurance providers diversify their portfolio, reduce their liabilities, and the chances of paying a large 
amount of money (Park & Xie, 2014). To further illustrate the significance of this research, Table 11 showcases the 
advantages of using multinomial regression in contrast to the binary regression. This research reflects the power of 
utilizing multinomial regression, which has enhanced the power of the previous research (Abdallah, R.A & Dalalah, 
D., 2022) by adding more risk factors which replicate the actual model used in UAE based insurance companies. 
Additionally, by allocating damage factors for each category, EML has been estimated for premium pricing purposes. 
This continuation is aiming to ease the classification and pricing procedure for commercial insurers, by reducing time 
and improving accuracy while automizing the process.

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, risk is a factor that will continue to exist in every aspect of life as it cannot be excluded completely, 
especially in the business industry. However, with application of the right risk assessment techniques, it can be reduced 
to an acceptable level and have a minimal impact on the financial status of the business. The accuracy of risk predicted 
can in fact be enhanced by implementing machine learning and big data analysis (Jung et al., 2022). For the insurance 
industry, risk is often transferred from the insured client to the insurance provider for a given amount of premium that 
is specified for the respective duration of cover. Insurance companies provide a financial shield to the insured and 
transfer the liability to the company, therefore protecting the client from the likelihood and magnitude of a loss. This 
research is a continuation of a previously published paper (Abdallah, R.A & Dalalah, D., 2022) which focused on 
binary logistic regression, hence this particular paper has developed to include multinomial regression to predict and 
classify risks. Multinomial regression model has been developed for the purpose of predicting and classifying risks 
into various categories. Moreover, a new model for pricing has been suggested in this thesis for the purpose of

estimating the right amount of premium for each client. This will aid insurance companies in enhancing their risk 
prediction, attract new clients while matching their future needs, remain competitive in the market, and estimate claim 
amounts with higher accuracy.  
The main conclusions can be summarized in the following bullet points, comparing the performance of the 
multinomial regression In comparison to the previously used method (Binary regression): 
• 
The multinomial regression model demonstrated a more detailed classification by providing a probability for 
each of the four categories.   
• 
Multinominal regression was precise enough to avoid severe misclassification of risk categories and showed 
no significant errors.  
• 
The pricing model for the multinomial regression revealed high accuracy, as it allocated an expected weight 
factor for each of the four risk categories for calculating the expected loss.  
For future work, the model may be further extended to predict more than four risk categories, should the data be 
available. Nonetheless, more input parameters can be included to enhance the prediction accuracy such as credit score, 
reputation, number of commercial policies issued under the same account, and claims history.

Abstract 
Implementing lean manufacturing practices is crucial for improving operational efficiencies in diverse industries. The 
primary objective is to comprehensively analyze the implementation of lean principles within these manufacturing 
facilities. This study employs the Rapid Plant Assessment (RPA) method to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of 
operational processes. Conducting extensive visits to various KSA factories, this research assesses key aspects 
including customer satisfaction, safety standards, visual management, teamwork, equipment maintenance, supply 
chain integration, and commitment to quality. The findings reveal consistent above-average customer satisfaction and 
commendable safety standards across all factories. However, notable variations exist in teamwork and equipment 
maintenance practices among these facilities. The study highlights the necessity for targeted improvements in visual 
management, supply chain integration, and standardized practices to bolster operational efficiencies and uphold 
quality standards within Saudi Arabia's manufacturing sector.

Abstract 
The primary goal of manufacturing industries is to maximise profit. This informs their choice of suitable investment 
projects. However, the capacity and capabilities of the personnel charged with the responsibility of advising the 
organisation significantly to influence the quality and profitability of the investment project. In many manufacturing 
industries, engineers play prominent roles in the different units of the industry, including capital budgeting. But does 
their basic training, as engineers, adequately prepare them for this function? The case study research strategy was 
adopted, using mixed methods for data collection and analysis, correlating the results with suitable statistical tools. 
The findings revealed that most of the engineers in the business unit perform capital budgeting using the most 
elementary tools. To improve their proficiency, engineers require progressive training in business and financial 
studies. Therefore, the researchers recommend periodic and progressive training programmes for engineers, as well 
as integrating the engineering staff with other personnel from the business and financial professions in the business 
unit of the organisation.

1. Introduction
For many years, capital budgeting has been used as a vehicle for decision-making when choosing suitable investment 
projects for large engineering and manufacturing firms. Saxena (2015) describes capital budgeting as the process of 
making investment decisions, using suitable tools for objective analysis to guide the deployment of resources for long-
term use, and creating benefits for shareholders. The many capital budgeting tools and techniques available for the 
evaluation of investment processes include discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, accounting rate of return (ARR) 
analysis, profitability index (PI) analysis, and many more. Adopting suitable capital budgeting tools can be extremely 
useful in the decision-making process for the selection of projects when the aim is to maximise shareholder wealth. 
However, one of the major challenges that exists in the field is that engineers who function as project sponsors or 
implementors are not always sufficiently knowledgeable of the essential workings of economics and its impact on 
engineering projects (Yihui et al. 2021). Firms should seek professionals who are knowledgeable of the practices of 
capital budgeting to enable the organisation to make sound investment decisions (Michelona et al. 2020).  
Inadvertently, many investment projects are chosen or endorsed based on non-economic reasoning. Some of the 
commonly adopted approaches to project selection include the following.

Similarly, within the same margin of 0.3–0.5, the standardised Beta coefficient is considered statistically significant 
to the proficiency test (Erbaugh et al. 2017). The correlation test revealed that the possession of a business qualification 
makes the largest contribution to the dependent variable with a coefficient value of 0.457. Educational level and years 
of working experience both have coefficients close to zero and are therefore not statistically significant, as shown in

In a nutshell, the possession of an engineering qualification, without suitable business or financial qualifications and 
years of experience, has a weak correlation with proficiency in the practice of capital budgeting, as shown in both the 
Pearson correlation and the standardised Beta coefficient test. Therefore, to improve the proficiency of the engineers 
who participated in this study, the organisation should explore the prospect of progressive training of their engineering 
staff in business and financial studies. Human capacity development through training invigorates and incentivizes 
employees and not only leads to improved quality of work but also improved employee retention (Wright 2000). 
 
6. Conclusion  
Capital budgeting as an important tool for effective investment decision-making, is given considerable attention by 
manufacturing industries. The capital budgeting process is executed by the in-house personnel of an organisation or 
through an outsourced service of specialist consultants. If in-house personnel are to be used, it is imperative to ensure 
that the personnel have the capacity and capability to perform the functions adequately. Over the years, several studies 
have been done on capital budgeting practices in different industries worldwide. However, there was little focus on 
engineers performing the task of capital budgeting in manufacturing industries, especially in South Africa. Therefore, 
this research explored the understanding and use of capital budgeting practices by engineers working in a South 
African petrochemical industry.  
 
To achieve the aim and objectives of this research, appropriate questions were developed and included in the survey 
questions to elicit responses from participants. The demographic information indicated that the respondents were aptly 
qualified and had provided useful responses to the survey questions. The analysis of results and discussion of the 
research findings provided sufficient information on how the aim and objectives of the research were achieved.  
 
In conclusion, the research established that engineers in this South African petrochemical industry have a good 
understanding and use of some of the basic tools for capital budgeting but do not possess the required proficiency for 
the use of the technically complex tools most suitable for investment decisions. However, they seem comfortable with 
the use of the NPV, IRR and payback period methods and have the potential to improve their proficiency in the use 
of multiple or complex tools through short- to medium-term training sessions. This was true for personnel with 
business and finance qualifications who work alongside these engineers in the same unit or recirculate the engineers 
around other units in the industry.  
 
As this research was conducted in one unit of a petrochemical industry in South Africa, the research findings cannot 
be adopted for general use without appropriate contextualisation. Therefore, this research recommends that this 
exercise should be expanded to cover more units in the same industry and include other petrochemical industries in 
South Africa to elicit more information for wider use in the Southern African sub-region. To improve their proficiency, 
engineers require progressive training in business and financial studies. The researchers consequently recommend 
periodic and progressive training programmes for the engineers, as well as providing the staff with other training from

the business and financial professions’ in the business unit of the organisation. Similarly, it is recommended that the 
teaching of capital budgeting techniques should be included in the academic training curriculum of engineering 
institutions.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of sales and operations planning processes on production 
operational efficiency at the organization. The objective of the paper was to examine the extent to which sales and 
operations planning practices enhance efficiency, the relationship between operations performance and sales planning, 
and how sales and operations planning can assist the organization in addressing factors that lead to ineffective 
efficiency. A quantitative research technique was used to collect data for this research, the data was analysed using a 
descriptive method. The sales and operations planning practices literature were reviewed and the results of the data 
obtained from the organization employees/participants were presented. The results of the study demonstrated that 
sales and operations planning (S&OP) incorporates all the procedures that connect the organisation's strategic goals 
with its production process. The influence of sales and operations planning procedures on operational performance 
were consistently and effectively demonstrated on the organization’s operational characteristics such as quality, 
delivery, stock, and flexibility.

1. Introduction
The introduction highlights the significance of sales and operations planning (S&OP) as a methodical procedure used 
by organizations to manage consumer demand and product availability. Notably, 70% of global manufacturers have 
adopted S&OP, emphasizing its widespread implementation, particularly among large businesses. The process 
involves cross-functional collaboration and integrates client-focused marketing tactics with logistics management, 
providing a strategic approach to maintaining a competitive advantage. 
In the context of the manufacturing organization where the study was conducted, which operates in the fresh prepared 
and convenience food industry in South Africa, the introduction stresses the company's commitment to innovation, 
quality, sustainability, and ethical practices.  
1.1 Problem Statement 
Due to increased worldwide competition, many manufacturing companies are being forced to cut costs while 
maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. South African manufacturing company experience issues such as 
customer complaints, excessive inventory, cash flow issues, unfulfilled annual organization goals, imbalances in 
supply and demand. It is well known that when demand exceeds supply, the production organization may struggle to 
offer the desired volume, which can affect service delivery. Alternatively, if supply exceeds demand, stockpiles may 
rise, resulting in reduced output, plant closures, and layoffs, lowering the organization’s competitiveness. Sales and

7. Conclusion 
Manufacturing organizations utilizing sales and operations planning (S&OP) processes often face challenges by 
overcomplicating the process, especially regarding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Attempting to monitor 
numerous aspects of supply and demand may render planning ineffective, leading to oversight of departmental 
visibility. Instead, organizations should focus on identifying crucial KPIs that genuinely assess the collaboration and 
performance of various departments. S&OP is a continuous process that relies on learning from past failures, 
emphasizing the need for comprehensive documentation of previous plans and practices.Cross-organizational 
collaboration forms the foundation of successful sales and operations planning. Involving stakeholders from all aspects 
of the business during the planning stage is essential for effectiveness. Neglecting divisions like operations and finance 
while prioritizing only the sales department can undermine the utility of the S&OP process. Investing in S&OP 
resources facilitates accurate alignment of demand and supply aspects, fostering a cohesive and productive 
organizational environment. 
 
The study had four research objectives. The first objective aimed to assess the impact of sales and operations planning 
practices on operational performance. The findings indicated that these practices contribute significantly to managing 
consumer demand and maintaining operational capabilities, providing a consistent set of numbers for strategic, 
tactical, and operational planning. Notable benefits included improved labour productivity, service delivery, reduced 
material costs, fixed cost optimization, enhanced promotional effectiveness, and finished goods inventory reduction. 
The second objective sought to establish the relationship between operational performance and sales planning. Results 
showed a positive correlation, emphasizing the pivotal role of effective sales and operational planning in 
manufacturing operational success. Planning, especially through sales and operations planning, enables organizations 
to assess their market position and proactively address supply chain and demand issues. 
 
The third objective aimed to identify factors leading to poor operational performance and how sales and operations 
planning practices address these issues. Findings underscored that inadequate production procedures, redundancy, 
poor planning, complicated processes, and inefficient resource allocation contribute to poor performance. Sales and 
operations planning enhances internal visibility, enabling better product management, promotion scheduling, and 
inventory control. It mitigates inefficiencies stemming from wasted resources, overproduction, and suboptimal 
customer service. 
The fourth objective focused on making recommendations based on sales and operations planning processes to 
enhance organizational efficiency and effectiveness. Recommendations included regularly reviewing organizational 
performance against business goals, involving input from all levels, prioritizing improvement areas, and developing 
action plans with deadlines. The study emphasized the necessity of patience in mastering sales and operations planning 
for consistent growth, development, and stability.

Abstract  
The purpose of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of the existing research regarding warehouse operation 
specifically storage policies. Warehouse operations are critical factors that affect the responsiveness of the supply 
chain. To meet customer demand on time, optimizing warehouse operations is critical to enhance the overall supply 
chain performance. Storage policy is critical in warehouse operations, directly impacting order fulfillment efficiency, 
lead times, and space utilization.  The main objective of this study is to determine the effect of storage policies on the 
utilization of the warehouse, lead times, and overall operations of the warehouse.  Hence, this paper examines the 
existing storage policies, types of simulation modeling that would aid in creating a simulation model that mimics 
warehouse operations for testing purposes.

Storage Policy, Stock Keeping Unit, Turnover Ratio, Lean, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). 
1. Introduction
Warehouses are the heart of the supply chain, and many aspects are highly dependent on them. To better serve 
customers and ensure their satisfaction, products must be delivered on time and up to the expected quality. Thus, 
the warehouse operations must be optimized, including the warehouse layout, picking, and routing processes.

al., 2013).  Lean techniques can be utilized to increase the utilization of the warehouse, its operations, and resources; 
with the motion being recognized as a form of waste, it is often abundantly identified in warehouses from the receiving 
process up until the shipping process  (Gopakumar et al., 2008).  
 
Value Stream mapping consists of two diagrams, current and future state. The current state is the initial or current 
state at any facility, which is used to identify waste, redundant steps, and waiting times. It allows visualization of the 
process in order to capture the essentials from the trivial processes/steps. After waste is identified and eliminated 
through the various techniques and tools used to eliminate waste and enhance operations, the future state map is 
created to recognize the improvement to the system/process visually (Chen et al., 2013). 
In a study by Chen et al. in a distribution center, lean has been integrated with the use of RFID to improve the system's 
productivity.  The storage policy of the warehouse has been adjusted to dedicated rather than random, with products 
having the highest turnover rate being placed closest to the input/output point of the warehouse. Improvements were 
made to the receiving, storage, packing, and shipping processes. The receiving process had an 81% improvement in 
the value-added time, while the storage, packing, and shipping showed 95%,60%, and 99% improvement, 
respectively. With the integration of lean and RFID, the overall operations of the warehouse can save up to 87% (Chen 
et al., 2013). 
 
3. Conclusion 
After a deep investigation into warehouse management and storage policies, the following research concluded that 
the policy relies on choice. Therefore, the storage policy deployed must align with its specific objectives, 
requirements, and costs. To best utilize warehouse operations, the automation of processes enhances the performance, 
resulting in the overall improvement of the supply chain performance. Creating a simulation model that represents a 
warehouse and its various processes is valuable for testing different storage policies and assessing their impact on 
operations, lead times, and utilization of employees. The processes imitated and the outcome expected will determine 
the best-fit simulation type and receive effective results.

Abstract 
This study investigates the effect of sitting posture on the back health of students involved in remote work. Jack® 
human simulation software was employed to measure the impact of different seated postures on the lower back region, 
specifically the lumbar spine. The analysis focused on common positions adopted during extended work periods: 
neutral (Posture 1), flexion (Posture 2) and extension (Posture 3). Three tests were conducted in the simulated 
environment to predict the forces exerted on the musculoskeletal system, which are Lower back analysis (LBA), 
Comfort Analysis, and Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS). The results revealed that Posture 2 
exhibited the highest compression force and is the least comfortable in terms of joint angles compared to the other 
postures while posture 3 is the least comfortable in terms of body parts. Furthermore, the musculoskeletal loading 
associated with working in postures 2 and 3 does not reach excessive levels, however it is required to provide 
ergonomic improvements. This paper also proposes strategies to enhance the working postures of university students.

university students, such as the smart moving project (Helten & Shaker Verlag, 2022) implemented in a German 
university. The model incorporated tools such as online active breaks (Heller et al., 2023).  In fact, in (Heller et al., 
2023) approach, they created an intervention that incorporates short videos inserted in online lectures. Such systems 
can be implemented nationally (UAE) and internationally with customizable packages that better suit the schedules 
of the universities.   
 
6. Conclusion  
In summary, this study successfully achieved its objectives of measuring and analysing the effects of various sitting 
postures usually observed among students working from home. The investigation utilized Jack® human simulation 
software to assess the impact of different seated positions on the lower back muscles. The findings notably highlighted 
Posture 2 (flexion) as having the largest L4/L5 forces and highest discomfort levels, despite being the most observed 
posture by students. Moreover, sitting in a posture with forward or backward bend may cause harmful effects on the 
spine alignment. Lastly, evidence-based recommendations to improve the ergonomic aspects of remote learning 
environments have been formulated based on the study's outcomes.

Abstract 
Hybrid Flow Shop Sequence Dependent Group Scheduling (HFSDGS) problems gathered much attention from 
researchers in recent years. But, the combination of blocking constraints and Group Technology (GT) principles in 
the Hybrid Flow Shop (HFS) configuration has not been extensively treated by academics as it must. In the present 
work, we aim to contribute to the HFSDGS literature through two new Mixed Integer Linear Programming 
(MILP) models for minimizing makespan of the blocking HFSDGS problem. Also we define two new constraint 
programming (CP) based models. Experimental studies are conducted in our studies to compare the performances 
of the new models with other models dealing with the same problem. When dealing with problems with small 
sizes, the CP models show some promising results so we intend to extend the studies to medium and large sizes 
instances. Whenever grouping technologies GT principles are applied in scheduling activities, a Group Scheduling 
(GS) problem arises. So we consider both sub-problems: arrangement of groups and the arrangement of jobs 
within the group. Jobs belonging to the same group are processed on the same machine sequentially with no 
interruption by jobs of other groups. A setup is required each time we switch from one group to the next one. Since 
the flow shop has no intermediate buffers, the blocking constraints arise:  a job, which is completed the processing 
of its operation on one machine, cannot leave it until the next machine belonging to the next stage is idle. The 
objective is to minimize the completion time of the last job belonging to the last group of the sequence.

Abstract 
The paper examines the promotional factors of collaborative resource sharing (CRS) in the pharmaceutical industry 
during disruption. The pharmaceutical industry remains the backbone of the health sector as it supports activities of 
hospitals and care-homes in terms of drug manufacturing and production of health care facilities. Based on the 
significance of this industry, the need to promote faster recovery strategies such as CRS to help pharmaceutical 
industry recover quickly during disruption like COVID-19 is paramount. The paper adopts exploratory analysis and 
descriptive methodologies to delineate responses garnered from sampled professionals, practitioners and experts in 
the pharmaceutical industry. The paper finds that increased efficiency, risk reduction, and sharing of transient 
knowledge, among others are general factors that promote the application of CRS strategy in disruption. Also, the 
paper confirms that trust, commitment, incentives and continuous innovation are promotional factors of CRS in the 
pharmaceutical industry in both normal and disruptive periods. It concludes that promotional factors of collaborative 
resources sharing are multifaceted, and those factors that are instrumental to reducing the impact of disruption are 
more conventional than those factors to consider during normalcy. The paper recommends continuous innovation and 
creation of intermediating elements for successful implementation of CRS in the pharmaceutical industry.

Abstract 
Health economic studies for making decisions on disease management interventions usually focus on evaluating cost-
effectiveness or net monetary benefits of the interventions. But there can be other societal benefits of these 
interventions which can motivate policymakers to adopt them. Our disease of interest is Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection, which causes more deaths than HIV infection in India. In advanced stages, the only cure is liver 
transplantation whose costs are more than ten times of India’s annual per-capita income. Indian Punjab has a high 
HCV prevalence of 3.6% and is also struggling with the menace of injecting drug use which is a major contributor to 
HCV spread. In early stages of HCV infection, injecting drug users (IDUs) might not know of their infection status; 
thus, increasing screening and treatment uptake can lead to more IDUs leaving the practice. Nearly 75% of the 
injecting drug users in Punjab are below 30 years of age, and as most people in the state are also below this age, the 
risk of infection in young people becomes a concern for economic productivity and life expectancy- the latter becomes 
enhanced for young individuals as HCV is a slowly progressing disease and while the lifespans of older people are 
not expected to be affected significantly, reduction in the lifespans of younger people can be significant if not treated. 
The most effective standard-of-treatment is directly-acting antivirals (DAAs). Models assessing impacts of DAAs in 
the Indian context have neither incorporated HCV transmission nor evaluated impacts on important societal 
parameters like age structure of infected patients, IDU prevalence, contribution of HCV to overall mortality and liver 
transplants needed. We developed an agent-based simulation for modelling HCV transmission in an open cohort. We 
modelled disease progression using a widely used discrete-time Markov chain. The model was calibrated and validated 
after execution over a fifty-year period; then we added a treatment component where infected individuals were treated 
at the end of every year for a ten-year period to achieve a targeted treatment uptake rate. The experiments were carried 
out for five uptake rates- 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% of all infected agents. By increasing the uptake rate from 
10% to 90%, we observed the following trends in parameter estimates (reported as means of three replications, with 
respective standard deviations inside parentheses):

A Systematic Literature Review: Exploring Healthcare 
Supply Chain Risk Management, Resiliency and Future 
Research Implications

Abstract 
This paper reports the findings of a systematic literature review examining supply chain risk management (SCRM) 
and resilience in healthcare supply chains. The review used thematic analysis (manually constructed themes with the 
help of each article's highlights to identify shared insights and trends across the literature.)to identify trends and gaps 
within the existing literature. The findings reveal three critical research gaps in the literature. Firstly, there needs to 
be more research on rural healthcare supply chains despite ample studies on innovations and data sharing for enhancing 
supply chain resilience. This underscores a research gap in understanding the unique challenges rural healthcare 
settings face. Secondly, the potential of A.I. algorithm-based systems in enhancing supply chain resilience in 
healthcare remains underexplored, indicating a need to explore the role of A.I. in healthcare supply chains. Finally, 
integrating supply chain management with Lean Six Sigma practices for enhancing supply chain resilience requires 
more research for broader industry applications despite its theoretical importance. The study also identified vital 
thematic areas crucial to enhancing supply chain resilience in healthcare settings, such as technology, innovation, data 
sharing, Lean Six Sigma, supply chain management, and A.I. algorithm-based systems. Identifying these themes 
provides a foundation for future research and practical implications for healthcare organizations to adapt to unexpected 
disruptions and improve their supply chain resilience.

1. Introduction
Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is an evolving field that has gained much attention over the years. Since its 
emergence in the early 2000s, significant contributions, such as Norrman and Jansson's seminal work in 2004, have 
extensively defined SCRM and proposed measures for identifying and mitigating supply chain risks (SCRs). However, 
the term ""resilience"" has several meanings and changes based on the topic or industry. In the supply chain industry, 
particularly healthcare, resilience involves delivering products as expected despite unexpected disruptions (Bahadori 
et al., 2017; Polater & Demirdogen, 2018). This resilience is an integral part of risk management. A resilient healthcare 
supply chain can withstand disruptions, adapt quickly to changing circumstances, and recover rapidly from unexpected 
events. However,. In the last few years until COVID-19, despite valuable insights provided by such studies on the 
healthcare supply chain risk management, these studies have had limited scope in effectively discussing overall 
resilience and immunity within the supply chain risk management ecosystem of healthcare. 
However, the COVID-19 pandemic called attention to the need for overall resilience in healthcare supply chain risk 
management. In the recent articles, the pandemic emerged as an unforeseen and perilous development in 2020, 
significantly challenging the healthcare system and disrupting supply chains  (Ivanov, 2020 & Senna et al., 2021).

5.3 Validation  
The validation of the paper included rigorous methodology, a systematic approach, and careful supervision to ensure 
the quality and reliability of the research findings. The paper was authored by a student under the guidance of a 
knowledgeable professor, providing additional supervision and feedback during critical stages of the review process. 
The reliability of the inclusion and exclusion criteria was ensured through comprehensive search strategies across 
multiple databases. The selection and screening of articles were conducted independently and validated by the guiding 
professor to guarantee consistency and accuracy. The selected articles were critically analyzed and evaluated based 
on their relevance, quality, and contribution to the research topic. In conclusion, the validation process of the paper 
was conducted with a high level of rigour and accuracy, drawing on reputable journals' peer-review processes and 
extensive quality checks to ensure the research's validity. 
 
6. Conclusion  
 After an in-depth analysis of the existing literature on SCRM and its resiliency, and through a constructed thematic 
analysis, this research concludes that while considerable research work has been performed on technology, innovation, 
and data sharing and visibility, mostly led in urban areas; limited articles investigate the H.C. of rural areas. Despite 
the involvement of technology in healthcare supply chains, there is still a lack of detailed research on the role of A.I. 
algorithm-based systems in H.C. Moreover, while there is significant research on the benefits of supply chain 
management and Lean Six Sigma separately, there is limited research exploring how integrating these two 
management practices can improve the resilience of supply chains in the healthcare industry. Consequently, the 
potential of supply chain-lean Six Sigma practices to enhance supply chain resilience in healthcare is yet to be well-
documented in research articles. 
 
Future research should focus on filling these gaps in knowledge. There is a need to explore how AI-based systems can 
contribute to improving SCRM resiliency, especially in rural areas that could benefit from cost-effective and 
innovative technology solutions. There is also a need to explore the potential of integrating supply chain management 
and lean Six Sigma principles as a way to improve the resilience of healthcare supply chains, optimize their operations 
in the face of unexpected disruptions, and improve overall healthcare outcomes. Addressing these gaps in research 
could lead to the development of innovative and effective strategies for healthcare organizations to mitigate risks, 
improve SCRM resiliency, and prepare for unexpected disruptions like COVID-19, enhancing the resilience of 
healthcare supply chains in the long run.

Abstract 
The domino effect in the oil and gas industry can be attributed to the persistent need to store, transport, and process 
hazardous materials in equipment or storage facilities in close proximity to optimize operational efficiency and 
economic viability. Natural occurrences, such as floods, earthquakes, and typhoons, can also act as initiating factors 
for domino effects. In our current work, we have developed an enhanced model to optimize the allocation of safety 
barriers for stopping or delaying domino impacts in chemical plants. Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is used to 
solve the optimal barrier allocation problem. The solution approach provides information on the minimum propagation 
times of various fire paths associated with all possible accident scenarios, which is directly related to the location of 
the selected safety barriers. Furthermore, the current work introduces a pioneering approach to barrier allocation based 
on nodes rather than the traditional focus on arcs. As a case study, the developed model simulates the Shibushi Storage 
Base in Japan, comprising forty-three oil storage tanks. The model provides a fast and effective solution to allocating 
safety barriers around the storage tanks within the allocated budget constraints.

1. Introduction
In the chemical and process sectors, there is an ongoing and significant risk when it comes to fire incidents, particularly 
the activities of handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials across chemical industrial parks globally. 
The potential dangers of the escalation of an accident into a major catastrophe (representing a phenomenon called the 
domino effect) are more pronounced than ever. The term “domino effect” (also termed “knock-on effect”) refers to a 
scenario in which an event sets off a chain reaction of similar events. The general definition of the domino effect 
includes both pleasant and unpleasant occurrences. However, in the context of safety and security, it almost invariably 
accounts for an unfavorable incident that triggers a cascade of untoward incidents (or accidents). It is pertinent to 
mention that the original inadvertent or deliberate incident can propagate within the affected piece of equipment over 
time or affect the adjacent equipment simultaneously or in sequence. Most importantly, this change activates a single

5. Conclusion 
A comprehensive mathematical model is developed using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) to improve chemical 
plant safety barrier allocation, addressing the domino effect in industrial facilities. This novel model incorporates 
nodes and arcs, expanding on the classic arc-based barrier allocation technique. We used lexicographic optimization 
to minimize escalation time and analyze the sum of propagation durations for different fire pathways. This dual-
objective optimization lets decision-makers intelligently manage resources to reduce domino effects. The model’s 
capacity to provide optimum answers in an acceptable computing time makes it more applicable in real-world 
situations. The research focused on chemical facilities, but the concept may be applied to other sectors, underscoring 
its potential to improve safety in linked systems. The model will be modified to account for geometric aspects in future 
work, and more industrial experiments will be performed to enhance our technique. This study improves process 
industry safety and lays the groundwork for domino effects and safety barrier optimization studies.

Abstract 
This study focuses on the problem of multi-order fulfillment and consolidation in e-Commerce retail (MOFCP). We 
examine a retailer that operates an online channel and a network of stores or warehouses. In this context, the term” 
store” is broadly used to refer to an individual physical store or a local warehouse. Customers can place orders 
containing multiple items through on-line platforms. The goal is to find the locations that fulfill each order and a 
consolidation point of each order such that the total transportation costs are minimized. To capture the economy of 
scale of the transportation costs, we model the transportation costs through piece-wise linear cost functions. We 
propose an integer programming IP formulation enhanced by valid inequalities, as well as a nested Variable 
Neighborhood Search heuristic. Through preliminary numerical experiments, we show that the heuristic has 1.58% 
and 2.98% overall average increase in costs compared to the MILP for the case of tight inventory to demand ratio 
(𝑘𝑘= 1) and suplus inventory to demand (𝑘𝑘= 1.5) respectively. The overall average running time is about 2 times 
faster for tight inventory and about 5 times slower than the IP when inventory is surplus.

The emergence of mobile Internet and e-Commerce has had a major impact on consumer behaviour, leading to a 
preference for online shopping and providing online retailers with the opportunity to increase sales (Nguyen et al., 
2018). This shift has resulted in the global e-Commerce market reaching an estimated 5 trillion US dollars in 2022 
and is projected to continue to grow in the coming years (Statista, 2023). This increase in online sales requires 
eCommerce retailers (e-tailers) to respond effectively to customer demands. To meet this demand, online retailers are 
expanding their logistic network (Hubner et al., 2016), which has led to more complex fulfilment operations and an¨ 
increase in logistic costs (Handfield et al., 2013). To reduce these costs, e-tailers are implementing strategies such as 
reducing the frequency of delivery by the last mile and employing omnichannel approaches. 
E-tailers are challenged to maintain high service quality while reducing fulfillment expenses. When customers place
orders online, their goal is to design the most cost-effective fulfilment plans, considering operational constraints and
customer expectations (Acimovic / Graves, 2017). The time between order placement and delivery in online settings,

average relative cost increase is 1.36% for 3 orders and 3.19% for 5 orders. Additionally, the performance varies with 
the number of items, exhibiting an average relative increase of 1.43% for 3 items and 3.39% for 5 items. The overall 
running time of the NVNS is on average 3 times slower indicating that the implementation still requires further 
improvement. 
 
7. Conclusion 
This study proposes a mat-heuristics approach to solve the fulfillment and consolidation problem of a retailer with an 
online platform and a network of physical stores. The retailer needs to decide for a given set of orders the consolidation 
points and the stores serve the orders. We formulated the problem as a capacitated multi-order mixed-integer linear 
programming (MILP) with piecewise linear costs. We propose a nested variable neighborhood search approach to 
solve the problem and compare the result with the solution of a MILP solver. The performance of the NVNS was 
examined for different values of the parameter that controls the inventory-to-demand ratio. Compared to the MILP 
solver, the NVNS gave a relative percentage increase in cost as 1.56% and 2.98% for the inventory to demand ratio k 
= 1 and 1.5, respectively. Overall, the NVNS shows an average increase of 2.28% in cost compared to the IP. While 
The performance of the NVNS is within acceptable limit in terms of it relative percentage increase in cost to the 
optimal cost of the IP, its computational time is still a bit higher than the IP. Since this study is a work in progress, we 
hope to refine the implementation and make the algorithm robust for large scale implementation. In this study, we 
have considered the case of more items that overlap between stores in the network. We hope to consider scenarios 
where there is limited overlap among stores.

Abstract 
In this work, a population of fractured joint bolts have been collected from automotive and tire plants, and an analysis 
of each bolt is performed to determine the cause of failure, and crack initiation site location on the bolt.  The bolts are 
then grouped by failure cause and location to investigate the probability of failures and probability of failure location.  
The results show that low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue account for 70% of bolt failures, and that 80% of bolt failures 
occur deep in the threaded region in the bolt.  Failure locations that were closer to the intersection of the head and the 
shank were only found in samples that were determined to have failed due to low-cycle fatigue. Still then, only 40% 
of bolt failures that result from low cycle fatigue take place closer to the head, and 60% of the failures occur in the 
threaded region away from the head. The results of this study can help predict the failure location on the bolt, and thus 
help guide preventive maintenance procedures on joint bolts.

1. Introduction
 Bolt failure has been the attributed cause of many accidents and catastrophic failures that were documented in 
literature, such as the break in the water main supply of Boston area in 2010 (Pantić, Ballinger, & Bambei, 2011) 
which resulted in a state of emergency in the State of Massachusetts, the crash of a light sport airplane in Helena, MT 
in 2014 due to bolt overloads (National Transportation Safety Board, 2015), the collapse of the 390-feet wind turbine 
near Vetlanda, Sweden in 2018, after fatigue caused bolt failures in the lower flange joint (Swedish Accident

Collaboration, 2019), machine condition monitoring can predict failures by monitoring the vibrations and assessing 
severity and operating conditions  (Tantawi, Fidan, & Tantawy, 2019) (Dinardo, Fabbiano, & Vacca, 2018), or using 
AI-based vision systems to detect mechanical fasteners and improve energy efficiency (Terry, et al., 2020) 
(Karthikeyan & Subashini, 2021). By knowing the most predictable locations on fasteners, and by assessing the 
changes in vibrations, a smart machine can predict a possible fastener failure before it occurs.  In future work, the 
relationship between flexibility in bolted joints and the statistics of failures will be investigated using simple dynamic 
models (Alazard, Cumer, & Tantawi, 2008) (Tantawi, Alazard, & Cumer, 2008), bolted joints are known to exhibit 
higher flexibility than other types of joints such as welded joints (Cabaleiro, Moutinho, González-Gaya, Caetano, & 
Rosales-Prieto, 2021).  
 
6. Conclusion  
A population of ten fractured bolts were collected from manufacturing industrial settings, and investigated to 
determine the failure cause in each fastener. Low-Cycle and High-cycle fatigue accounted for 70% of the bolt failures. 
The vast majority of all failures (80%) take place at the threaded region away from the head of the bolt. Only failures 
due to low-cycle fatigue were found to occur closer to the head.

Abstract 
This study addresses the critical challenge in blood and blood component management, where uncertainty in demand 
and supply results in a delicate balance between shortages and waste, especially in developing countries. The lack of 
these resources can worsen health conditions and lead to loss of life. The objective is to investigate supply chain 
simulation and optimization methods, focusing on reducing costs and shortages. It is concluded that significant 
advances are concentrated in the management of the stock of blood products, with a notable gap in the planning of 
blood collection in blood centers. There is continued interest in whole blood and platelets, with the application of 
integrated methods and algorithms to improve the management of these resources, particularly in studies of Asian 
origin. The need for comprehensive investigations into the integral management of the supply chain, including 
logistical aspects, is highlighted. Although simulation methods have been identified, research suggests the need for 
detailed studies on the advantages of each method. The study highlights the urgency of exploring and improving 
collection strategies to optimize the supply of blood and blood components. The contribution lies in identifying the 
stages of the supply chain and supporting theories that advocate optimization and simulation to reduce costs, scarcity, 
and waste in this context.

1. Introduction
Advances in health systems have been notable in several aspects related to patient care and the preservation of life. In 
recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the search for comprehensive management, aiming for greater 
efficiency and effectiveness throughout the healthcare process. (Özener et al. 2019). Among the most important 
supplies, especially in highly complex care, blood, and blood components stand out, the availability of which crucially 
depends on voluntary donations.  
Management of the blood and blood components supply chain is considered one of the most complex issues in health 
systems, as it considers uncertainty in the donation process, the perishability of blood and its components, 
preservation, and distribution conditions (Dehaghani et al. 2021). Despite technological advances and scientific 
research aimed at finding a chemical product or process that replaces blood and its components, there is still no one 
effective. (Twumasi and Twumasi 2022). 
The blood supply chain encompasses responsibility for all processes of collection, testing, processing, storage, and 
distribution of blood and its components (red blood cells, leukocytes, platelets, whole blood, frozen blood, and plasma)

Abstract 
Designing a food-energy-water (FEW) nexus framework is critical for the development of future sustainable cities, as 
well as addressing global concerns of increased demand for natural resources (food, energy and, water). A case study 
consisting of seven Urban Farms in South Florida is established, with the main objective of providing fresh produce 
to the local community. Each Urban Farm belongs to a community-scale microgrid system that generates electricity 
from renewable sources (solar, wind, biomass), and provides electricity to the urban farm and surrounding community 
buildings. Additionally, a micro-supply chain is established among the seven farms to increase food availability for 
the local community, combating food deserts and reducing food waste. Following the establishment of a FEW nexus 
framework, a mathematical programming model is introduced to design and optimize the parameters within the 
framework. Data inputs used for the model are obtained from the results of a previously developed agent-based model 
(ABM). The objective of the mathematical programming model is to address the supply and demand balance within 
the FEW network, and depending on the supply-demand trend, will optimally match supply and demand over time, 
using indicators such as cost and carbon footprints. In addition, solving the model identifies optimal capacities for 
renewable energy sources (solar, wind, biomass), as well as the scheduling of the unit commitment and micro supply 
chain. The results will provide valuable insight into the design of a FEW nexus framework, as well as the interactions 
that occur between food, energy, and water systems, and allows for the analysis of different policy scenarios and their 
implications. Once solved, the model provided results for a period of 264 hours, determining optimal operational 
decisions for power production, electricity for irrigation, and consumption of water that is needed for a combined heat 
and power (CHP) unit, and for irrigation of crops. The results of the micro supply chain led to the transport of 78,657kg 
between four farms, and the remaining food waste was converted into biomass energy. The optimal capacities of 
renewable energy technologies were found, solar with a total capacity of 4,400 kW, and wind with a total capacity of 
7,000 kW. The optimal capacity of battery storage systems at each microgrid belonging to each urban farm was found, 
and this was based on electricity demands, as well as electricity generation capacities. The results of the mathematical 
programming model led to the optimal design of an urban FEW framework, determining the optimal capacities of 
renewable energy technologies, battery storage systems, and optimal operation conditions of the FEW nexus.

Abstract 
In the ever-evolving landscape of sustainable business practices, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged 
as an essential component within the energy sector, permeating every facet of its operations. Despite extensive studies 
on CSR-related strategies, there exists a notable gap in understanding the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) at a regional 
level. Consequently, this research focuses on Saudi Arabia, the world's largest energy consumer, as a pivotal hub for 
analyzing the specific CSFs of corporate social responsibility within the energy sector. This study conducts a 
comprehensive literature review to gather CSFs, subsequently validated and assessed by experts and industrial 
managers based in Saudi Arabia. Employing the 'Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory' (DEMATEL) 
method, the research analyzes and visually represents the most influential CSFs for promoting CSR. The findings 
underscore the significance of Saudi energy companies prioritizing key success factors, categorizing them into cause-
and-effect groups. Notably, this research marks the pioneering effort to scrutinize CSFs relevant to the energy sector 
on a regional scale. It provides initial insights into the strategic process of CSR implementation, presenting a decision 
framework aimed at aiding managers in the Saudi energy sector to establish a robust foothold in CSR implementation. 
The findings of this study contribute unique perspectives to energy consumption, offering actionable strategies for 
industry leaders navigating the dynamic landscape of sustainable energy practices.

1. Introduction
The global shift towards sustainability in corporate activities, driven by the United Nations' sustainable development 
goals, is evident in the Saudi Arabian energy sector. Stakeholders are pressuring companies to adopt eco-friendly 
practices, particularly as the sector faces challenges related to oil dependency, resource depletion, and environmental 
concerns. This study focuses on Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
implementation within the Saudi Arabian energy sector. It introduces the innovative DEMATEL method to identify 
and analyse the causal relationships among CSFs. The methodology involves a four-step process: identifying CSFs 
through literature and expert validation, developing a research model, and applying the DEMATEL method for 
analysis. The study's contributions are threefold: firstly, it fills a gap in existing literature by exploring the causal links 
between CSFs and CSR implementation in the Saudi Arabian energy sector. Secondly, the research introduces the 
DEMATEL method as a novel approach, providing visual insights into interrelationships and aiding industrial 
managers in prioritizing key success factors. Lastly, the study holds contextual and industrial significance by offering 
a comprehensive evaluation of CSFs in the energy sector, providing valuable insights for shaping CSR strategies and 
informing policy decisions towards sustainable development.

Which indicates that it has the highest influence on the entire system, societal support can significantly impact the 
CSFs in the Saudi energy sector. A strong focus on building and maintaining positive relationships with local 
communities, addressing environmental concerns, and aligning with societal values and expectations is crucial for the 
sector's success and long-term sustainability. 
 
Establishing the Causal Influence Diagram: The final phase involves creating a causal influence diagram, which serves 
as the concluding step in the DEMATEL model's application. This diagram aids decision-makers in identifying the 
most influential factor among the selected CSFs. In Figure 4, the X-axis depicts the values of D + R, while the Y-axis 
represents the values of D - R, as illustrated in Figure 4.

This study has significant promise for enhancing sustainability and CSR plans in the Saudi Arabian energy sector and 
serves as a model for research in other locations and industries. Engagement with stakeholders: Reinforce 
collaboration with governmental entities, society, and customers to enhance support for CSR initiatives. Leveraging 
technology: Continue to make use of information and communication technology to enhance data analysis, reporting, 
and the communication of sustainability efforts. Dynamic analysis: Investigate the evolving relationships between the 
identified factors, employing methodologies beyond DEMATEL to comprehend how these relationships change over 
time and impact CSR implementation. Comprehensive training program: Develop and implement thorough training 
and development initiatives for the workforce, focusing on ethical standards, safety, and wellness. Resource allocation: 
Ensure that organizational capabilities and resources are dedicated to CSR initiatives, enabling the sustainable 
implementation of green procurement practices and corporate responsibility. Top management commitment: Develop 
unwavering commitment from top management, nurturing a corporate culture that backs CSR and sustainability. 
Strong leadership at the highest levels is crucial in steering CSR initiatives throughout the organization. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The implementation of CSR in the energy sector in Saudi Arabia is a crucial step towards aligning the industry with 
global sustainability standards and contributing to the nation's development. It is evident that CSR initiatives are 
gaining momentum in the sector, with several companies embracing responsible business practices. These efforts have 
the potential to benefit both the industry and the broader Saudi Arabian society by addressing environmental concerns, 
enhancing stakeholder relations, and fostering long-term sustainability. The study's unique contribution is its emphasis 
on identifying and prioritizing CSFs for effective CSR implementation using the DEMATEL method. By doing so, it 
not only fills a significant research gap but also provides practical insights for energy managers and policymakers. 
Furthermore, the DEMATEL approach's methodological contribution simplifies complex interrelationships and 
provides a visual understanding on the causal and consequential influences of CSFs. This tool enables energy sector 
industrial managers to make informed decisions by identifying and prioritizing the most important success factors, 
allowing them to focus on what truly matters for CSR implementation. The most influential factors are found to be

societal support, government backing, and green procurement practices. Societal support emphasizes the importance 
of developing positive relationships with local communities and addressing environmental issues. Government 
assistance emphasizes the importance of collaboration between the government and industry. Green procurement 
practices promote environmental responsibility and sustainability. Each of these factors plays a unique role in driving 
change over time and influencing critical success factors. Societal support creates awareness and demand for 
sustainable energy solutions. The public's understanding of the environmental and economic benefits of clean energy 
encourages individuals to support and engage in sustainable practices. Government backing is essential for 
establishing a conducive policy framework. Green procurement practices create a significant market demand for 
sustainable products and services. This demand, in turn, encourages businesses to adopt sustainable practices to remain 
competitive in procurement processes. It can also influence the entire supply chain, companies that want to secure 
government contracts or meet the demands of environmentally conscious consumers are more likely to adopt 
sustainable energy practices in their operations. This includes setting renewable energy targets, providing incentives, 
and creating regulations that favor sustainable energy development. Collaboration and innovation are critical for 
successful CSR implementation in the energy sector. These findings highlight the importance of societal, 
governmental, and environmental factors in developing CSR strategies for long-term industry success. This study not 
only improves the understanding of the critical role of CSR in the Saudi energy sector, but it also provides industry 
leaders with useful tools for driving meaningful change. It is an important step toward a more sustainable and 
responsible future in a vital and dynamic industry. However, challenges persist, such as the need for more 
comprehensive regulatory frameworks, improved transparency, and a stronger culture of sustainability within the 
sector. While significant progress has been made, continuous commitment and innovation are essential for sustained 
CSR success.

Abstract 
Lean Warehousing is a principle that aims at improving the efficiency of the warehousing system by eliminating 
wasteful activities within it. The principle of Lean Warehousing can be combined with the Value Stream Mapping 
(VSM) method to enhance efficiency in warehousing processes, including those in third-party logistics companies. 
The high demand for third-party logistics services and the intense competition among logistics service providers 
require companies to optimize their systems to remain competitive. The issue of wasteful activities in warehousing 
poses a significant challenge for third-party logistics providers, particularly in the categories of waiting, over-
processing, and transport waste. Therefore, the Value Stream Mapping Method is used in the initial stage of the 
research to map the current warehousing processes comprehensively, followed by an analysis of the root causes using 
a Fishbone Diagram. Finally, the concept of Lean Warehousing is implemented to eliminate the existing waste in the 
processes. The objective of this research is to identify and eliminate waste, as well as reduce response time in the 
inbound and outbound processes of the third-party logistics company's warehousing system. The improvement design 
obtained through the analysis using Lean Warehousing and Value Stream Mapping, includes the creation of scheduling 
Standard Operating Procedures, the implementation of Lean 5S principles, and the use of barcodes for data input in 
the inbound and outbound processes. The research results indicate a reduction in process time by 25.5%, a decrease 
in response time by 29.4%, and a 39% improvement in the efficiency (value-added ratio) of the warehousing system.

1. Introduction
Digital trading activities, commonly known as e-commerce, are a trend that is increasing in Indonesia. This trend 
began to develop significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in 2020 and will continue to grow until 2022. 
Indonesia occupies the first position in the percentage of e-commerce usage in the world compared to other countries, 
such as the UK, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and several other countries (We are Social, 2021). Data shows 
that Indonesian people have the highest percentage level of e-commerce use in the world with a percentage of 88.1%. 
This percentage beats other countries in the world such as the UK which has a percentage of 86.9%, the Philippines 
with 86.2%, and several other countries (CNN Indonesia, 2021). In addition, an increase also occurred in Indonesia's 
export activities. During 2022, Indonesia recorded an increase in export value of 26.07% compared to 2021 (BPS, 
2022). This is a new achievement for Indonesia due to a significant increase compared to previous years.

6. Conclusion 
This study succeeded in identifying and eliminating several activities classified as non-value added with three main 
types of waste, namely waiting at 18.02% with a duration of 24.12 minutes, overprocessing at 16.22% with a duration 
of 53.01 minutes, and transportation at 15 .32% with a duration of 15.83 minutes. In addition, there was also an 
increase in process efficiency (value added ratio) of 39%, from previously 39% to 78%, a decrease in response time 
of 3,371.3 seconds (56.19 minutes) or 29.4%, and a decrease in process time of 2,471.28 (41.19 minutes) or 25.52%. 
There are 3 types of improvement plans that need to be implemented, namely making SOPs for scheduling goods 
handling, applying the Lean 5S principles in the warehousing system, and using barcodes in the process of inputting 
goods data in inbound and outbound processes.

Abstract 
This research paper introduces an innovative concurrent reliability computation model through experimentation, 
utilizing system vibration signals to address and minimize the adverse effects of misalignment on rotor system 
components. To assess reliability and understand the complex interplay, we present adapted design equations and 
employ a simulation-driven approach within the stress-strength interference paradigm. Furthermore, we suggest a 
framework to define secure and crucial thresholds for parallel misalignment and rotational speed, with the goal of 
achieving predetermined reliability objectives for flexible coupling pins. This model demonstrates efficacy in 
industrial rotor systems for regulating misalignment levels among components tailored to specific rotational speeds.

1. Introduction
Misalignment, the second most significant fault in rotating systems after mass imbalance, poses a considerable threat 
by generating vibrations that can result in system failure or catastrophic incidents (Desouki et al. 2020). This prevalent 
issue arises from various factors, including production defects, assembly tolerance variations, thermal distortions, 
dynamic piping forces, and foundation instability, leading to misalignments in forms such as parallel and angular 
misalignments, either individually or in combination. 
To combat the challenges posed by rotor misalignment in rotating machinery, couplings play a crucial role as essential 
components, facilitating power transmission between drive and driven shafts without torsional slip (Haifei and Gong, 
2019). Excessive misalignment in the coupling induces dynamic forces and moments, causing vibrations and

Abstract 
The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare supply chain in Saudi Arabia, offering a 
wide range of benefits, including improved patient care, reduced costs, and more efficient operations. However, the 
adoption of IoT in the Saudi Arabian healthcare supply chain is still in its early stages, and there are a number of 
barriers that need to be addressed. This paper identifies and analyzes 14 potential barriers to IoT adoption in the Saudi 
Arabian healthcare supply chain, based on a review of the literature and brainstorming with experts from industry and 
academia. The contextual relationship between the identified barriers was developed using interpretive structural 
modeling (ISM), and the results were used to determine the driving and dependence power of the barriers using 
MICMAC analysis. The findings of the study suggest that the legal and regulatory environment and the lack of IT 
infrastructure are the two most important barriers to IoT adoption in the Saudi Arabian healthcare supply chain. Other 
important barriers include the lack of awareness and expertise among healthcare professionals, the lack of resources, 
and resistance to change. The findings of this study will be useful for decision-makers in the Saudi Arabian healthcare 
sector to understand the barriers to IoT adoption and to develop strategies to overcome these barriers.

1. Introduction
As the global healthcare industry evolves, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative force, 
promising to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve patient care. In Saudi Arabia, the healthcare supply chain 
is exploring IoT adoption to leverage these benefits and address challenges such as an aging population and service 
delivery inadequacies. The motivation of this paper, in alignment with Saudi Vision 2030, our vision for the integration 
of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare supply chain is to achieve a pioneering and transformative healthcare 
system. This system is envisioned to be highly efficient, technologically advanced, and patient-centric, effectively 
contributing to the Kingdom's aspirations for innovation and excellence in healthcare. We envisage a future where the 
healthcare supply chain in Saudi Arabia is characterized by its agility, responsiveness, and integration of cutting-edge 
IoT technology. The envisioned state is one where real-time data analytics from IoT devices drive decision-making 
processes, optimize resource allocation, and ensure that the highest quality of care is delivered across all healthcare 
facilities. Our vision extends to the establishment of a comprehensive network of connected devices and systems, 
enabling seamless operations from pharmaceutical manufacturing to patient bedside care. We aim to foster an 
environment where continuous learning and adaptation are the norms, with IoT at the core of a resilient healthcare 
infrastructure capable of withstanding future challenges. By realizing this vision, we anticipate that Saudi Arabia will

decisions. Any modifications to this barrier will affect all other barriers across all levels of the hierarchy. In this case, 
barriers 4, 6, 10, and 14 must be considered in the top of the priority hierarchy. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Suggestions for removing barriers to Internet of Things (IoT) adoption in Saudi Arabia's healthcare supply chain 
become vital requirements for the Kingdom's healthcare ecosystem. As a result of this research's thorough 
understanding of the obstacles preventing IoT technologies from being successfully integrated into the healthcare 
supply chain, it have put forth a number of important recommendations to help stakeholders, legislators, and decision-
makers navigate this revolutionary journey: 
1. Invest in Education and Awareness: It is critical to address Barrier 6 (the lack of knowledge about the 
advantages of IoT in the healthcare sector). Prioritizing efforts should be made to inform the public, 
administrators, and healthcare professionals about the potential benefits of IoT in enhancing patient care and 
supply chain effectiveness. 
2. Energy Management: Barrier 10 emphasizes how crucial it is to maximize energy usage in Internet of Things 
systems. To lessen operating expenses and their negative effects on the environment, initiatives to encourage 
energy-efficient IoT devices and practices should be investigated. 
3. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Barrier 14 highlights how crucial it is to follow all applicable laws and 
regulations. To guarantee compliance with changing legislation pertaining to the Internet of Things, 
healthcare institutions should set up strict compliance systems and work with regulatory bodies. 
4. Address Cost Concerns: One major obstacle is Barrier 3, which is the high implementation and operation 
costs. In order to get over this, stakeholders should look at IoT solutions that are affordable and think about 
providing grants or subsidies to encourage investments, especially from smaller healthcare institutions. 
5. Strengthen Data Management: Robust data management techniques are required, given the importance of 
data processing and storage (Barrier 5) and data confidentiality (Barrier 2). Creating scalable, compliant, and 
secure data processing and storage solutions ought to be at the forefront of IoT adoption initiatives. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This project explored the challenges of implementing the Internet of Things (IoT) in Saudi Arabia's healthcare supply 
chain, identifying 14 key obstacles such as data security and lack of skilled workforce. These challenges were grouped 
into four clusters, highlighting different aspects of IoT adoption. The study provides a roadmap for overcoming these 
barriers to leverage IoT benefits like enhanced healthcare access and cost reduction. It emphasizes the need for a 
strategic approach to make Saudi Arabia a leader in using IoT for healthcare improvement, offering insights for IoT 
adoption in developing countries.

Unlike previous research on some discrete or continuous distribution, here there is no specific distribution of the 
sufficiently statistics in finding the rejection area. We therefore derive the formula of the power using the Basic 
concept of the  definition of the power, that is, the probability to reject Ho  under  H1 . 
 
4. Conclusion  
The research studied the power and size of the hypothesis testing of the parameter shape on the Lognormal and 
Logistics distribution.  We here then determined and graphically analysed the power and size on these distributions. 
There are four steps to derive the power and size functions as follow: (1) determine the sufficiently statistics, (2) 
compute the rejection region, (3) derive the formula of the power, and (4) create the graphs using generate data. The 
curve of the power is sigmoid and the curve increase faster (to be one) for small parameter shape (σ ) and large n.   
In this research, the formula of the power is derived using at least the basic concept of the definition of the power. In 
this research, we  used definition of the power on testing  hypothesis of the parameter shape in term of one-side 
hypothesis. A simulation is then given to figure the power’s and size’s curve using R code. The result showed that 
Lognormal distribution depended on the degree of freedom n, bound of the rejection area, and parameter shape (σ ). 
Moreover, the size is always constant and remain unchanged, and here the eligible size is 0.049 close to level of 
significance 0.05. So, we accepted this size as the minimum size ( < 0.05). In the context of the Logistics 
distribution, the result showed that the power of the Logistics distribution increase as the k increases, and the 
highestt curve occurs on large k (k=10), but not for  the σ . Generally, the size is constant and it does not 
significantly change the curve on several k.  Moreover, the size increase as the k increases. We noted here that the 
highest size occurs on k=10, and its value is around 1.0. This size is an impossible thing (not reasonable) to be used 
(far way from 0.05). However, we must choose the small size (less than 0.05), so we did not recommend this size.

Abstract 
Many initiatives to control climate change and mitigate its effects have been developed recently. The implementation 
of the new green logistics strategy and its effects on the commercial sectors in Oman are the subject of several 
initiatives and studies that are required. The fact that COVID-19 accelerates supply chain management and its 
operations in Oman to begin using green solutions and a sustainable business strategy to achieve sustainable 
development, it is critical to understand which aspects deserve specific consideration. Sustainable solutions in the field 
of logistics management as well as maintaining net zero emissions in the Sultanate of Oman by implementing such a 
strategy. Maintaining a sustainable business model and sustainable supply chain management will assist any logistics 
organization in Oman in reducing emissions and achieving long-term success, which directly impacts green logistics. 
This paper's main objectives are to examine and identify strategies for implementing the influence of green logistics 
on transportation and how to keep green logistics aligned with a sustainable transportation system. This research also 
focuses on sustainable business models that will enhance logistics in support of zero net emissions as well as 
sustainable solutions that will facilitate the implementation of green logistics. The goal will be possible to achieve by 
combining sustainable SCM with green logistics, just as the associated SCM is necessary and aligns with logistics.

participant well-being. Incorporating diverse assessment tools could reveal additional benefits of the intervention, 
potentially reflected in improved scores across a range of functional activities. 
 
By implementing these proposed improvements, the effectiveness of the robotic assistance system for CP individuals 
can be further enhanced. These improvements, coupled with ongoing research and development, have the potential to 
significantly advance the field of assistive technology for cerebral palsy. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The validation of our study's results demonstrates the advanced stage of our personalized robotic assistance system 
for cerebral palsy (CP) rehabilitation. We have employed a rigorous validation process, ensuring our system not only 
meets but also exceeds current standards in CP rehabilitation. Our primary validation method involved statistical 
hypothesis testing, particularly paired t-tests, to ascertain the significant improvements achieved in key metrics like 
range of motion, grip strength, and 10-Meter Walk Test times. The results, showing statistical significance with p-
values less than 0.05, underscore the effectiveness of our system compared to traditional interventions. To further 
validate our findings, we compared our results with seminal studies in CP rehabilitation, such as the systematic review 
by Novak et al. (2020). This comparison demonstrated that our system aligns with and enhances the established 
efficacy of various interventions, especially in improving motor skills and functional abilities. Our approach surpasses 
traditional methods, offering a more dynamic and personalized rehabilitation experience. Moreover, our longitudinal 
analysis, drawing inspiration from Sharan (2005), provided insights into the long-term impacts of our intervention. 
This analysis was crucial in demonstrating the sustained efficacy of our robotic assistance system over time, indicating 
its potential for long-term rehabilitation success. We also incorporated qualitative feedback, in line with participant-
centred methodologies discussed in Hindawi (2022). This feedback, gathered from participants and caregivers, was 
analysed alongside our quantitative data, highlighting the comprehensive benefits of our intervention in real-world 
settings. This holistic approach to validation, combining quantitative and qualitative data, illustrates the multifaceted 
improvements our system offers to individuals with CP.  
 
Our study, therefore, not only reaffirms the utility of our robotic assistance system in enhancing the quality of life for 
individuals with CP but also marks a significant advancement in the field of CP rehabilitation. Through our integration 
of rigorous statistical analysis, comparative research review, longitudinal assessment, and qualitative feedback, our 
methods present a robust and comprehensive validation of our system. This approach places our work in line with and 
contributes to the broader advancements in CP research, as supported by the works of Novak et al. (2020), Sharan 
(2005), and the studies presented by Teachers College - Columbia University (2021).

Abstract 
Over the past few decades, Internet sites have become integral components of business operations across all industries. 
This increased prominence, however, has also led to the emergence of various attack vectors damaging the web sites 
with service outages, poor user experiences, financial losses, and damaged reputations to the business. No web or 
mobile application on the Internet is immune to these attacks, underscoring the critical need for robust security 
solutions to safeguard websites against malicious attacks. At the heart of the security solutions lies the capability to 
accurately tell apart malicious actors from legitimate users with minimal false positives and false negatives, while the 
solutions should operate efficiently, exhibiting high performance, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. Robustness of 
the solution is also crucial to ensure that attackers cannot decipher the inner workings of the security systems, 
preventing them from adapting and circumventing security defenses over time. With the advent of machine learning 
and big data systems, security solutions have evolved to effectively detect and mitigate various threat vectors. The 
paper delves into an examination of various attack vectors, industry security solutions driven by big data and machine 
learning and outlines key design considerations necessary for creating effective and resilient security solutions. The 
paper concludes by offering a brief perspective on anticipated future developments to secure the Internet.

Abstract 
The container terminal industry faces the challenge of efficiently allocating berths for incoming vessels to maximize 
operational efficiency. The Berth Allocation Problem (BAP) is a fundamental issue that must be addressed, especially 
in busy ports such as TangerMed in Morocco. To tackle this problem, a real case study was conducted, focusing on 
optimizing the BAP at TangerMed. The study proposes a simplified linear integer programming model that considers 
the mooring time and initial berthing location on a single continuous quay at X-Port. This model was implemented 
using the PuLP Package in Python, and the results were displayed on a time-space diagram. The proposed approach 
is expected to improve seaport management and enhance the quality of operational services, ultimately leading to 
increased efficiency and profitability for the terminal.

Berth Allocation, Optimization 
1. Introduction
The issue of berth allocation involves determining the berthing schedule and location for incoming vessels. The goal 
of this problem is to optimize the use of limited resources, including berths and equipment, while minimizing the 
waiting time of vessels and the cost of resource usage. Over the years, the berth allocation problem has become 
increasingly important in enhancing seaport operations and has thus received significant attention from academia and 
industry. Several models exist for addressing spatial and temporal variables in port locations, including the berth 
allocation problem (BAP), the dynamic and discrete berth allocation problem (DDBAP), the quay crane allocation 
problem (QCAP), and the quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP). These models differ in their constraints regarding 
time and space. Generally, these constraints limit each vessel's berthing duration and position, while the available 
space is an internal parameter of the maritime terminal, and the berthing time and space required are specific to the 
vessel. The BAP aims to schedule vessels at berths by assigning the appropriate berth, vessel size, and time at the 
maritime terminal. Various researchers have attempted to address the problem from different perspectives, including 
deterministic and non-deterministic approaches, with exact solution methods and heuristics. However, most models 
have been developed based on deterministic assumptions, with only a few accounting for variability and uncertainty. 
Various approaches have been proposed to tackle the BAP, including mathematical programming, heuristic 
algorithms, and metaheuristics. Mathematical programming models such as integer linear programming (ILP) have 
been widely used to solve the BAP. For instance, Chen and Chen (2014) proposed an ILP model for the BAP that 
considers the availability of berths and handling equipment, vessel size and priority, and the order of arrival. The 
proposed model was tested on a real-world dataset and showed promising results. 
Heuristic algorithms are another class of methods commonly used for the BAP. These algorithms aim to quickly 
generate a feasible solution that may not be optimal but satisfies the constraints of the problem. Zhang et al. (2017)

5. Results and Discussion 
From the results we got in Day 1, we can clearly see that for vessel 2, vessel 3, and vessel 4 the mooring time is exactly 
the same as the expected arrival time already given to the terminal operator because the berthing positions were already 
free at the time of arriving. In this case, a reservation for these clients will be made by respecting the exact mooring 
time and berthing position given. However, the mooring time of vessel 1 is 15 while the arrival given time is 12; Also, 
the mooring time of vessel 5 is 18 while the expected time of arriving is 17 which means the mooring time of the two 
vessels are after the expected arrival time. This can be explained by the non-availability of the adequate berthing 
positions in the time horizon given by the clients of the two vessels. In this case, those clients will be informed 
beforehand about their mooring time and exact berthing positions; therefore, they will not have to speed up and 
consume more fuel in order to get to the port terminal before other vessels. Also, they will not get to the port while 
other vessels are served and be obliged to wait for berths to get free, the thing that will exempt them from paying the 
taxes and penalty cost for a delayed berthing/ departure. Similarly, we can see from the results of Day 2 that vessel 1, 
vessel 3, and vessel 4 are having the mooring time equals to their expected arrival time. Yet, the mooring time of 
vessel 2 exceeds the time of arrival where it is expected to be at the port container terminal at 10; however, the given 
mooring time is at 14. As already discussed, the clients will receive a reservation at the adequate berthing with the 
right mooring time. The thing that will ensure them having their spot waiting for them upon their arrival without any 
delay. From the interpretation results and more specifically the time-space diagrams, there is no overlapping in terms 
of the processing time or the berthing positions. Also, as already mentioned, the company 40 has three quay cranes, 
and the policy of X-Port emphasizes that each incoming vessel should be served by only one crane that has the ability 
to make 20 moves per hour. Since the length of the quay is 500m, the maximum number of vessels that can be along 
the quay at the same service time is 3 which means that the quay cranes available are sufficient. See Figure 2 for Time-
space Diagram in Day 1.

6. Conclusion 
Berth allocation problem (BAP) is a fundamental optimization problem in the field of maritime logistics, which aims 
to allocate berths to incoming vessels arriving at a seaport. Berthing operations are considered one of the most crucial 
seaport operations. They have a great impact both on vessels’ service time and service quality. The various layouts of 
seaport terminals lead to a wide range of methods for solving logistics problems. This research has addressed a 
simplified optimization method for the fundamental berth allocation problem (BAP) at TangerMed container terminal 
in Morocco. To address this challenge, this study proposed a simplified integer linear programming model, solved in 
Python using the PuLP Package, to calculate the mooring time and initial berthing location on a single continuous

quay at X-Port container terminal. The time-space diagram presents the output of the Python program. Implementing 
this method can aid in improving the management of the seaport and enhancing the operational quality of service at 
the port. It enables better decision-making in the allocation of resources within the cargo terminal, ultimately leading 
to more efficient and effective operations.

Abstract 
This study gives an in-depth look into the well-known ball and plate system, which uses sensors, actuators, and 
controllers to keep a rolling ball balanced on a flat platform. The theoretical investigations and analyses underlying 
the ball and plate system are clarified, including the system's mathematical and physical modeling, as well as a full 
explanation of the components involved. The goal of our project is to design a closed-loop PID controller to achieve 
ball balancing on the platform. A resistive touch screen is used in the project as a sensor to detect the ball's current 
horizontal and vertical coordinates. The PID controller then compares these coordinates to the intended position and 
controls two DC servo motors acting as actuators, tilting the platform to achieve and maintain the desired ball position. 
The system's goal is to keep the ball at a specified fixed location in the face of any disruptions (disturbance rejection). 
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to tweak the PID controller settings, which optimizes an objective function 
that minimizes the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) in both the x and y coordinates of the ball's position on the plate. 
This project is an implementation of the PID controller, which is used in a variety of real-world applications such as 
balancing robots, drones, and temperature control systems. The fundamental goal of developing such a system is to 
get a full educational knowledge of balancing systems and their operating principles, which are important in many 
sectors of life and can be improved further for future usage. Furthermore, the introduction of an optimization approach 
to improve the system's reaction to disturbances is regarded as a significant addition to the area.

3.3 Proposed Improvements  
In our project, we have identified several recommendations to enhance the performance and capabilities of the ball 
and plate system: 
 Transitioning from a two-degree-of-freedom (2𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷) system to a six-degree-of-freedom (6𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷) system is 
advisable. By incorporating six degrees of freedom, we can achieve a faster response while maintaining the 
same level of quality. However, it is essential to note that this transition may introduce increased complexity 
in the system's design. Nevertheless, the benefits of improved speed and responsiveness make it a worthwhile 
consideration. 
 We propose utilizing six servo motors instead of the current configuration to enhance stability and response 
time further. The system can achieve excellent stability and a faster response to disturbances by incorporating 
six servo motors. This increased actuation capability allows for finer control and adjustment of the platform, 
resulting in improved overall performance. 
 Consider implementing more advanced control techniques such as fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic control systems 
offer the ability to handle complex and uncertain environments, making them well-suited for applications 
like the ball and plate system. By employing fuzzy logic control; we can leverage its adaptive and robust 
nature to enhance the system's performance, particularly in scenarios involving varying operating conditions 
or external disturbances. 
 
4. Conclusion  
To sum up, we used the PSO algorithm into the simulations to improve the performance of our system. We intended 
to improve the system's stability and precision by setting the goal function as reducing the Integral Absolute Error 
(IAE) of the ball's position on the plate. The comparison of simulation results with and without PSO optimization 
offered useful insights into the optimization technique's efficacy and impact on the system's responsiveness. 
 
In the conclusion, the primary objective of our ball and plate system is to precisely control the position of the ball on 
the touch screen, whether maintaining it in a static position or guiding it along predetermined paths, while promptly 
rectifying any disturbances that occur. The reference point can be set as the center of the plate or adjusted to a user-
defined location. Regardless of the magnitude of the disturbance, the system swiftly restores the ball's position, 
ensuring minimal steady-state error, negligible overshoot, and rapid response time. Through the completion of this 
project, we have acquired substantial knowledge across various domains, underscoring its educational value, 
particularly in university laboratory settings. By incorporating this system, we can provide students with a deeper 
comprehension of control systems and their practical applications. The insights gained from this project have furthered 
our understanding and enabled us to contribute to the continuous advancement of control systems technology.

Abstract 
Budget-conscious tourists are travellers electing to plan their vacations by taking advantage of pricing variability to 
minimize the total cost of their desired multi-city vacation. This paper presents the formulation and analysis of a time-
discretized linear integer programming (LIP) model to optimize total travel costs for travellers vacationing between 
major European cities by considering dynamic flight costs and accommodation expenses. The proposed time-
discretized network flow model presented is an extension of classical Shortest-Route-Problems (SRP) and is solved 
using Excel’s SIMPLEX LP algorithm. Flight data collected from the online travel agency Kiwi.com between May 
1st, 2022, and May 30th was found to show significant daily price fluctuation, whereas accommodation prices collected 
from Airbnb.com between May 1st, 2023, and May 13th, 2023, remained stable. This paper includes the model 
formulation, assumptions, and cost analysis of varying travel instances by rotating the origin city and altering the stay 
duration at each destination. Three solutions, the generous, greedy, and cost-minimized solutions, were calculated for 
each travel trip instance. By optimizing the route, the cost can be reduced by upwards of 20.3% and 6.7% relative to 
the generous and greedy solutions. The model evaluated the impact of varying staying durations on the optimal travel 
order and was found to be very robust in terms of stay durations such that the optimized cost remained constant. The 
results of this paper have implications for the global travel industry by lowering the barrier of entry for budget-friendly 
consumers.

1. Introduction
The aviation industry itself is one of the largest global markets accounting for upwards of 2.7 trillion in global GDP 
and 65 million jobs (Asquith 2020). It is a huge global employer and facilitates the ever-growing demand for trans-
national and trans-continental travel. Of the uses for air travel, tourism has been its lifeblood contributing direct and 
indirectly to over 9 trillion of global GDP (Constantin et al. 2020). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline 
industry was particularly affected with grounded fleets and travel restrictions halting consumer spending in the 
industry. Following the reversal of these restrictions where airlines could begin to fly under normal business

From the above plot, the optimized solution shows an improvement between 16%-21% relative to the generous 
solution and 0% - %6.5 relative to the greedy solution. In the instances where Paris and Barcelona are the origin cities, 
the greedy and optimal routes are identical. In the other three instances, there is a clear improvement over 5%.  
 
5.6 Variable Stay Duration on Optimal Schedule  
With an origin from Frankfurt, Table 4 shows the impact of changing the stay duration of each intermediary city on 
the total cost of the optimal solution.

It is apparent from Table 4 that varying the staying durations at each location will impact the route of travel but will 
have a limited impact on the total cost. This is one instance of the model's applicability, but further work should be 
done to generalize the relationship between stay duration and total cost as this depends on both the travel and 
accommodation prices. 
 
5.6 Proposed Improvements 
Within the proposed model, there are important assumptions and considerations taken which need to be addressed to 
improve and widen the breadth of the model’s applicability. Firstly, the model takes advantage of the hub-and-spoke 
network design to ensure the daily availability of flights between all destinations and that travel between them is bi-
directional. If the travellers wish to visit a destination with limited availability, the model must be adjusted with 
additional constraints to accommodate more infrequent travel. Additionally, the model does not consider travel time 
which is a parameter of great interest to travellers as they may wish to consider the trade-off between less expensive 
but more time-consuming and indirect travel. Lastly, the model can be expanded to respond dynamically to 
disturbances such as flight cancellations due to weather and maintenance.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this paper introduced a linear integer programming (IP) approach to optimize the travel itineraries of 
European tourists, minimizing total travel expenses encompassing flight and accommodation costs. The proposed 
discretized time network flow model, an extension of traditional Shortest-Route-Problems (SRP), was employed and 
solved using Microsoft Excel's integer optimization capabilities. The research unveiled considerable daily fluctuations 
in flight costs, reaching up to $312 within a brief timeframe, while accommodation expenses from AirBnB.com 
remained more stable. This paper provided the mathematical model formulation, underlying assumptions, and 
explored diverse travel scenarios involving changes in the origin city and stay durations at each destination. Three 
strategies—generous, greedy, and cost-minimized—were examined for each travel route originating from different 
locations. Optimizing the itinerary yielded cost reductions of up to 20.3% and 6.7% when compared to the generous 
and greedy approaches, respectively. The most cost-effective trip itinerary was achieved when the journey started in 
London, totalling $1671, whereas the most expensive route was initiated in Frankfurt, costing $1858. The implications 
of these findings extend to the global tourism industry, where even small enhancements in travel planning can result 
in substantial savings for both businesses and budget-conscious consumers.

Abstract 
The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly changed the field of education and is revolutionizing 
the ways trainees learn. AI has the capability to completely transform the way we teach and learn, improving 
accessibility, individualization, and effectiveness in the classroom. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) development is 
one of the primary areas where AI is having an impact. These systems analyze student data using algorithms and offer 
tailored feedback and direction depending on each student's unique needs and learning preferences. Another 
illustration of how technology is changing education is Chatbots that run on AI. These Chatbots give students 
immediate feedback, assist trainers in tracking students' development, and evaluate and pinpoint areas where students 
might be having challenges. Overall, the application of AI in education is changing how we teach and learn and 
improving access to, personalization of, and effectiveness of education. This research at Elmergib University focuses 
on methodologies to incorporate AI Chatbots in chemical engineering challenging disciplines ensuring that the 
technologies support student learning rather than replacing the role of critical thinking or human interaction.  The 
incorporation of AI technology tools as instructing topics of process optimization, data analysis, safety, and 
communication. There are remarkable possibilities for AI technologies to expand significantly.

institutions can lessen the risks associated with the improper use of Chatbots, promote a safe and comfortable learning 
environment, and ensure that the Chatbot effectively completes its intended educational aim. Open-ended questions 
can be a helpful addition to exams since they push students to think critically, clarify their ideas completely, and give 
innovative responses. It can be challenging for AI systems to accurately replicate this type of assessment. Here are 
some considerations to make when including open-ended questions on exams. When responding to open-ended 
questions, students must engage in higher-order thinking skills like analysis, synthesis, assessment, and creativity. 
These questions force students to exercise critical thinking skills and go beyond rote memorizing of facts or 
information. Regarding complexity and originality, open-ended questions provide students the chance to demonstrate 
their creative problem-solving abilities and present original opinions. Students have the opportunity to, rather than 
being restricted to, predefined responses. 
 
Open-ended questions are more adaptable and flexible since they provide a range of potential solutions. Students are 
allowed to tailor their comments based on their knowledge, experiences, and insights. This adaptability promotes 
personalized learning and acknowledges the possibility of using several legitimate approaches or points of view. 
According to Communication Skills, open-ended questions force students to effectively explain their opinions, present 
convincing arguments, and offer supporting evidence, all of which assist students in improving their communication 
skills. The development of critical thinking and effective communication, which are crucial skills in a range of 
disciplines, can be accomplished through assessing students' ability to explain themselves logically and persuasively. 
Following the requirements, develop exact assessment criteria and rubrics that are designed especially for open-ended 
questions. The key components of a strong response, such as breadth of analysis, ingenuity, supporting details, and 
clarity of communication, should be highlighted by these scoring criteria. It is simpler to consistently and properly 
evaluate student responses when there are clear criteria. Evaluation and feedback from the teacher are frequently 
required for open-ended questions in order to gauge the quality and depth of the student's responses. By evaluating 
their work and offering constructive criticism, teachers play a significant role in assisting students in learning, 
developing their creative potential, and thinking critically. Even though AI technology can assist with some aspects 
of assessment, the evaluation of open-ended questions is best supported by human evaluators who can discern the 
intricacies, inventiveness, and originality of students' responses. By using open-ended questions in exams, educational 
institutions can promote students' critical thinking, creativity, and development of higher-order cognitive skills. This 
approach promotes a well-rounded educational experience and honors the complexity and originality of students' 
thoughts. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The employment of Chatbots as virtual teaching assistants can offer students individualized support by responding to 
their queries, helping with the course materials, and providing advice on a range of subjects. They can assist in making 
instructional content delivery more dynamic and interesting for students, improving their learning experience. In 
academic libraries, AI Chatbots have also been installed to help users find pertinent journal articles, books, or other 
resources. They can offer suggestions based on user preferences, help manage citations, and advise on how to use 
library resources efficiently. This facilitates quicker and more effective information access for scholars and students. 
Additionally, Chatbots can be used in academic institutions for administrative tasks. They can respond to common 
questions concerning enrollment, registration, financial assistance, and campus services, freeing up staff members' 
time to concentrate on more difficult responsibilities. Additionally, Chatbots can help with scheduling and remind 
users of key notifications, deadlines, and academic activities. Additionally, AI Chatbots can aid researchers in their 
work by helping with data analysis, literature reviews, and recommending prospective study topics based on the body 
of knowledge already available. They can facilitate research, assist in locating relevant studies, and give access to 
databases and resources. It is crucial to remember that while AI Chatbots may improve the academic experience, they 
are not intended to completely replace human connection. Instead of serving as a replacement for human direction and 
mentorship, they ought to be viewed as instruments that add to human expertise and support. In general, integrating 
AI systems and Chatbots into academic work has the potential to revolutionize several administrative, educational, 
and research duties while also delivering more individualized and effective services to students, researchers, and 
academic professionals.

Abstract 
3D printing is an advance technology that have changed many industries and the way of producing the products, and 
in the foreseeable future 3D printing will be a major contributor in most of advance industries such as medical and 
aerospace industries. In the future, 3D printing will play a significant role in most industries and will advance many 
fields. However, 3D printing technologies are considered by many designers as good and valid technology in which 
most of geometries can be produced without considering the limitation of the technology which makes it a problem in 
the final stages of the process. FDM is one of the most popular 3D printing technologies, however the designers are 
unaware of the process limitations and design rules the process. This research aims to address the absence of awareness 
in such designs, by developing a set of design rules so the design can be more reliable, predictable and gives the 
required results when making parts.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing wheel was pushed to develop new technologies to satisfy the world's requirements by the industrial 
revolution that occurred over the last century, as well as increased use of natural resources and expanding 
consumption. One of the most critical difficulties in manufacturing is the time it takes to produce a prototype. 
Previously, a prototype would be created using a lathe, injection molding, casting, and other ways. Traditional 
procedures take time to create and have a high cost to manufacture a model, but modern technology like as 3D printing 
can help to reduce manufacturing time and costs. In the 1980s, pioneered 3D printing.  3D printing technologies are 
being used in a variety of industries, including medicine, aerospace, automotive, architecture, industrial equipment, 
education, and consumer goods (Shahrubudin, 2019, Ramya, A). The advancement of 3D printing over the last decade 
has resulted in lower machine costs, improved precision, and the development of a wide range of materials for use. 
One of the most appealing features of 3D printing is its simplicity; only requires a CAD model to produce the product, 
and it can print any complex shape or geometry. 3D printing allows you to create a part from scratch in only a few

Abstract 
This paper focuses on identifying and addressing the challenges hindering renewable energy development in Saudi 
Arabia. A literature review and expert insights pinpointed seven key obstacles: lack of a stable investment climate, 
political instability, technical expertise, limited institutional capacity, varying environmental conditions, dependence 
on fossil fuel, and limited public awareness. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was employed to prioritize these 
challenges, revealing that limited public awareness is the most crucial barrier and varying environmental conditions 
are followed. To counter these challenges, the paper proposes seven strategies: encouraging private sector investment, 
providing financial incentives, strengthening the regulatory framework, developing a skilled workforce, promoting 
public awareness, collaborating with international organizations, and implementing policies. The effectiveness of 
these strategies was assessed using the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method, which highlighted policy 
implementation as the foremost approach. This research aims to guide decision-makers in Saudi Arabia in effectively 
allocating resources and making informed decisions to facilitate the growth of renewable energy.

1. Introduction
The global energy sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the dual goals of reducing carbon 
emissions and meeting the rising energy demand. This transformation is increasingly integrating renewable energy 
sources like solar and wind power, considered critical for achieving a sustainable future. These sources offer an 
alternative to fossil fuels and help mitigate ecological impacts (Smith, J., & Brown, A. 2021). Their implementation 
is not just desirable but necessary for addressing climate change and ensuring global energy security (Lee, Y., & Kim, 
S. 2021). In Saudi Arabia, a pivotal shift towards alternative energy sources is underway. The nation, known for its
significant oil production and consumption, stands at a crucial point in moving towards a sustainable energy path (Al-
Saud, M. 2022). The abundance of solar and wind resources presents a significant opportunity for the country to
diversify its energy portfolio, enhancing long-term economic sustainability (Mitchell, D., & Vega, S. 2019). This
transition is a key aspect of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 strategic plan, which aims to develop renewable energy and
establish a sustainable energy framework (Ratikainen, K. W. 2017). To realize these goals, a deep understanding of
the various factors influencing this transition is essential.

6. Conclusions 
Renewable energy in Saudi Arabia faces many obstacles. This study identified seven challenges and seven solutions 
to overcome them. The obstacle weights were determined using AHP. Meanwhile, CoCoSo was used to rank the 
suggested options by effectiveness. The most significant obstacles were limited public awareness and education about 
the potential benefits of renewable energy and the need to transition to a more sustainable energy mix, followed by 
varying environmental and climatic conditions across the country that require customized renewable energy solutions 
and a lack of technical expertise and skilled labor in the renewable energy sector. Developing and implementing 
policies to improve country stability and security, which could attract investment and financing for renewable energy 
projects, was the most important strategy to overcome the obstacles. This study may help Saudi Arabian decision-
makers make informed choices and efficiently allocate resources to renewable energy. Renewable energy development 
in Saudi Arabia is essential for economic growth, energy security, and environmental sustainability. Saudi Arabia can 
achieve its renewable energy development goals and contribute to global climate change mitigation by acknowledging 
and resolving the stated obstacles. The findings of this research could help other nations facing similar challenges in 
developing sustainable energy sources. Sustainable economic growth, energy security, and environmental 
sustainability depend on renewable energy development in Saudi Arabia. By acknowledging and resolving the stated 
obstacles, Saudi Arabia can achieve its renewable energy development goals and contribute to global climate change 
mitigation. The findings of this research could help other nations facing similar challenges in developing sustainable 
energy sources.

Abstract 
The present study examined the impact of Lean service methodology and work standardization on the customer 
disengagement process in a Peruvian based company in the banking and finance sector. Data was collected before and 
after implementation to identify issues and design solutions based on 5S and work standardization. The results 
highlighted the significant impact of these methodologies on the customer disengagement process. By conducting root 
cause analysis using the problem tree tool, issues such as low standardization in creating letters and information 
request emails, delays in identifying responses to customers and relationship managers, disorganized databases storing 
historical communications, lack of standardization in comments for manager approval, and delays in confirming 
information receptions were identified. Implementing engineering solutions based on the mentioned methodologies, 
such as mass creation and standardization of information requests, setting up an automated flow for request reception, 
organizing and standardizing information databases, and eliminating unnecessary data within these, led to an 80% 
improvement in the disengagement process efficiency. The application of the 5S methodology and work 
standardization proved effective within the company. It allowed for the identification and addressing of root causes, 
resulting in time improvements such as a 94% reduction in registration and query time in the customer response 
reception database, a 66% reduction in time for sending requests to managers, and a 91% reduction in registration and 
query time in the manager's database. These contributed to reducing operational recurrence costs by over 70,000 
Peruvian nuevos soles (PEN) per year. These findings underscore the importance of implementing Lean Service tools 
in the banking and finance sector to achieve greater operational efficiency and service quality for customers and 
stakeholders.

1. Introduction
With the fourth industrial revolution came the era of digitalization, sparking a rapid competition to transform the 
internal processes of multiple companies across various sectors into efficient digital workflows. This competition 
provides these companies with the capacity to reach and serve a vast number of clients. Within this context lies the 
issue addressed in our research work, where the current resources, valueless activities, and outdated, highly 
bureaucratic processes managed by the ethics and compliance division of a financial entity in Peru fall short in

6. Conclusion 
After conducting extensive research and planning for this improvement model, we can conclude that the application 
of work standardization, process automation, and the implementation of 5S in the client disengagement process within 
a banking and finance sector company achieved a significant improvement in productivity and efficiency in said 
process. 
 
Through the use of other diagnostic tools such as the Systematic Interrogation Technique, Pareto diagram, Time study, 
and a series of matrices like the As-Is and To-Be matrix, a better understanding and structuring of the collected data 
and research objectives were achieved. 
 
Regarding the improvement of the established indicators for the disengagement process objectives, the pilot test 
evidenced a significant increase in each of them. The time for sending information requests to clients was reduced by 
92%. The time taken to identify responses to requests decreased by 95%. The time for recording and consulting 
responses to requests from clients decreased by 94%. In the case of the time required for sending requests for approval 
from the sectorist, there was a reduction of 66%. Finally, the time for recording and consulting approval requests by 
sectorists decreased by 91%. Overall, there was an improvement in the overall disengagement effectiveness indicator 
by 64%.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to determine and analyze how employee behavior in the face of organizational change is 
moderated by management support. This research understands how management support factors can moderate the 
relationship between employee change behavior and its impact on the organization. The research design uses a 
quantitative approach through a survey. The unit of analysis in this research is employees and teaching staff at a private 
university, which has a total of 73 respondents. The data analysis technique was carried out with the SEM-PLS 
approach to test the hypothesis. The results of the data analysis show that there is a negative influence between 
employee behavior and organizational change of 0.188, which is statistically significant because the t-count value is 
1.318 (smaller than 1.96). Management support has a positive influence on organizational change. There is a weak 
moderating effect on organizational change with a value of 0.188. The managerial implications of this study can guide 
the management of private universities in improving management support and encouraging management to 
communicate with employees more actively during the organizational change process. It also underlines the 
importance of managerial training in dealing with organizational change and identifying barriers to change that may 
arise. The results of this study can also help the management team develop a more effective change strategy. Private 
universities can increase the level of employee satisfaction and performance and ultimately improve the overall 
efficiency of the organization in the future.

Table 9 shows that two of the three hypotheses are not accepted. This means there is a direct relationship between 
employee behavior and organizational change, and a weak moderating effect which is explained as follows: 
1. There is a negative influence of employee behavior on organizational change of 0.188 and statistically significant 
because the t-test value of 1.318 (less than 1.96) is obtained. This condition shows that if employee behavior is 
negative, then work productivity will increase, where behavior does not cause changes that can hamper work 
flow. 
2. There is a positive influence of management support on organizational changes with a significance level of 0.000, 
as indicated by a statistically significant t-value of 7.953 (greater than 1.96). This condition shows that if employee 
behavior is negative, then work productivity will increase, where behavior does not cause changes that can hamper 
work flow.  
3. There is a weak moderating effect on organizational change with a value of 0.072 which is statistically significant 
because the t-value obtained is 1.806 (smaller than 1.96). This condition shows that the moderating effect is weak 
on the influence of employee behavior on organizational change. This means that management's efforts to support 
and motivate or direct employees towards change do not have the effect of reinforcing the change. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
This study concludes that employee behavior does not significantly impact organizational change. In contrast, 
management support significantly affects organizational change, with management support weakly moderating the 
impact of employee behavior on this change. The managerial implications of this research offer guidance for Private 
Higher Education Institutions' management teams, emphasizing the enhancement of management support and the need 
for managers to communicate more actively with employees during organizational change processes. Furthermore, 
these implications highlight the importance of managerial training in navigating organizational change and identifying 
potential obstacles. Additionally, the study's findings can assist management teams in devising more effective change 
strategies. Implementing these strategies at Bina Darma University could improve employee satisfaction and 
performance, ultimately leading to long-term organizational efficiency. Future research should consider this study as 
a versatile reference, incorporating a range of variables and/or additional indicators.

Abstract 
South African pulp and paper mills have encountered frequent breakdowns of centrifugal pumps, resulting in 
considerable production losses. A case study was conducted to determine the factors contributing to these failures and 
devise ways to enhance pump reliability. Data were collected through questionnaires and operational records. The 
study revealed that inadequate maintenance, misalignment of pump components, lack of lubrication, improper 
baseplate installation, subpar sealing arrangements, inadequate design of the pumping system, and foreign materials 
entering the system were the primary causes of pump failure. To improve reliability, this study suggests employing 
machine learning methods to select the optimal maintenance strategy and provide internal maintenance personnel with 
training in condition monitoring systems. This will enable both pulp and paper mills and pump manufacturers to 
identify blind spots and improve the dependability of centrifugal pumps.

1. Introduction
South Africa is one of the world's largest pulp and paper producers, making the pulp and paper industry a major 
contributor to the South African economy (Chamberlain et al., 2005). A pulp-and-paper company based in South 
Africa has hundreds of centrifugal pumps installed in their production plants. Every papermaking process relies 
heavily on pumping, and pulping, bleaching, refining, and stock preparation involve large pumps and complex 
multiphase flows (Lindsay, 1992). This South African pulp and paper mill has experienced centrifugal pump 
breakdowns. A study (Maverengo, 2017) was conducted to discover ways to reduce energy use in South African pulp 
and paper mills, highlighting that the industry spends a lot of money on pumping systems, one of which is insufficient 
maintenance programs, which also result in significant energy loss. Traditionally, centrifugal pumps have been 
designed to have an average lifespan of approximately 30 years (Al-Obaidi, 2018). However, a   pulp and paper 
company in South Africa has raised concerns that they are experiencing centrifugal pump breakdowns that occur 
unexpectedly before the manufacturers’ recommended useful life. When these pumps fail, the company loses millions 
of rands in revenue owing to production loss, and the pumps’ life cycle costs become massive as well. In South Africa, 
there are few to no studies conducted in this area on the pulp and paper industry; therefore, the causes of centrifugal 
pump breakdowns are unclear or unknown. 
1.1 Objectives 
The primary goal of this study is to 1) determine the underlying reasons for the breakdown of centrifugal pumps in 
South African pulp and paper companies. Furthermore, 2) to give engineering managers the techniques and approaches 
they need to properly oversee the dependability of centrifugal pumps in the pulp and paper sector.

4.5 Validation  
The reliability and validity of the terms were used to assess the research quality. Validity is concerned with a measure's 
precision, whereas reliability is concerned with its consistency (Hasan et al., 2021). This study used triangulation to 
ensure reliability and validity. Triangulation is used to assess and improve the validity of research findings (Ghrayeb 
et al. 2011). It helps improve the credibility and validity of the study, making use of multiple data sources reduce the 
research biases in sampling, procedural bias, and researcher biases, thus increasing validity and credibility (Bans-
Akutey and Tiimub, 2021). Findings from the literature review were used to populate the questionnaire. The results 
from the questionnaire, operational data, and literature review were compared to make sound conclusions and 
recommendations. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study investigated centrifugal pump failures using three sources: literature review, questionnaire, and operational 
data. This study also examined the strategies and methods used to ensure pump reliability. The results showed that 
there is little to no use of machine-learning methods for selecting optimal strategies and fault detection. The study 
helped identify the blind spots of both pump manufacturers and users, that is, pulp and paper mills, and made the 
necessary recommendations to improve the reliability of centrifugal pumps. Poor maintenance, misalignment of CP 
components, lack of lubrication of bearings and seals, poor installation of the base plate, use of incorrect seal 
arrangement, poor design of the pump system and its components, and ingress of foreign objects into the pump system 
are the main causes of CP failure. The study was based on a single paper mill. Future research should include more 
companies and benchmark strategies to improve CP reliability in the global market.

Abstract 
The study examines engineering students' opinions on the effects of mandatory SIM card registration on data privacy 
and cybersecurity at a Higher Education Institute in the Philippines. This paper examines data privacy and 
cybersecurity concerns created by mandatory registration in the Philippines after outlining the present state of things 
and the regulation requirements. This paper used survey questionnaires and interviews to study engineering students' 
perceptions by investigating complex interrelationships and assessing observed and latent variables, Structural 
Equation Modeling was used to explain the occurrences. Findings show a substantial association between mandatory 
SIM card registration, data privacy, and cybersecurity. Results illustrate how crucial it is to monitor the negative 
consequences of this registration requirement on engineering students' digital security at universities, as there are 
numerous interrelated ways it might endanger their safety.

1. Introduction
This current study titled ""Perceived Impact of Mandatory SIM Card Registration on Cybersecurity and Data Privacy 
among Engineering Students at Higher Education Institution,"" has the same name as a 2018 paper by the Foundation 
for Media Alternatives called MANDATORY SIM CARD REGISTRATION. The authors of both studies are 
concerned about the effects this policy might have on people's right to privacy and the general security of the internet. 
Enforcing SIM card registration as a means of safeguarding personal information and mitigating cyber threats is a 
prevalent fallacy. Both investigations disprove this. They also demonstrate the critical nature of collaboration between 
the government, telecommunications corporations, and other interested parties in order to safeguard privacy and 
maintain the security of the internet. Both studies emphasize the criticality of striking an equilibrium between people's 
right to privacy and security measures in order to create a secure online environment. 
In contrast, our research offered precise suggestions for implementing security-enhancing measures, including two-
factor authentication and encryption, that do not infringe upon privacy rights. The Foundation Media Alternatives 
paper, on the other hand, failed to provide recommendations for attaining this equilibrium. Furthermore, the 
significance of educating individuals about the potential hazards associated with disclosing personal information and 
building awareness regarding optimal strategies for online safety was underscored in our research. We can guarantee 
the protection of privacy rights and the efficient mitigation of security threats in the era of digital technology by

the pros and cons of asking engineering students to register their SIM cards. Strong cybersecurity policies are needed 
to protect sensitive data from obligatory registration (Johnson et al. 2020). The mandate also improved campus safety 
and teacher engagement. A thorough comprehension of the study's conclusions required careful data analysis (Garcia 
and Patel 2021). Interpretation enabled thorough investigation and valuable discoveries. These findings are significant 
for research and decision-making. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
 Latent variables like Perceived Risks and Benefits, Specific Advantages, Specific Concerns, and Behavioral Change 
are quantified by loadings. Observable and latent variables correlate positively if variables have high standardized 
regression estimates. Structure model estimations show a positive relationship between Perceived Risks and Benefits, 
Particular Concerns, Particular Advantage, and Behavioral Change. Standardized regression estimates reveal these 
associations' nature and direction. RMSEA, CFI, NFI, RMR, TLI, GFI, and Chi-Square/df show that the structural 
model fits the data well.  
 
GFI, TLI, CFI, and RMSEA all meet or exceed the cutoffs, while Chi-Square/df is somewhat higher. Since the 
modified model matches the data, the hypothesized latent-observable variable relationships make sense. Risks and 
benefits, anxieties, advantages, and behavior change are positively correlated and consistent with reasonable 
conclusions given the findings. High loadings in the measurement model indicate that the observed variables measure 
the expected latent constructs. 
 
The survey found that engineering students from Higher Education Institution (HEI) must register their SIM cards, 
which offers pros and cons for data privacy and cybersecurity. Results showed that students agreed with campus 
communication and security benefits. Mandatory registration raised concerns about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and 
personal data exposure. These results support the research's main goal by showing how SIM card registration affects 
Engineering students' cybersecurity and data privacy views. Engineering students were surveyed on the pros and cons 
of mandatory SIM card registration. Population views on cybersecurity and data privacy vary. Engineering students 
worried about data privacy and cybersecurity, citing privacy intrusions.  
 
The research examined SIM card registration's effects on engineering students, telecommunications companies, and 
the Philippine government, as well as national security, infrastructure, and SIM card users' rights and responsibilities. 
SIM card registration by Higher Education Institution (HEI) engineering students highlighted academic cybersecurity 
and data privacy issues by showing how the pros and cons interact.  HEI Engineering students' SIM card registration 
showed research cybersecurity and data privacy issues' complicated benefits and downsides.  
 
5.1. Recommendations 
HEI engineering students' mandatory SIM card registration raises cybersecurity and data privacy concerns. 
Encryption, security audits, and focused student teaching on cybersecurity dangers and data protection will achieve 
this aim. In the Philippines, the government, telecommunications businesses, schools, and student groups must 
communicate more openly and comply with data privacy laws. They should evaluate and create new data security 
policies to keep the internet safe and encourage engineering students to handle data properly. 
 
Further research or model refinement is needed to determine how visible elements affect latent idea exploration. 
Consider elements that need greater attention yet have lower loadings or correlations. Evaluate standardized regression 
estimations' validity.

Abstract 
The present study examines the relationship between Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and Six Sigma 
methodology, recognizing the importance of SMEs in global economies. It is difficult for SMEs to seamlessly 
implement new processes due to a lack of resources. Developed in the manufacturing sector, Six Sigma emerges as a 
systematic approach to defect minimization. It is, however, critical to navigate the challenges SMEs face strategically 
in order to integrate successfully. Using an extensive literature review from 2012 to 2023, this paper examines the 
challenges and opportunities of implementing Six Sigma in SMEs. Using existing research, the paper synthesizes 
frameworks, models, and best practices for implementing Six Sigma in SMEs. A comprehensive resource will be 
established for Six Sigma implementation in SMEs, addressing the literature gap specific to SME contexts. Using 
systematic literature reviews, the paper answers key research questions and identifies Six Sigma implementation 
models and frameworks. A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of recent models is presented in the results and 
discussion section. To conclude, the paper emphasizes the importance of inclusive models for SME growth and 
encourages future research to expand its scope.

1. Introduction
Today, SMEs and the Six Sigma methodology are increasingly intertwined in business landscapes. A small and 
medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) is an integral part of the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation 
and economic growth (Lande, Seth, & Shrivastava, 2022; Soltani Nejad Roodabadi & Bhandari , 2023-1-a) based on 
factors such as manpower strength, capital investment, and turnover. Soltani Nejad Roodabadi & Bhandari, 2023-1-
b, argue that SMEs face unique challenges, including limited financial and human resources, making it difficult for 
them to introduce new processes and technologies. In order to remain competitive in the global market, SMEs must 
continually seek innovative approaches to enhance their operational efficiency and enhance their competitiveness 
(Soltani Nejad Roodabadi & Bhandari, 2023-2).

companies in developed countries. A noteworthy concern is the lack of research devoted to Six Sigma in SMEs in the 
United States, despite SMEs accounting for 99 percent of the country's manufacturing sector. There is a dearth of 
studies that address the specific challenges faced by SMEs in the United States. Therefore, more research is needed in 
this area to provide practical insights that facilitate Six Sigma implementation in SMEs. 
 
This study underscores the untapped potential of Six Sigma methodologies for SMEs, emphasizing the need for 
tailored approaches and extensive research to facilitate their successful integration and address the unique challenges 
faced by these enterprises. Unlocking the full benefits of Six Sigma can be a transformative step towards enhancing 
SME operational efficiency and overall competitiveness, as they continue to drive economic growth.

Abstract 
Most studies and organisations recommend the value chain approach as a tool for alleviating poverty within rural 
villages. The study argues that the lack of employment and infrastructure is caused by the unwillingness of firms, 
farmers and tertiary sectors to integrate. The study assesses the processes for integrating firms, agricultural 
cooperatives and retail cooperatives into a global supply chain using the value chain approach. Multiple case study 
strategies are conducted at Kgarose Kgaros Pty Ltd, agricultural cooperatives and the primary retail cooperatives. The 
study reveals that Kgarose Kgaros Pty Ltd, a manufacturer of sweet potato yoghurt in Limpopo Province, is currently 
limited to supplying only two small retail stores in Polokwane due to capacity constraints. The company missed 
significant opportunities to supply larger retailers like Shoprite and Woolworths, as it could not meet Shoprite's high-
volume demand and lacked detailed nutrient information for Woolworths. For optimal operation, the study highlights 
that Kgarose Kgaros Pty Ltd requires a substantial investment of R115 million. The qualitative data was collected 
through interviews, company reports and online magazines. The study used in-depth case study analysis to analyse 
the three cases which have been included in the study due to the complexity of the study, as the three organisations 
are made up of an agro-processing sole trader, agro-processor smallholders and the primary cooperative.

1. Introduction
The micro-enterprise Kgarose Kgaros Pty Ltd is a manufacturer of sweet potato yoghurt. It was founded by a young 
man who grew up in the rural village called Ga-Lekgothoane within the Capricorn District in Limpopo Province of 
South Africa. In Ga-Lekgothoane in 2011, the population size was 1 156 black South Africans of which 641 were 
females and 515 were males (StatsSA, 2011). Of these residents, 98.70% had Sepedi as their first language. The village 
then consisted of 278 households. 
The founder and brainchild of sweet potato yoghurt was Edward Molatelo Kgarose who grew up experiencing all the 
disadvantages that most young people came across as a result of growing up in a rural village. The challenges that

alcohol. The business will also use the vegetable to produce fertilisers that will then be sold back to farmers to fertilise 
their fields. Kgarose Kgaros Pty Ltd has an opportunity to utilise the sweet potato and fill the gap where research 
states the sweet potato is not fully utilised. 
 
Using the by-products from the same sweet potato that is used to produce the sweet potato yoghurt is a very good 
initiative, especially in ensuring that the by-products of the raw material are used to make other products. The business 
may consider its packaging to make it environmentally friendly and also find a way of recovering its end-of-use 
packages. Instead of being packaged with non-biodegradable materials, the yoghurt may be packaged with a material 
that is easily recycled and biodegradable at the same time.  
 
For future research studies the authors suggest that such kinds of businesses require action research as a way of 
collaborating with farmers and manufacturers while ensuring sustainable supply chain management, internally and 
externally. Farming remains the most vulnerable market when it comes to sustainability due to farmworkers still living 
under the level of poverty despite intervention. The good part of Kgarose’s thinking is that he might extend his 
business by producing pumpkin juice in the future.  
 
There are so many advantages that will benefit the villagers in the areas of the Kgarose Kgarose Pty Ltd initiative. 
The pumpkin cultivar that Kgarose has identified is good for farming in the Sekhukhune and Capricorn districts. These 
districts are located mostly in an arid region with unpredictable rainfall. The farmers may plough both the sweet potato 
and the pumpkin or for a change in the season, they may plough sweet potato root in a certain season and pumpkin in 
another season. Farming concurrently will be advantageous for the farmers, as they will not run out of cash. As for 
Kgarose Kgaros Pty Ltd, it will run throughout the year instead of being a seasonal business.

Abstract 
Transportation electrification is one of the most effective ways to reduce the emission pollution in metropolitans. For 
this reason, the government of many of countries defined an incentive based policies to increase the penetration of 
electric vehicles in the cities, especially in large cities. Although the electric vehicles can have a positive impact of 
emission reduction, their development have some strong challenges that should be considered in roadmap designing 
process. The electric vehicles have various strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) that need to be 
analyzed. In this paper, the SWOT analysis of electric vehicles will be carried out from technical, economic, and 
environmental perspectives. The challenges of electric vehicles integration on electricity networks will be investigated 
and the practical solutions to address these challenges will be presented. Moreover, from the economic perspective, 
the market challenges from the buyers, manufactures, and governments points of view will be analyzed. Finally, the 
impact of electric vehicles on emission reduction will be studied and the practical ways to increase their positive 
impacts will be presented.

Abstract 
The research brings a modern and global scenario of the need for industries to connect to new technologies. In the 
context addressed, the use of Industry 4.0 technologies linked to the Supply Chain is proposed. One of the biggest 
impacts caused by Industry 4.0 will be a change that will affect the market as a whole. Basically, the creation of new 
business models. In an increasingly demanding market, many companies are already looking to integrate the specific 
needs and preferences of each customer into the product. Prior product customization by consumers tends to be an 
additional variable in the manufacturing process, but smart factories will be able to take the personalization of each 
customer into account, adapting to preferences. Finally, it can be concluded that connection between Industry 4.0 and 
Supply Chain can growth together, considering the high demand for process efficiency, reduction of lead time, 
optimization in operational flows, better communication and other topics. 
Keywords 
Internet of Things, Logistics 4.0, Connectivity, Industry 4.0 and Supply Chain. 
1. Introduction
The supply chain consists of several correlated and self-dependent areas, which work in harmony so that the flow of 
all stages of operations is integrated, fluid and optimized. Industry 40 is a concept that proposes a disruptive change 
in the industry, with a view to the integration between devices and systems and process improvement. Both are 
important topics to study and development of new resources. The topic is also of interest to logistics companies and 
professionals working in this area, due to the high level of complexity of production chains and the need for 
increasingly integrated devices, so that they can generate reliable and efficient information. 
The areas of the supply chain can be considered interdependent, as they work in alliance with each other. When one 
of them is starting the process, there are certainly others already in flow or at the end of the course. The processes 
resist each other and move forward as the previous and subsequent ones move forward. That's why Supply Chain is 
such an intriguing area with so many opportunities for development. In this work, some concepts and opinions of 
some selected authors will be shown, giving a strong understanding of what is currently thought about Supply Chain 
and the need to connect with Industry 4.0 technologies. 
To achieve the objectives proposed in this work, a survey was carried out using bibliographic reviews of papers by 
renowned authors and demonstrated the result of a more in-depth research on the challenges of the Supply Chain in 
the context of Industry 4.0.  
1.1 Objectives 
The objective for this research is shows the challenges and the urgent need for new resources to disseminate these 
technologies, as well as the breaking down of technical, financial, socio-cultural, environmental and even legal

6. Conclusion 
It can be concluded from this research that there is much to be explored about the use of new Industry 4.0 technologies 
in the Supply Chain. A wide and inviting path of research and studies is open to identify new possibilities of connection 
between technologies, as well as the training of people and companies, so that the use and enjoyment of technologies 
can be available in any sector, including Supply Chain. It also generates an expectation about the benefits that these 
technologies bring when they are part of the supply chain, in addition to the numerous possibilities for innovation, 
efficiency in processes, product improvement and fluidity in communication. In addition, it is possible to highlight 
the visualization of some points of deficiency in the communication system between Industry 4.0 and the Supply 
Chain, expressed as challenges such as breaking down technical, financial, socio-cultural, environmental and even 
legal barriers.

Abstract 
This study focused on assessment of the potential to use waste orange peels extracts as an anti-microbial substance. 
Waste orange peels from a local company were first collected and underwent size reduction in order for them to 
increase the surface area through powder formation. The powder then underwent solid-liquid extraction using water 
whereby the orange peels extract was formed. Afterwards, the orange peels extract was qualitatively analysed for the 
presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, carbohydrates and phenols. 
Further, the potential for use of the orange peels extract as an anti-microbial agent was evaluated at extracts brix 
concentration of 3.6-21.6, shelf time of 7-35 days, pH of 2.1-3.4, temperature of 4-40 oC and orange peels extracts of 
2-12 mL. The orange peels extracts tested positive for tannins, phenolics, carbohydrates, cardial glycoside, saponins
and flavonoids, however, terpenoids were absent. The anti-microbial properties of the orange peels extracts were
optimum at brix 3.6, shelf time of 7 days, pH 2.1, temperature 4 oC and orange peels extracts concentration of 12 mL.
From this study findings, it is important to value-add waste orange peels extracts since they have natural antimicrobial
properties.

1. Introduction
Processed orange fruit waste is a very good example of a wasted resource which has a potential to be used as a raw 
material in the production of fuels, chemicals and other materials (Sharma et. al., 2017). The quantities of whole fruit 
oranges produced globally are around 68 million tons which accounts for about 8.5% of the total fruits which are 
currently been produced globally per annum (Aliyu et al.., 2016). Approximately 42-62% of these oranges are used as 
raw material by fruit juice processing industries. However, after processing 45-60% of these oranges end up as waste 
which usually is of no use for numerous Orange Juice and Oil Processors (Alothman et al., 2016).  
Large quantities of processed orange fruit waste, roughly in the range 15-25 million tons per year are currently been 
produced globally by Orange Juice Processors (Barrales et aal., 2016). The processed orange fruit waste produced 
comprises of orange membrane materials, peels and seeds with peel materials been the major constituent accounting for 
approximately 44% of the waste weight. As a result of these large quantities of orange fruit waste been produced from 
orange juice and oil processing operations, numerous Orange Juice Processors in first world countries have invested in

5.3.4 Effect of Temperature  
For the study of the effects of temperature on the orange peel extract preservative, 15 brix orange juice samples, each 
with 7.5 mL of 43.38 mg/mL orange peel extract were prepared. Each of these sample constituted of 50 mL of orange 
juice. These samples were kept in screw type test tubes at varying temperature conditions of 4 oC, 15 oC, 15 oC, 25 
oC, 32 oC and 40 oC. This temperature was attained through the use of a refrigerator and incubators. Microbiological 
analysis was done on each of the samples with time for 35 days. The concentration of the bacteria increased in CFU/mL 
over time for the various temperatures with the highest concentration being achieved at 40 oC and 35 days (Figure 6). 
This gave an indication that the anti-microbiology properties of the orange juice extracts were highest at low 
temperature of 4 oC and shelf life of 7 days.

6. Conclusion 
Waste orange peels extracts are a good raw material source for the production of natural and organic anti-oxidants 
anti-microbiology substances. Waste orange peels are rich in tannins, phenolics, alkaloids, carbohydrates, cardial 
glycoside, saponins and flavonoids which are good constituencies of natural anti-oxidants and anti-microbiology 
substances. Orange peels extracts as a good source of anti-microbiology substances optimally inhibit bacteria growth 
at brix concentration of 3.6, pH of 2.1, temperature of 4 oC, shelf life of 7 days a. Waste orange peels can be value 
added to orange peels extracts that can be used as an anti-microbiology substance under control conditions.

Abstract 
Medicine availability is a concern in low and middle-income countries hospitals, contributing to delayed treatment, 
out-of-pocket purchases, and deaths. Supply chains moving medicines are deemed weak, preventing on-time and 
continuous supply and availability in hospitals. There is a lack of studies using simulation to capture the complex 
nature of medicine supply chains, dealing with uncertainties and dynamisms, having separate agents with individual 
rules governing their operations; a decision made by one agent affects the entire system's performance. Using a case 
study of Uganda's public health care sector, our study evaluates the medicine supply chain using Discrete Event 
Simulation and Agent-based modelling to improve service delivery. Also, the model examines the effectiveness of 
various interventions in ensuring continuous supply and availability of medicines to all public hospitals in Uganda. 
Observation and unstructured interviews with supply chain personnel inform model conceptualisation using process 
mapping and Overview Design Development protocol. The two conceptual models are a basis for building a hybrid 
model. Model verification and validation using expert opinions, debugging, facility records, and sensitivity analysis 
will be done in later stages of research to ensure usefulness and increase user confidence. Our research develops an 
understanding of how to organise a supply chain and allows for generalisation across low-middle-income countries. 
Based on the model output derived from different interventions, healthcare policymakers can make data-driven 
decisions as a step forward to achieving UN SDG 3 of good health and well-being, specifically 3.3 to achieve Universal 
Health Coverage and access to essential medicines.

Abstract 
Return merchandise authorization (RMA) provides a tremendous impact on product quality, customer satisfaction, 
and the level of customer loyalty and retention. In this work, increased attention is given to the supply chain process 
sustainability, generally, and the RMA process, specifically. This paper explains the effort spent on developing and 
improving the RMA process for an electronic manufacturing company in the USA. This includes building the process 
flow, Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) linkage, organizational chart, releasing standard 
operating procedure (SOP), designing structural layout, building the communication channels, defining customer 
induced damage (CID) and vendor induced damage (VID) regulations, and building the proper computer integrated 
manufacturing system (CIMS) to monitor and control the built process.

1. Introduction
From the early 2000s, the field of sustainable operations management emerged as a way to bring supply chain 
economics, social issues, and environmental concerns together under one umbrella (Sultan et al. 2023). The main 
drivers for this focus on supply chain sustainability were the rapid pace of production and consumption aided by 
advanced technologies, and the increasing customers’ demands.  
The triple bottom line (TBL) aspects of economic prosperity, environmental protection, and societal well-being must 
be taken into account when developing a sustainable RMA process (Metta and Badurdeen 2013). Additionally, a 
holistic and systems-based approach that views the RMA process starting from receiving the product back from the 
customer to either sending it back after repairing, or scrapping it if it is unrepairable, and a cradle-to-cradle philosophy 
for closed loop material flow must also be taken into account. 
Three interdependent factors or subsystems can be taken into account when building a team: a social or people 
subsystem, a technical subsystem consisting of tools, techniques and knowledge, and an environmental subsystem that

Table 1 presents the percentage of PCBAs at each station in the process flow, comparing data from both the old and 
new processes. The findings reveal that, under the old process, no products reached the end of the process; however, 
after the implementation of the new process, all products were successfully packed and shipped back to the customer. 
 
Figure 10 illustrates the cycle time required for each individual PCBA to traverse the process. The observed decline 
in cycle time can be attributed to the learning curve, as the team acclimates to the work over time. Additionally, the 
new process initially shared resources with the forward process until dedicated resources were established.

5. Conclusions  
An improved and automated RMA process for an electronic manufacturing company in the USA was developed and 
integrated into the business operations. The CIMS was programmed and developed to match the physical RMA 
process. SAP was created to match the customer’s SAP network. Later, CIMS was attached to SAP to ensure any 
receiving in or shipping out of the system is recorded financially via SAP. The suitable organizational chart was built 
and operators are assigned to each position. The RMA SOP was officially released and the new team got trained upon 
it. The process was implemented on real life and showed its effectiveness.

3.5. Writing and Releasing SOP 
Procedure-level practices with documentation that precisely outline the ""who, why, what, where, when, and how"" of 
a task is to be carried out are referred to as ""SOP” (Schmidt and Pierce 2016). A crucial component of the entire daily 
chores or processing activity is the creation and application of SOPs for critical functions.  An SOP was written and 
released for the built RMA process to standardize the process across the company’s teams and to ensure consistency 
in RMA tasks, reducing variations, and enhancing overall operational efficiency. Quality of the RMA service is also 
maintained and improved by standardizing the RMA process by providing clear guidelines on how tasks should be 
executed.  
 
The SOP starts with explaining the purpose of this process and the reason for documenting the process. Scope, 
references, definitions, responsibilities for each position, materials, equipment, safety and precautions, procedures for 
each task, management view, and record retention are all mentioned in detail in the SOP.  
 
Two versions of the SOP were created. At the beginning of the planning process, a file called “Long-term SOP” was 
shared with the team on a shared drive so whenever a team member has an idea or a detail, they are free to add it. 
Later, another version (the final one) was created by the management depending on the first version that was created 
by the team. The final version was officially released and signed off by each member mentioned in the SOP besides 
the management.  
 
4. Results and Discussion  
In May 2023, the company initiated the reception of the initial batch of RMA boards from the customer. Managing 
these returned PCBAs proved challenging for the existing team, as overseeing both the forward and reverse processes 
became cumbersome using the same team and machinery. Recognizing the complexity, the company engaged 
researchers to develop a dedicated RMA process. 
 
The newly devised RMA process was integrated into the company's operations and officially implemented on August 
16, 2023. Subsequent to the old team's handling of the returned PCBAs, these items were temporarily stored in the 
warehouse. While some boards underwent testing processes, such as AOI and FBT, they were eventually stockpiled 
until the formation and readiness of the new team. 
 
The new team opted to address the RMA PCBAs under the assumption that they had not been previously handled by 
the old team, considering potential adverse effects from extended storage in the warehouse. Employing the ""First In, 
First Out"" (FIFO) method, the new team utilized a system of inventory valuation and management where the earliest 
items added to inventory were prioritized for use.

Blockchain Application for Value Chain Management in 
Corporate Banking to Enhance Competitive Advantage 
Rowdha Makki and Dr Balan Sundarakani 
University of Wollongong in Dubai, UAE 
Abstract 
A corporate bank specializes in providing a variety of services tailored to the needs of major enterprises and 
corporations, including those in the private and government sectors, rather than catering to individuals, which is known 
as consumer banking. Blockchain technology application and integration allows banks and other financial institutions 
to overcome current inefficiencies, enhance security and transparency whilst remaining ahead of its competitors. 
Furthermore, blockchain integration will reduce the time spent between value chain activities, ultimately reducing 
expenses. The current extent of global technology is swiftly progressing and infiltrating all sectors. Within the 
financial sector, organizations are continuously seeking to create innovative strategies and solutions that priorities the 
needs of their corporate clients while maintaining a strong competitive edge over other firms. Corporate financial 
institutions must strive to maintain competitiveness versus other organizations while also maintaining operational 
efficiency, security, traceability, and openness. Blockchain technology enables corporate financial institutions and 
banks to utilize their services and streamline their internal procedures. Banks can enhance their existing processes, 
including transactions, identity verifications, smart contracts, and internal operations like HR and procurement, 
through the implementation of distributed ledger technology. The advantages of this platform is the secure way to 
conduct cross border payments on a blockchain platform approved by the central bank that has the potential to reduce 
operational costs whilst remaining in compliance with the regulatory bodies. (CBUAE 2021). The application of 
blockchain into the value chain of the CB allows the firm to reposition itself in the market to meet the landscape of 
the evolving banking and finance industry. This exploratory research thesis explored the ways blockchain can be 
implemented into the CB value chain and its respective impact on each value chain activity in order to achieve 
sustained competitive advantage.

Introduction
The current extent of global technology is swiftly progressing and infiltrating all sectors. Within the financial sector, 
organizations are continuously seeking to create innovative strategies and solutions that priorities the needs of their 
corporate clients while maintaining a strong competitive edge over other firms. Corporate financial institutions must 
strive to maintain competitiveness versus other organizations while also maintaining operational efficiency, security, 
traceability, and openness. Blockchain technology enables corporate financial institutions and banks to utilize their 
services and streamline their internal procedures. Banks can enhance their existing processes, including transactions, 
identity verifications, smart contracts, and internal operations like HR and procurement, through the implementation 
of distributed ledger technology.   
A corporate bank specializes in providing a variety of services tailored to the needs of major enterprises and 
corporations, including those in the private and government sectors, rather than catering to individuals, which is known 
as consumer banking. Commercial banking primarily caters to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by offering 
a range of services. Corporate banks provide a variety of services including deposits and lending. Lending alternatives 
offered by the bank, such as loans, bonds, or credit lines, are designed to meet the financial needs of large-scale

the corporate bank and its activities. These risks can come in various forms such as credit risk and investment risk – 
which directly affects both the corporate bank and the client. Risk management works closely with data analytics to 
ensure stability and security of the activities across the corporate bank. Once a risk is identified, it must be analyzed 
and monitored in order to be able to derive a successful strategy to mitigate the risk whilst protecting the interests of 
both the client and the corporate bank. (Kristensen et al 2009). 
 
The support activity following risk management in the corporate bank’s value chain is firm infrastructure which entails 
the management of the organizational systems and processes to ensure effectiveness in a streamlined manner. Effective 
management of a firm’s infrastructure provides the groundwork for successful strategic decision making across 
different levels of the corporate bank. Successful human resource management falls under the firm’s infrastructure. It 
is critical to ensure the talent and skill that are employed by the corporate bank are competent enough to be able to 
support banking operations to ensure the long-term targets of the corporate bank are met. (Odero 2006) 
The final support activity within the value chain of a corporate bank is back office services, which is composed of all 
the administrative activities that are essential for the day to day functioning of the corporate bank. There are several 
functions of this support activity. The first is processing the transactions on the back-end systems whilst ensuring 
accuracy and compliance. This is essential for accounting purposes in order to maintain accurate records to be able to 
prepare statements and reports. Back office services also include documentation activities which include the 
management of documents regarding client accounts and their respective transaction history. Back office services 
require accuracy, integrity and security of the data entries in order to remain compliant and efficient.  (Babadi et al 
2022) 
 
3. Methodology 
3.1 Quantitative analysis 
The gathering, analysis, and interpretation of data in the research field have effectively been influenced by quantitative 
analysis, which is considered a critical element in the research process. The aspect uses statistical and numerical 
approaches to explore and understand varied commercial concepts in the specified environment, including operational 
procedures, financial performances, consumer behaviors, and market trends. Many studies, both in the commercial 
environment and other fields, have adopted the use of quantitative data analysis over the different approaches applied 
in the current business environment based on its real-time capability. This analysis digs deep into the entire aspect of 
quantitative analysis and its application in commercial operations, how advantageous and disadvantageous it is, the 
critical nature of data collection in relation to surveys, and the possible risky aspect linked to quantitative research.  
 
3.2 Survey Data Collection  
Surveys are among the most common methods used in research, especially concerning collecting data. Varied research 
agencies and personnel has normalized the use of survey in data collection due to the wide range of advantages it 
offers to the process. First, there is efficiency in data collection under the survey, an aspect that has aided the 
quantitative research approach. There is a need for little to access a considerable mass of respondents. This is one of 
the aspects that increases the practicality and cost-effectiveness aspects of surveys in quantitative research. Second, 
there is the concept of standardization that surveys have influenced data collection. There is consistency in the 
responses needed and the questions asked in the research to all the persons participating in the study. This enhances 
the uniformity of data and its easy analysis and comparison. (Couper 2017) 
 
Also, the survey is critical in quantitative research data collection because it provides anonymity to the participants. 
This influences candid responses. It is essential to consider individual preferences and opinions and approach sensitive 
topics. The capability of surveys to generate structured data with amenability to quantitative research makes it 
advantageous in the research field. It increases the ease of identifying patterns and trends in data, graphs, and charts 
generation and the performance of statistical analysis. There is some ease in the administration of surveys in data 
collection compared to other methodologies. Their suitability is linked to collecting customer feedback and market 
research due to their ability to reach a diverse and broad audience.  
 
4. Conclusion & Recommendation 
The application of blockchain into the CB would be a new technology adoption, and even though majority of the 
survey participants in this study were accepting of the technology, there may still be some resistance within the 
organization. In order to overcome the resistance, I would recommend the CB to implement change using Kotter’s 8-
step change model in the following steps:  
1510","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
 
© IEOM Society International 
 
1) Create a sense of urgency: The CB can do this by clearly communicating the ways the new technology 
integration will have a positive impact across the division. 
2) Form a coalition: The CB can do this by creating a team made up of different individuals from different 
departments (RM, KYC, Risk, L&C) in order to advocate and guide throughout the process. The CB can also 
use this step to involve stakeholders and address any concerns that may arise.  
3) Create a strategic vision: The CB can do this by allowing the dedicated team to form clear objectives towards 
the integration of the DTL across the division and ensure that these objectives are aligned with the 
organizational targets.  
4) Communication: The CB can do this by creating a platform for communication in a transparent manner and 
implementing an open-door policy to address any queries and questions that may arise.  
5) Identification of obstacles: The CB can do this by assessing the potential barriers that may arise. These 
barriers can be lack of training or the fear of new technology implementation.  
6) Set short term wins: The CB can do this by breaking down the objectives created into smaller objectives so 
that they can have a clear vision of the small successes. This builds confidence within the division as the 
change is implemented.  
7) Build the change: The CB can do this by continuously improving as each objective is met, and slowly 
expanding the DTL integration within the CB. This is also the time where feedback is collected, as it can be 
used to create further improvements  
8) Sustain the changes: The CB can do this by adding new policies that integrate the blockchain technology 
within the organizational culture. The change acceptance can be sustained by recognition of successful 
individuals or departments whose performance metrics improved through the blockchain integration. (Tang 
2019) 
 
I would also recommend that the CB invests in training programs and ensures a guidebook is created that is kept on 
the internal system for employees to refer back to. The training content can be segregated into different modules 
according to the department. In addition, various training methods can be conducted such as workshops, seminars, 
and online courses. A dedicated team should also be set up to assist with the ongoing queries that may arise, especially 
in the early stages or for new staff who don’t have experience with specific systems before. The ongoing support will 
provide the CB employees with further reassurance and there will be a reduction in the resistance (Karim et al 2019). 
The last recommendation I would like to add is CB joining mBridge, which is a platform used by the Central Bank of 
the UAE for cross border payments using digital currencies based on DTL. The central bank has been using this since 
2021. The advantages of this platform is the secure way to conduct cross border payments on a blockchain platform 
approved by the central bank that has the potential to reduce operational costs whilst remaining in compliance with 
the regulatory bodies. (CBUAE 2021) 
 
The application of blockchain into the value chain of the CB allows the firm to reposition itself in the market to meet 
the landscape of the evolving banking and finance industry. This exploratory research thesis explored the ways 
blockchain can be implemented into the CB value chain and its respective impact on each value chain activity in order 
to achieve sustained competitive advantage. DLT is built on transparency and security, which allows the banking 
industry to transform whilst remaining secure of sensitive internal data. This thesis contained discussion on the 
different applications of blockchain across the value chain activity in order to be able to assess how well it can be 
applied. The survey results showed positive responses in terms of technology acceptance and positive predictions for 
the efficiency of the future value chain under the blockchain integration. The increased efficiency of the value chain, 
combined with the enhanced security will increase client satisfaction and trust, resulting in long term relationships 
and the acquisition of new clients to increase the current portfolio of the CB. Streamlined processes and clear audit 
trail also mean that the bank is able to be more complaint with regulations. This is especially crucial because the 
regulatory environment of the financial industry is always evolving and requires banks constantly to remain up to date. 
The process in which new technology is being adopted into an organization is not an easy one, but it can be greatly 
rewarding with the positive impacts it can bring it to the organization and its competitive advantage.

Abstract  
The ever-increasing competitive landscape necessitates manufacturers to seek improvements in operational efficiency 
constantly. This paper explores the integration of various methodologies to enhance operational efficiency at Shams 
Cables Factory. The proposed approach combines lean techniques, conceptual modeling, and process visualization 
tools like facility layout, activity relationship chart (ARC), flow process chart (FPC), and VA/NVA analysis to further 
refine the process by differentiating between value-adding and non-value-adding activities. As a result, these 
integrations allow for targeted efforts to eliminate NVA activities, streamline VA activities, and maximize overall 
efficiency.

1. Introduction
Similar to Kaizen or The Toyota Production System, the principle of continuous improvement known as lean 
manufacturing can be used to describe it. This idea was designed to minimize waste while maximizing resource use. 
After Japan's defeat in World War II, it extends its roots. After World War II, the Japanese automobile industry was 
where lean manufacturing was initially implemented due to a lack of materials, funding, and skilled labor. The ""Toyota 
Production System"" now known as ""Lean Manufacturing"" was created by two highly respected individuals at the 
Toyota Automotive Company, Eiji Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno. Lean management aims to use the process to accomplish 
the goals of high quality, safety, and worker morale while at the same time lowering costs and cutting lead times (N. 
Kumar et al. 2022). Industries use lean manufacturing as an approach to cut waste from manufactured goods. The 
fundamental plan is to reduce the cost of the goods during all phases of production, including designing, fabricating, 
and manufacturing, with the aid of prior business analyses. When designing, the material and financial resources can 
be used to the fullest extent possible. In order to reduce waste, the industry must first identify all forms of hidden 
waste. The engineer will frequently choose the product's well-known, secure, and reliable material over less expensive 
alternatives. As a result, the organization's profit will drop, the engineer will pay more, and the associated economic 
risks will rise (N. Kumar et al. 2022).

6. Conclusions
After analyzing the data, it is clear that the Shams factory has real problems related to the high percentage of NVA 
activities and poor facility layout. In this paper, we apply lean concepts and methodologies to achieve the expected 
results and outcomes. We can significantly improve our operational effectiveness by applying lean concepts and 
analytical instruments. Non-value-added activities (NVA) such as excessive handling, waiting, and rework are the 
goals for removal in lean methodologies. We used a spaghetti chart to provide a clear picture of the flow of materials 
and persons, showing inefficient flow and encouraging layout optimization. Also, the activity relationship chart helped 
us build a streamlined facility layout that reduces distance and needless interactions between processes, resulting in a 
seamless, value-driven operation. By addressing both internal and external flow obstacles, this combined strategy 
enables significant performance benefits that save costs, increase customer satisfaction, and shorten lead times. Keep 
in mind that achieving lean requires continual monitoring and modification. Using these techniques can help you 
maintain optimal operational efficiency.

Abstract 
This study aims to assess the factors influencing the continued usage of e-payment methods using the extended 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in one of the Higher Education Institutions in Quezon City. The study utilized 
a quantitative technique, particularly an online survey, to gather data. The participants of the study have a total of 386 
respondents. After the data collection, the study used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and 
Analysis of Movement Structure (AMOS) for data processing and construction of the Structural Equation Model 
(SEM). The model was used to determine the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, 
perceived security, perceived trust, behavioral intention to use, perceived satisfaction, responsiveness, reliability,  and 
continued usage. The result shows that perceived security had a significant effect on perceived usefulness, 
responsiveness, reliability, and continued usage. Also, results showed that responsiveness had a positive influence on 
perceived usefulness. Moreover, perceived security, perceived usefulness, responsiveness, and reliability had a 
significant impact on the continued usage of e-payment methods among the students of a higher education institution.

1. Introduction
Electronic Payment or E-payment has become a prevalent method for conducting transactions, an alternative way of 
payment when people do not have cash. Electronic payment and e-commerce were implemented during the COVID-
19 pandemic, and until now, people have ratified the use of the system. According to Tun & Razak (2022), e-payment 
has created favorable conditions for industries to thrive, and one sector poised to become more significant is the e-
wallet industry, driven by the increasing preference for contactless payments, swift expansion of the e-wallet market 
in Malaysia and its continued support for a cashless society. The younger generation and consumers are actively 
molding the e-payment and e-commerce landscape, exerting a significant influence on the way online products are 
marketed and how goods are consumed. This impact could encompass aspects like promoting environmentally 
friendly product choices, encouraging responsible consumption habits, and advancing the overall digitization of 
commerce within these nations (Yang et al., 2021). People have made e-payment methods a fundamental part of 
their lifestyles because of the exceptional convenience, variety of choices, enhanced financial access, robust security 
measures, and seamless integration into everyday activities like shopping, bill settlement, and financial planning. 
With ongoing technological advancements, e-payment methods will probably become even more firmly embedded 
in people's daily routines.

6. Conclusion 
The pandemic has led to the widespread use of e-payments such as Gcash, Maya, Online Banking Application, and 
Debit and Credit Cards. One of the Higher Education Institutions in Quezon City started to use e-payments as one 
of the payment methods available. E-payment methods are used in tuition fees, canteen, library, uniforms, 
organization-related activities, and other documents that are payable in the institution.  
 
This research uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with added variables such as reliability and 
responsiveness to assess the factors affecting the perceived satisfaction of students in using e-payment methods inside 
the institution. The survey with 47 questions received a total of 386 responses from the students. The result shows that 
perceived security had a significant effect on perceived usefulness, responsiveness, reliability, and continued usage. 
Also, perceived usefulness was positively influenced by responsiveness. Moreover, perceived security, perceived 
usefulness, responsiveness, and reliability had a significant effect on the continued usage of e-payment methods in the 
institution. When the consumer feels secure with the use of e-payment methods instead of cash, they tend to use it 
more often. When e-payment methods perform their intended use, and how the management responds to the requests 
of the consumer also affects the continued usage of the consumers.

Abstract 
In this research paper, a resource allocation system for a Saudi industry is designed. There is a limited supply of four 
types of equipment in the company's main warehouse, which is causing equipment utilization problems. There are 13 
ongoing sites where the equipment is transported and used. Instead of using the available equipment, project managers 
rent these items. As a result, the company incurs an avoidable cost. For the selected Saudi industry, the problem is 
identified, objectives are established, constraints are also identified, and the data was collected from the company, 
filtered, and analyzed. Two alternative solutions have been developed for each type of equipment using transportation 
models, lowest cost method, and mathematical models. In addition to developing a complete resource allocation 
system, the testing, validation, cost analysis, and recommendations for the company were conducted. After the 
analysis, the optimum solution for resource allocation problem was found, where all the analysis was done using XLS 
sheet solution to trace the system for optimum solution. The XLS sheet solution was used to analyze the data and 
identify the best allocation of resources. The findings were then used to create a plan to implement the new resource 
allocation system. Finally, the new system was recommended for the company to be put into operation. 
Keywords 
Resource Allocation, Equipment Utilization, Mathematical Modelling, Transportation Models and Least Cost Method.  
1. Introduction
This research is critical for firms dealing with equipment that needs to be allocated to projects or sites effectively. It 
is intended to benefit the selected Saudi industry and other companies with similar networks. The application of this 
project is allocating resources and facilities based on supply, demand, distances, and cost. The solution generated in 
this paper is intended for global use. This solution was designed for one of the leading firms in the industry with actual 
data and will contribute to effective resource allocation and significant cost reduction. A Projects Regional Manager 
at the selected Saudi industry is dealing with a facility utilization issue. The company owns different types of 
equipment: compactors, crane trucks, excavators, and dump trucks with a supply of 15, 15, 5, and 10 respectively in 
the main warehouse. The equipment are sometimes needed in different locations around the country at the same time. 
The company relies on renting the requested equipment if all are occupied at different locations. It was also noticed 
that some of the equipment are held at certain locations for a long period of time without being used, and that other 
sites have to rent the same equipment to avoid any delay. This issue is adding an avoidable cost to the company. So, 
there is a need for an effective resource allocation system at the selected Saudi industry.

the track devices, such as weak authentication mechanisms or data encryption flaws. It ensures that the devices are 
resistant to unauthorized access, data breaches, and tampering. 
 
The resource allocation system was validated by using real-world data obtained from the client to ensure its accuracy 
and reliability. By using representative data sets that reflect the actual usage patterns and allocation requirements of 
the system, and eventually comparing the system outputs with expected results and manually verify the correctness of 
the allocations. After a series of fine tuning the system to reach the desired result, it was evident that the real data 
input led to an output that matched the theoretical expectation. This means that the system’s output is validated. Track 
devices generate a significant amount of data that is crucial for fleet management operations. Data validation involves 
verifying the accuracy, completeness, and integrity of the data collected by the devices. It ensures that the data is 
reliable and can be effectively utilized for decision-making and analysis.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In this research, a resource allocation system has been designed that allows the user to enter inputs and generates 
alternative solutions based on these inputs. This system was built based on the selected Saudi industry’s real data. 
After data filtration and analysis, an interface was developed and a complete system was designed accordingly. The 
transportation system and allocation schedule were included in the resource allocation system, in which the program 
displayed the allocation of equipment in respective sites. Two tracking systems were provided and included in the 
alternative solutions to meet the objectives fully. 
The designed transportation models and the interface can be effectively be used to perform the following functions: 
• 
Allowing the flexibility in inputs for the demand and resources 
• 
Allocate the desired equipment for a specific location 
• 
Determination of the transportation cost of individual equipment 
• 
Determination of the overall cost of the solution 
• 
Tracking and the availability of a certain equipment

Abstract 
The primary aim of this study is to investigate the convergent and discriminant validity of injunctive and descriptive 
norms in forming subjective norms. It also examines the influence of subjective norms, encompassing normative 
beliefs (injunctive and descriptive norms) and the motivation to comply, on the intention to consume Amino 2000 
supplements among fitness enthusiasts in Indonesia. This research, employing a mixed-method approach combining 
qualitative and quantitative analyses, was conducted in four major Indonesian cities: Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, and 
Semarang. The study sample comprised 393 fitness aficionados from five distinct fitness centers across the region. 
The findings support four hypotheses posited by the researcher. Overall, subjective norms, including normative beliefs 
(injunctive and descriptive norms) and motivation to comply, more effectively predict and explain the intention of 
fitness mania to consume Amino 2000 supplements, compared to either injunctive norms, descriptive norms, a 
combination of both, or the normative beliefs formed by these norms, along with the constituent motivation to comply. 
Keywords 
Subjective norms, Injunctive norms, Descriptive norms, Mixed method, and Fitness mania. 
1. Introduction
The lifestyle of 'fitness mania', integrating physical exercise, regular diet, and rest, is increasingly synonymous with 
awareness of sports supplements' benefits for achieving fitness goals, muscle building, and weight loss (Ajzen & 
Fishbein, 1980; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). Among these, Amino 2000 supplements, often used by bodybuilders and 
athletes for muscle recovery and growth, have gained popularity (Schiffman & Kanuk, 2010). In Indonesia, 
particularly in cities like Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, and Semarang, the consumption of Amino 2000 is evident

6. Conclusion 
This study effectively fulfills its primary goal by establishing the convergent and discriminant validity of injunctive 
and descriptive norms in the formation of subjective norms, a key finding substantiated by the factor analysis results 
presented in Tables 1 and 2. The attainment of discriminant validity, as outlined by Aaker et al. (2011), is evidenced 
when the measurements of a construct do not correlate with those of a distinct construct. Similarly, Hair et al. (2010) 
and Sekaran (2010) posit that discriminant validity is present when a construct is unequivocally distinct from other 
theoretical constructs. In accordance with the criteria set by Hair et al. (2010), this study regards factor loading values 
exceeding 0.50 as significant. The confirmatory factor analysis in Table 1, where factor loading values for each 
indicator across all constructs exceed 0.5, attests to robust discriminant validity. Moreover, the Average Variance 
Extracted (AVE) value exceeding 0.5 in Table 2 indicates a strong convergent validity, further validating the 
construction of the fieldwork (Hair et al., 2010). 
 
Crucially, the study reveals that subjective norms—encompassing both normative beliefs (injunctive and descriptive 
norms) and the motivation to adhere—exert a significant and positive influence on the intention to use Amino 2000 
supplements among fitness enthusiasts in four cities. Given the respondents' limited direct comprehension of 
subjective norms, the research pivoted to an indirect measurement approach. Regression analysis elucidates that 
subjective norms, composed of normative beliefs and motivation to comply, significantly and positively affect the 
intention to use these supplements. 
 
The findings also indicate that subjective norms, including both normative beliefs and motivation to adhere, are more 
efficacious in predicting and explaining the consumption intentions of fitness enthusiasts for Amino 2000 supplements 
than merely relying on injunctive norms, descriptive norms, or their collective combination. This observation is 
congruent with Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior, highlighting the imperative of a profound understanding 
of subjective norms for accurately predicting and influencing health-related behaviors, especially in the realm of 
fitness supplement usage (Ajzen, 1991; Hair et al., 2010). 
 
In summary, this study not only elucidates the intricate dynamics of subjective norms in the context of health 
supplement consumption but also significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge within the domain of 
consumer behavior and health psychology.

Abstract 
Railway capacity ensures effective transportation, supports economic growth and promotes social welfare. With Saudi 
Arabia witnessing rapid economic growth and urbanization, enhancing the railway system's capacity to meet 
escalating transportation needs is crucial. This project has investigated and addressed Saudi Arabia Railways delay 
causes specifically in the North railway passenger line, with the aim of improving capacity and creating a more 
efficient and reliable transportation system. The project aims to enhance the signalling system of Saudi Arabia 
Railways by optimizing train spacing which allows for more trains to operate safely on a given track. A simulation 
model of a part of the railway network was built and implemented using ARENA software. An improved model was 
made by adding a new marker board to adjust the size of the section. This improved model makes it easier to analyse 
the various factors that influence the decision to add a marker board, thereby contributing to the overall effectiveness 
of the train system.

The Vision Realization Programs (VRPs) are the driving force behind Vision 2030, working to bring the vision to life. 
Each VRP has a specific roadmap with approved delivery plans, focused on meeting specific objectives and key 
performance indicators within five years. As Vision 2030 evolves to meet the changing needs of Saudi Arabia, the 
VRPs adapt and align with these needs to ensure Vision 2030 is successfully achieved. The logistics industry plays a 
crucial role in the Kingdom's current transport system due to its advantageous geographical location on global trade 
routes and its strong and developing economy. The improvement of railway capacity can contribute to the reduction 
of delays and the improvement of the overall efficiency and performance of the railway system. In addition, delays 
can have a significant impact on railway capacity as they reduce the number of trains that can run on a given line. 
Furthermore, Figure 1 shows the general delay causes that can occur in any railways, in order to identify the areas for 
improvement and implement strategies to minimize delays and improve overall efficiency.  
This project will focus specifically on enhancing the efficiency of the signalling system by studying signalling block 
systems, which allow railways to run safely and effectively by averting train collisions. 
1.1 Objectives  
To ensure efficient transport and to promote sustainable economic growth and social welfare, railway capacity plays 
a crucial role. Increasing rail capacity can help reduce delays and improve overall rail system efficiency and 
performance.

The network map which represents part of the whole North railway line starting from Riyadh to R1 (R1 is an area 
between Riyadh and Majmaah) as shown in Figure 6.  
 
The map determines the specific location for each marker board in addition to the speed change points. Using this 
information, the distance has been calculated to help construct the model. Figure 7 represents the model of the current 
railway situation from Riyadh to R1.  
 
A create module represents the trigger of the railway track, the entity represents the train which is created with an 
interarrival time of 20 minutes and a maximum of 5 trains. Taking into account that the entity will be created only if 
the number of trains waiting in the first hold queue equals zero, to avoid train clustering in one point. The stations are 
used to address a physical or logical location such as the Entry, Changing Speed, and the Marker Board. Moreover, 
the distance between stations is specified in the distance spreadsheet module. The transport module is responsible for 
transferring the train from one station to another at a specified velocity. A transport module requires a request module 
to assign a transporter to an entity and requires a free module to release the transporter. The decide module checks if 
the stations are empty, if not the train will wait at the hold until a signal. A signal module is responsible for giving the 
held train a sign so it can enter the section. The record module is used to collect the total waiting time at each hold 
module. The trains will exit through the dispose module.  
 
5.4 Proposed Improvements  
To address the relationship between the waiting time of trains and adding additional marker boards, the improved 
model was constructed as shown in Figure 8.  
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, enhancing the Saudi railway signalling system is crucial for improving the overall safety, efficiency, 
and reliability of the railway network in the country. The project has investigated several key delay causes that Saudi 
railways faces, the main focus was on enhancing the signalling system which is one of the critical root causes of delay. 
By enhancing the signalling system, the number of trains that can run safely on a given track can be increased by

Abstract 
As products progress towards the end user in a standard supply chain, numerous firms are starting to acknowledge the 
significance of reverse logistics. Reverse logistics takes care of the return products to suppliers or vendors. In the 
return merchandise authorization (RMA) process, one of the main steps that decides the cost of repairing is to ascertain 
whether the damage is customer induced damage (CID) or vendor induced damage (VID). In this paper, a 
comprehensive computational procedure using Python and various libraries, including Pillow (PIL), NumPy, and 
SciPy was implemented in an electronic manufacturing company to automate and optimize the process of making the 
CID vs. VID decision.  
Keywords 
Python, Pillow (PIL), customer induced damage (CID), vendor induced damage (VID), and return merchandise 
authorization (RMA). 
1. Introduction
In a typical supply chain paradigm, materials or services conventionally progress from suppliers to customers in a 
forward-moving direction. Businesses have historically focused their endeavors on this forward-moving supply chain 
to reduce cycle times, minimize costs, and improve customer service. Nevertheless, certain business operations 
necessitate the movement of materials in the opposite direction—specifically, from customers back to suppliers. 
Instances of this reverse flow include the return of new materials or the returning of used materials for recycling, 
refurbishing, or salvaging. This counter-directional movement is formally recognized as reverse logistics (Retzlaff-
Rober and Frolick 1997). 
The contemporary challenges within the supply chain encompass concerns such as reverse logistics, product pricing 
strategies, and the environmental impact of pollutants. In their pursuit of providing customers with the best value, 
supply chains consistently strive to optimize costs while ensuring product quality. Consequently, it is imperative for 
each supply chain to formulate a judicious product pricing policy to remain competitive in the market. To achieve

After the successful implementation of the proposed automated image analysis process, which involves importing 
both “Before” and “After” images and executing the programmed code, notable efficiency improvements were 
observed. Importing both images was accomplished within approximately 10 seconds. Subsequently, running both 
images through the programmed codes was observed to take between 15-40 seconds, depending on the size of the 
imported images. As a result, the total time required for CID/VID decision-making was significantly reduced to a 
range of 25-55 seconds.

4.2 Graphical Results 
Figure 4 presents a crucial case study exemplifying the effectiveness of the proposed automated image analysis process 
in a real-world scenario. The study began with the capture and storage of an AOI image of a PCBA before its shipment. 
Upon its return, prompted by customer-reported failures, a second AOI image was acquired to identify any 
discrepancies. This automated process replaces a previously manual, operator-dependent procedure that was both 
time-consuming and susceptible to oversights, potentially leading to missed differences and increased rework costs. 
 
The adoption of the automated method signifies a significant leap forward. Rapid detection of differences at a pixel 
scale is now achieved within seconds. As depicted in Figure 4, the automated analysis precisely delineated the 
disparities between the pre-shipment (Figure 4, left) and post-return (Figure 4, right) images. Notably, the identified 
failure was attributed to bent pins in the BGA socket, a problem likely arising from mishandling during shipping or 
customer mishandling. This conclusion was drawn through a meticulous comparison with the AOI images of the

outgoing board, revealing intact pins. This finding underscores the heightened accuracy and efficiency of the 
automated process in pinpointing specific issues that might have eluded manual inspections.

5. Conclusions 
A computational procedure leveraging Python and modules such as Pillow (PIL), NumPy, and SciPy was implemented 
within a PCBA manufacturing company to automate the CID/VID decision-making station in the RMA process. The 
decision-making time was reduced from an average of 6.2 minutes to under one minute for an example PCBA. 
Furthermore, the automated process demonstrated an enhancement in decision quality by eliminating the human factor 
from the decision-making process.   
 
The implementation encountered challenges attributed to variations in the lighting conditions of the AOI images. It 
became evident that a more stringent control over AOI lighting was imperative to mitigate the potential introduction 
of discrepancies between the old and new images. Such discrepancies, if not adequately addressed, had the potential 
to be erroneously identified as defects in this program. Therefore, the need for enhanced control over AOI lighting 
emerged as a critical aspect to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the automated image analysis process.

Abstract 
This study examines how pandemic-induced workplace changes affect employee engagement at Company X in South 
Africa. Global work structures have changed dramatically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The University of 
Johannesburg's Sambil Charles Mukwakungu, Ncedo Khoza, and Charles Mbohwa studied remote work and 
organizational resilience's effects on employee engagement. All 24 Company X employees are interviewed for the 
grounded theory study. Majority of employees understand the company's goals, but retention strategies and the work 
environment can be improved. The COVID-19 pandemic has hurt employee engagement, necessitating customized 
solutions. Transparent communication, leadership support, and a positive work environment boost employee 
engagement and resilience, according to the study. Company X should prioritize leadership, openness, and safety and 
interaction. Development of skills and international exposure are suggested to strengthen the emotional and 
intellectual bond between employees and the company. The study recommends industry-wide comparisons and 
demographic diversification to better understand employee engagement dynamics during health crises. Triangulation 
methods like surveys and observations can improve future findings.

1. Introduction
According to Kelly (2011), pandemics, which are characterized by fast and widespread increases in disease incidence, 
have historically imposed substantial consequences on the economy and people of many countries across the world. 
Among the most notable instances are the Black Death, which occurred between the years 1352 and 1374 and wiped 
out a sizeable section of the population, and the Spanish Flu, which occurred between 1918 and 1919 and corresponded 
with the conclusion of World War I and affected roughly 500 million people (Dean et al., 2017; Matthews, 2014; 
Garrett, 2007). Shereen et al.'s (2020) research highlights that the ongoing pandemic, caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome and belonging to the family of Coronaviridae viruses, serves as a notable illustration of a 
comparable worldwide health catastrophe. This epidemic has been responsible for enormous changes in the structures 
of society and the economy, and technology has played a vital role in the management and adaptation of these changes 
(Adnan Shereen et al., 2020). 
Employee engagement (EE), which is sometimes misunderstood as only employee happiness, is a more profound 
psychological commitment in which workers are inspired to accomplish extraordinary achievements and contribute 
to the goals of the organization (Kincentric, 2019). Although its significance is widely acknowledged, the levels of 
global involvement continue to be low, with just 13% of the workforce being actively involved (Mann and Harter, 
2016). The arrival of a pandemic makes these difficulties much more difficult to manage, which may have the potential 
to have long-term repercussions for the dynamics of the organization and the level of employee engagement (Donthu 
and Gustafsson, 2020).

Abstract 
Supply chain management has become a real challenge due to ever accelerating technological innovations and 
organizations must not only aim to optimize supply chain processes, but also to build trust in all links of the supply 
network due to increased competition and supply chain expansion. Organizations need to implement an appropriate 
system that will improve efficiency and customer service, meet business objectives, and increase profitability. The 
purpose of this article is to illustrate how blockchain technology can improve traceability and supply chain efficiency 
by impacting business productivity. The conceptual framework of this research work is developed through a 
systematic literature review on the impact of the application of blockchain technology in supply chains. The Prisma 
methodology was used, obtaining 78 articles as references. The results show that blockchain technology has the 
potential to improve traceability and efficiency throughout the supply chain through cost reduction and 
decentralization of information. Finally, it was concluded that this leads to improved productivity of companies and a 
higher level of reliability with their stakeholders. This article adds to the literature on blockchain in the supply chain 
by focusing the research on the impact on traceability and efficiency.

1. Introduction
With the development of international trade and economic globalization, logistics has become increasingly important 
in global partnerships (Hackius and Petersen 2020). Along with the development, problems related to information 
exchange, coordination, communication, decision making, and time management arise. Technological changes and 
globalization are factors that make supply chain management more difficult (Saberi et al. 2021). 
With the expansion and development of an organization, problems arise that become apparent in supply chain 
management, mainly because of the lack of trust between nodes or links, product traceability and process optimization 
(Liu et al. 2023). The methodological implementation of a new supply chain management system is necessary, if

Abstract 
This paper addresses a study on architecture students regarding the effect of sleep quality and various factors that 
affect their academic performance. The study was inspired by the lack of analysis done on architecture students 
regarding their sleep quality, which significantly affects their performance in school. The lack of sleep or poor sleep 
quality also affects the person's ability to function correctly. Quantitative methods, which utilized multivariate 
regression analysis to test the relationship between the two variables and numerous factors, were utilized in this study. 
Surveys were also distributed to gather data. The study had a sample size 221 from a population size of 2,128 recently 
enrolled architecture students. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was utilized using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package 
for the Social Sciences) Statistics, a software package to determine the relationship between sleep deprivation and 
students' academic performance. The study measured the seven components of sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI). The research findings show that all the respondents had poor sleep quality. The study on the 
relationship between sleep quality and academic performance of architecture students indicates a weak yet discernible 
correlation between their GPA and critical factors like sleep quality, number of units, schedule, and year level. The 
strength of these correlations indicates that there may be additional factors besides those examined in this study that 
significantly impact the students' academic performance. However, the links discovered are statistically significant. 
Two variables—year level and number of units—showed a substantial link with sleep quality when assessed for their 
correlation strength. However, sleep quality had a very weak correlation with academic performance.

1. Introduction
Sleep is an essential daily activity for humans since it is the part where people recover their energy after an exhausting 
day. Not having enough sleep can cause many health problems and diseases, which the right amount of sleep can 
prevent. Acquiring adequate and quality sleep on a regular basis can greatly enhance your brain function, mood, and 
overall health. Conversely, insufficient sleep can increase your chances of developing various diseases and disorders, 
such as heart disease, stroke, obesity, and dementia. Adopting a growth mindset can inspire you to come up with 
creative and innovative solutions. (Wein, 2021).  College students have a heavier academic workload as they pursue 
a specialized field based on their interests and skills. The heaviness of the academic workload mostly depends on the 
program that the students are studying, implying that other programs have much more workload than some programs. 
According to the National Survey of Student Engagement conducted by Indiana University, architecture students 
typically have the highest workload among all university degrees. The survey found that these students spend an

The Table 14 shows the correlation between the number of units and year levels as variables. As the Pearson 
correlation coefficient shows 0.034, the correlation between the two variables is weak.

The Table 15 shows that all variables have a weak correlation to Academic performance (GPA) except the PSQI which 
is the only one that was determined to have a significant impact on the Academic performance (GPA). For the Sleep 
quality correlation both the year level and number of units have a correlation coefficient with the sleep quality, 
however the PSQI is the only one with that was determined to have a significant impact. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study investigates the various factors that may impact the academic performance of architecture students. These 
factors include the quality of sleep, the number of units taken, the schedule, and the year level of the respondents. The 
proponents utilize Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess the degree of correlation between each variable. The 
correlation is determined based on the research model, which postulates the theoretical relationship between the 
variables. According to the research findings, all the respondents had poor sleep quality. The study on the academic 
performance of architecture students indicates a weak yet discernible correlation between their GPA and critical 
factors like sleep quality, number of units, schedule, and year level. While the observed relationships are statistically 
significant, the strength of these correlations suggests that there are factors beyond the ones investigated in this study 
that significantly affect the respondents' academic performance. Sleep quality had a very weak correlation to academic 
performance due to two variables - year level and number of units, which showed a significant association with sleep 
quality when tested for their correlation strength. 
 
The study also suggests a weak correlation exists between the year level of architecture students and both sleep quality 
and the number of academic units they undertake. The connection between year level and number of units shows the 
workloads that each participant reflected on their sleep quality, which resulted in the respondents' academic 
performance. The weak correlation between sleep quality and GPA suggests that, while getting enough sleep can 
improve academic achievement, it is not the only factor. Similarly, the small correlations with the number of academic 
units and scheduling preferences suggest that these variables only significantly impact predicting GPA among 
architecture students. While there is some association between year level and academic achievement, it underscores 
the complex nature of academic success, with several elements impacting performance throughout a student's 
architecture education.

Abstract 
The global shift towards sustainable transportation is centered around the growth of electric vehicles (EVs) primarily 
due to their zero tailpipe emissions. To facilitate the seamless transition from non-EVs to EVs and to alleviate the 
range anxiety experienced by EV users, substantial improvements in charging infrastructure is required. This involves 
the development of new fast charging stations and battery-swapping facilities. This research focuses on a step ahead 
and proposes an innovative solution by providing recharging and battery swapping services to EV users at their 
preferred time and location with mobile EV recharging and mobile battery swapping vans. The problem is formulated 
as a Multi-Depot Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) considering Hard Time Windows and Simultaneous 
Pickup and Delivery, using integer linear programming. The objective is to minimize the total cost of routing the 
recharging and battery swapping vans from charging stations to customer locations by satisfying the customer’s 
requirements effectively. The proposed mathematical formulation was tested on a small set of 8 customers and solved 
using Gurobi solver. Furthermore, this NP-hard problem is tackled by developing heuristics known as large 
neighborhood search aimed at scalability for larger instances of the problem. The heuristics was successfully 
implemented and tested for the same small set of 8 customers and a larger instance with two sets (100,200) customers 
and different depots generated randomly. Therefore, this study introduces an innovative approach to tackle challenges 
related to EV adoption thereby contributing to a more sustainable and accessible future for electric mobility.

1. Introduction
The future of mobility is shifting towards electric vehicles (Oh and Yun 2022) as they play a crucial role in addressing 
the concerns related to environmental sustainability and reducing the dependence on conventional fossil fuels. 
However, for the users to adopt an EV, developing a reliable and accessible charging infrastructure is essential (Paniyil 
et. al 2021). The current EV charging infrastructure faces several challenges, such as limited charging stations and 
longer charging duration at stations, resulting in range anxiety for potential EV users. Range anxiety is the concern 
experienced by EV users that the EV may not have enough battery capacity to reach its destination or the next charging 
station. Hence, a well-developed EV charging network is essential which will bring users the confidence to switch 
from non-EVs to EVs, contributing to a cleaner and greener future.  
This study introduces a more flexible and customer-centric approach by bringing battery swapping and recharging 
services directly to the customer's doorstep through the use of mobile battery swapping and recharging vans. This 
approach overcomes the challenges associated with traditional charging stations, where customers are required to 
travel to the station and wait for the vehicle to charge. In the method proposed by this paper, customers can request

5.2 Results and Discussion 
The multi-trip multi-depot capacitated vehicle routing problem with hard time windows and simultaneous pickup and 
delivery is solved using neighborhood search heuristics algorithm. The computations were done on the same laptop 
with the specifications mentioned previously.  
 
Six distinct instances were implemented, altering the number of depots (1, 3, 5) and varying the number of customers 
(100 and 200). The results revealed notable trends. As the number of depots increased while maintaining a constant 
number of customers, both the number of vehicles and routes exhibited an increase. Conversely, the total distance 
covered decreased with an augmented number of depots for a constant customer count. This outcome aligns with 
intuition, as a greater number of depots enables customers to be served from the nearest location, subsequently 
reducing the overall travel distance. Additionally, the average number of customers served per depot decreased as the 
number of depots increased, holding the total number of customers constant (Figure 3m Table 6).

6. Conclusion 
This research has provided insights and an effective solution to the challenges associated with multi trip muti depot 
capacitated vehicle routing problem with hard time windows and simultaneous pickup and delivery with the help of 
both exact model and neighborhood search heuristics algorithm. The exact model is limited to smaller instances due 
to the inherent NP-hard time complexity. On the other hand, the neighborhood search heuristics algorithm, designed 
to handle larger datasets, has showcased its efficiency in optimizing the routes and costs for a large number of 
customers. Apart from optimizing the costs, the heuristics algorithm is also made sure that is satisfied the constraints 
of the VRP. The iterative implementation of insert and swap scheme within the heuristics model has significantly 
improved the overall routing efficiency. Furthermore, the unique research contribution lies in the introduction of an 
on-site battery swapping and recharging solution through mobile units. This customer-centric approach addresses the 
limitations of traditional charging stations and enhances the overall appeal of electric vehicles to potential adopters. 
By effectively addressing the challenges in day-to-day mobility, we contribute to the advancement of eco-friendly

1. Introduction
Blockchain (BC) technology refers to an advanced database mechanism that is meant to facilitate the transparent flow 
of information within a business network. The technology helps in keeping records of transactions and sharing them 
with important stakeholders through the application. Companies use BC technology to streamline digital workflows, 
manage supply chains and improve distribution efficiencies. Offering benefits such as reduced operating costs, 
transparency, improved monitoring and oversight throughout the product lifecycle (Kumar et al., 2022) BC technology 
provides companies with sustainable strategies a smart contracts are used to implement applications outside of the 
negative environment This technology can be used. Ethical and environmentally friendly business ensures the 
sustainability of businesses by facilitating corporate social responsibility to maintain economic, ecological and social 
sustainability, which provide business activities increased longevity and resilience This project therefore seeks to 
define the role of blockchain technology in business sustainability. 
2. Literature Review
Agarwal (2023) explores the use of BC technology that enables sustainable improvement in HR performance, 
especially in the era of Industry 4.0. The study seeks to assess the utility of these technologies in enabling sustainable 
HR performance. In particular, Agarwal, (2023) explores the use of blockchain technology in recruitment, pay scale 
management, talent acquisition, and personnel record keeping. The study highlights that major HR challenges such as 
poor personnel management can be eliminated through the adoption of BC technology in human resource operations. 
Agarwal (2023) used secondary data from various websites to evaluate the impact of BC technology on HR activities. 
Agarwal (2023) found a positive correlation between blockchain technology application and improved HR operations. 
The study found that there was more streamlined efficiency in managing employees’ salaries and records in 
organizations that adopted BC technology in their HR practices.  
Shoker (2021) discusses the role of BC technology while enabling sustainable development. The study highlights the

impact of BC technology in enabling the shift towards sustainability in societies by investigating the rationale behind 
blockchain accounts, their main characteristics and how they function. The study also evaluates the main challenges 
pertinent in blockchain technology and existing gaps that require improvement for it to attain its full potential. 
According to Shoker (2021) blockchain technology has led to significant improvements through increased trust, 
decentralization, automation, resilience and immutability. The technology is a multidisciplinary enabler, since it brings 
together different operations of the firm. Shoker (2021) concludes that blockchain technology has facilitated the 
transition to a sustainable society, although there exist challenges that have hindered its full applicability to enable 
sustainable industries and societies.    
 
Kumar et al., (2022) studies the role of BC technology while promoting sustainability and green economies. The 
research highlights that application of blockchain technology facilitates sustainability by enabling transparency 
systems in the markets. The use of technology in manufacturing and supply chain management improves the efficiency 
of economic activities, leading to more sustainable production and supply of goods and services Kumar et al., 2013 . 
(2022) cite IBM and Deloitte as perfect examples of sustainability. Regarding the green economy, the study uses the 
Lablaco-Mitsui case study to illustrate the use of BC technology when promoting a green economy. Kumar et al., 
(2022) emphasize the importance of BC technology and its importance in achieving sustainability. The study confirms 
that blockchain technology enables sustainability by creating transparent businesses and improving their marketability. 
The study also highlights that BC technology moves organizations into a green economy by achieving benefits, 
reducing operating costs and focusing on a culture of sustainability. 
 
The study by Kumar et al., (2022) is backed by Khurshid et al., (2023) who investigate the relationship between 
circular economy and sustainable blockchain technology. The study also evaluates the role of the technology in 
information sharing and how it maximizes efficiency by providing fast, quick, accurate and timely data. Other benefits 
of blockchain technology include fighting fraud due to its encryption and sophisticated features meant to guarantee 
information security. According to Khurshid et al., (2023), the green economy main objectives is to restore, re-
manufacture, reclamation and reprocess. The study also assesses the contribution of blockchain technology in various 
industries. For instance, in the banking sector, the technology ensures there is safety in transactions especially in the 
current digital era.  
 
BC technology has enabled massive revolutionary shifts in the economy such as the health sector. This is because the 
BC technology compliments IoT, thus increasing efficiency in treatments and enabling flow of information in health 
organizations. Also, the technology has also reduced costs, irregularities, information discrepancies and mishandling 
of patients’ files. Khurshid et al., (2023) concludes that blockchain technology has increased transparency and 
decentralization, thus, minimizing fraud. Once combined with circular economy, the two paradigms have brought 
revolutionary changes in the global economy.  
 
3. Methodology  
This study relies on secondary data from peer-reviewed articles, academic journals and thesis publication. The 
secondary data will be collected through a comprehensive literature review of journals and articles that relate to BC 
technology and sustainability in industries. These articles will be outsourced from the most reputable electronic 
databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, JSTOOR and IEEE Explore. To ensure the data is reliable, the study will 
only consider peer-reviewed articles and journals. To ensure accuracy, the study will only use articles that discuss BC 
technology and its application in enabling sustainable industries. The journals and articles must have been published 
between 2010 and 2023 to ensure accurate records. The blockchain technology emerged in 2008 after the introduction 
of Bitcoin. Therefore, incorporating articles from 2010 provides a clear history since the time this technology took 
shape and got incorporated in sustainability objectives.  
 
Data from the selected journals and articles will be analysed through qualitative synthesis to evaluate the integral 
findings and themes of each study. Qualitative synthesis enables a researcher to identify the trends, themes, findings 
and conclusions of each research in order to infer them as the results of the study in question. In this case, the selected 
papers will be used to determine the role of BC technology in enabling sustainability in industries. The themes and 
findings of each study are used in the discussion section of this study to help identify the role of BC technologies and 
their impact on sustainable infrastructure. Data from the selected papers will be used to further support the research 
theme and present the findings and conclusions of this study.

4. Discussion  
Blockchain technology has tremendous potential to ensure sustainability in sectors as diverse as banking, healthcare, 
food and tourism. As technology provides security and encryption that enables secure, fast and agile transfer of 
information across multiple departments of the organization Khanfar et al., (2021) argues that one of the functions of 
BC technology is to facilitate productivity and supply chain operations have been simplified. Technology improves 
efficiency by providing tracking, transparency, security, and time sharing, thus enabling sustainable production 
Continuous improvement in manufacturing implies products that reduce carbon emissions and other environmental 
impacts and products that are safer for workers’ health Khanfar et al., (2021) concluded Blockchain technology 
improved manufacturing by centralization of information, secure sharing of data files and seamless automation that 
enabled the operation. In terms of sustainability, the study concludes that the technology enables use of systems that 
conserve energy, reduce negative environmental impact and also increase consumers’, communities’ and employees’ 
safety.  
 
Esmaielian (2020) discuss the future of blockchain and its contribution to efficient supply chain activities in industry 
4.0. The study identifies four major benefits of blockchain technology which are, enabling smart energy management 
through IoT, increasing the efficiency of delivery and transportation, facilitating smart money models by providing an 
avenue for monitoring and reporting performance and lastly, enhancing product visibility across its entire lifecycle. 
These findings align with Khanfar et al., (2021) who asserts that blockchain technology streamlines the manufacturing 
and supply chain activities of an organization. Besides its operational efficiency, blockchain technology contributes 
to social and environmental sustainability by enabling the implementation of circular economy which focuses on 
reprocess, recycling and re-manufacturing (Kumar et al, 2022). Therefore, blockchain technology facilitates 
sustainability through green logistics and transportation, IoT enabled energy management and smart business models 
such as social manufacturing and, sharing and circular economy.   
 
Ko et al., (2018) assert that blockchain technology has enabled real-time transparency in the manufacturing industry 
as well as cost savings. Blockchain technology enables real-time sharing of data and information since information is 
centralized and can be accessed by authorized recipients through an application. Centralized information sharing 
makes it easy for the data to be viewed by different departments such as sales and marketing, warehouse and 
distribution, making it easy to monitor a product throughout its entire lifecycle. When the technology is applied 
appropriately, it reduces the verification costs and also minimizes distortion of quality of goods since they are 
monitored throughout each step. This study is backed by Schinckus (2020) who asserts that block chain ensures supply 
chain transparency and waste management through real-time information sharing to avoid oversupply and 
understocking in the organizations. Therefore, blockchain technology guarantees sustainability by ensuring real-time 
tracking of supplies and products thus saving on manufacturing and supply chain costs.  
 
5. Conclusion  
Blockchain technology has a significant impact in industries including sustainability and improvement of circular 
economy. The technology enables real-time sharing of data, transparency and easier manufacturing, thus saving on 
costs and reducing wastage in manufacturing and supply chain. Different studies indicate that blockchain technology 
has brought huge benefits in diverse sectors across the globe especially in banking, health, agriculture and 
manufacturing. When complimented with IoT, the technology provides a major boost in the manufacturing sector by 
enabling automation, which saves on time and cost in the production process. In terms of sustainability, the blockchain 
technology facilitates green logistics and transportation, IoT enabled energy management and smart business models 
such as social manufacturing and circular economy.

Abstract 
This study evaluates the feasibility of autonomous shipping by employing a SWOT analysis, drawing insights from 
reviews of relevant literature from 2018 to the present. The field of autonomous shipping necessitates critically 
examining its potential, and this study seeks to contribute to this discourse. The study uses the SWOT analysis 
framework to assess this transformative technology's intrinsic strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. As 
discerned through our analysis, the strengths of autonomous shipping are manifold. They include the promise of 
heightened cost-efficiency and improved safety and security measures. These positive attributes stem from optimizing 
operational processes, streamlining crew requirements, and integrating advanced collision avoidance capabilities. 
However, the viability of autonomous shipping is contingent upon addressing several technological challenges. 
Notably, issues surrounding the development of robust automation systems, establishing reliable communication 
infrastructure, and formulating comprehensive navigation protocols emerge as prominent areas for improvement. 
Moreover, the analysis underscores the significance of overcoming substantial upfront costs to address financial 
feasibility and market adoption concerns. Despite these challenges, the study identifies compelling opportunities for 
autonomous shipping, driven by the escalating volumes of global trade and a growing acceptance of automation. The 
potential for further expansion is contingent upon regulatory alignments and the establishment of robust international 
protocols. Simultaneously, the study recognizes critical threats to adopting autonomous shipping, encompassing 
vulnerabilities to cyberattacks, piracy, societal anxieties about job displacement and ethical considerations. To 
contextualize and enrich these findings, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of pertinent literature published from 2018 
to the present, providing valuable insights into research trends and thematic focal points.

foundational component of maritime governance, is actively addressing social and ethical dimensions associated with 
autonomous ships. This endeavour reflects a conscientious examination of issues pertinent to seafarers' job safety and 
welfare within the context of emerging autonomous maritime technologies. 
 
C. Opportunities 
1. Increased trade accessibility and new business models 
The advent of autonomous shipping has instigated transformative shifts within existing business ecosystems, thereby 
facilitating the emergence of novel market opportunities. This technological paradigm has engendered the 
establishment of innovative business models, reshaping the landscape of the maritime industry. The application of 
autonomous technologies has expanded the boundaries of navigable waters and introduced the prospect of accessing 
hitherto uncharted territories (Tsvetkova & Hellström, 2022). 
 
An illustrative example of this transformative potential is the feasibility of navigating polar regions using autonomous 
ships. The utilization of autonomous technologies can render previously impassable waters accessible, thereby 
opening up unprecedented avenues for exploration and commercial activities in polar environments. This paradigm 
shift underscores the far-reaching implications of autonomous shipping on maritime business dynamics, delineating a 
trajectory toward unexplored markets and redefined operational frameworks. 
 
2. Diversification of shipping applications 
Autonomous shipping has expanded its applications within the maritime domain, notably demonstrated in projects 
such as the Polar Lander initiative, which involves the development of an autonomous surface vessel dedicated to 
scientific research in the Arctic. This project is oriented explicitly towards advancing oceanographic studies and 
seafloor mapping. The MASS in Ice Project, a research initiative, explores the complexities and potential of employing 
autonomous ships in polar environments (Schubert et al., 2018). These initiatives exemplify the diverse and 
specialized applications of autonomous shipping technologies in advancing scientific research and operational 
capabilities within the maritime sector. 
 
D. Threats 
1. Cyber-attacks and piracy concerns 
In autonomous shipping, the susceptibility to pirate attacks persists, contingent upon the level of autonomy 
implemented. The potential for pirate takeover remains a concern, notwithstanding the absence or reduction of on-
board crew. Additionally, autonomous ships confront a significant peril in cyber-attacks, wherein malicious actors may 
exploit vulnerabilities to commandeer vessels remotely, either for ransom demands or to inflict substantial damage. 
The imperative role of robust cyber security measures emerges as a critical component within autonomous shipping, 
underscoring the necessity for comprehensive safeguards against physical and virtual threats (Wang et al., 2023). 
 
2. Labour disruptions and social impact 
As per the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), the global maritime sector employs 2.1 million seafarers. 
This figure encompasses direct employees, with a consequential impact on millions of indirect employees who support 
this demographic. The transition towards autonomous shipping, characterized by diminished crew requirements, has 
the potential to induce apprehension within the job market (Issa et al., 2022). This prospect may precipitate social 
concerns related to job insecurity, thereby warranting careful consideration of the broader societal implications of 
implementing autonomous shipping technologies (Das & Arya, 2023). 
 
3. Unforeseen technical challenges 
The absence of large-scale, fully automated ships in contemporary operational contexts raises a pertinent inquiry 
regarding the potential consequences of an unforeseen technical issue. Despite the completion of simulation studies 
and experimental stages, the prospect of encountering an unexpected technical glitch while navigating the open sea 
remains a plausible concern (Ziajka-Poznańska& Montewka, 2021). This consideration underscores the need to 
comprehensively understand the potential risks and challenges of deploying fully automated maritime systems in real-
world scenarios. 
 
4. Conclusion  
The holistic exploration of autonomous shipping viability reveals a landscape brimming with transformative potential 
and intricate challenges. The overarching vision of autonomous shipping encompasses a paradigm shift toward cost-
efficient, operationally streamlined, and environmentally sustainable maritime practices. However, technological

immaturity, integration complexities, and a regulatory landscape in flux currently hinder this aspirational future. The 
broad opportunities presented include expanded trade horizons and innovative business models. However, these are 
juxtaposed against looming threats such as cyber-attacks, piracy, labour market disruptions, and unforeseen technical 
obstacles. Navigating this evolving frontier necessitates a concerted, collaborative effort from stakeholders to not only 
capitalize on the transformative strengths of autonomous shipping but also address and mitigate the multifaceted 
challenges, ensuring a future where autonomous technologies seamlessly integrate into the fabric of the maritime 
industry. 
 
In addition to the ongoing avenues of research delving into the technological aspects of autonomous shipping, a 
compelling need exists for concurrent exploration of critical dimensions that extend beyond the technical realm. 
Specifically, research endeavours should emphasize the development of robust regulatory frameworks to govern the 
integration of autonomous vessels into existing maritime infrastructures. Moreover, attention should be directed 
towards in-depth investigations into the social and ethical considerations surrounding the implementation of 
autonomous shipping technologies, acknowledging potential labour market disruptions and societal apprehensions 
related to job displacement. 
 
Furthermore, an essential but often overlooked aspect involves researching the protocols and procedures in post-
mortem situations, particularly vessel hijacking or under-attack scenarios. Understanding and formulating 
comprehensive strategies for handling these exigencies is imperative, encompassing the delineation of responsibilities, 
legal frameworks, and ethical considerations in the aftermath of such incidents. This facet of research becomes crucial 
not only for the safeguarding of valuable cargo but also for addressing potential threats to crew safety and the maritime 
environment. Thus, while technological innovation remains at the forefront, it is equally vital to broaden research 
horizons to encompass regulatory, social, and ethical dimensions and contingency planning for unforeseen events in 
the evolving landscape of autonomous shipping.

Abstract 
Rechargeable batteries have proven to be the most efficient energy storage solution for the intermittent renewable 
energy sources. Currently, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) is regarded as the leading energy storage system because of 
its power and energy density. Nevertheless, LIBs are facing issues such as the limited availability of lithium precursor 
materials and the cost attributed to this issue. Thus, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as a highly promising 
alternative to LIBs, but they are still under research. Battery research and especially battery material design is 
challenging because of the complex structure-property relationships, where different materials interact unpredictably 
and uncontrollably. Hence, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to accelerate the process of battery electrode 
material discovery. There are many parameters that determine whether the battery electrode material is suitable or not, 
such as the voltage and the specific capacity which both contribute to the overall energy density. Additionally, the 
volume change throughout the cycles contribute to the safety, efficiency and cyclability of the battery. Thus, several 
AI techniques such as decision trees, support vector machine, random forest and deep neural network (DNN) models 
have been used to predict the average voltage, maximum specific capacity, and volume change of the battery. The 
results showed that the DNN model performed best with an average mean absolute error of around 0.164. Based on 
the results obtained, machine learning has proven to be a crucial tool towards revolutionizing the battery material 
industry.

1. Introduction
There has never been a global health crisis like COVID-19. It is regarded as one of the major historical turning 
points, In the connection with such unhindered, established social and economic norms and ushering in a new 
era for humanity. The extent and velocity of the subsequent collapses in various activities are unheard of in our 
lifetimes (Gopinath 2020). According to Gopinath (2020), the crisis has resulted in numerous deaths, challenged 
the capabilities of healthcare systems, and placed the world in a state of emergency. The global economy is 
currently going through its worst recession since the Great Depression. It is impossible to predict the future 
because the social, economic, and health systems are about to collapse, but the choices that decision-makers 
make today will determine how the world turns out. In times of crisis, governments, communities, and 
organizations are looking to their leaders for direction. The problem is that our theories about how things work 
and what we believe to be true about how systems work are disintegrating, which could lead to specific purposes 
of leadership. The paper's main themes are centre around to examining the appropriate policies and tactics to use 
when choosing a good leader who can act with agility and flexibility when making decisions and quickly 
address new challenges and opportunities. Being honest in the way when any things are being perform, so that 
all parties; including, Risk management, Board management, stakeholders, fairness and ethical behaviours will 
continue to have faith in it. In addition, there must be some cooperative efforts among various Transparent 
Compliance etc. 
Identification of Research Gaps and Problems: 
In the beginning of the study, it was discovered that there were some Research Gaps that may allow us to 
investigate and discover some suitable strategies to fill some Gaps that may initially be referred to as

When leadership responsibilities are distributed and shared, a priceless sense of ownership would emerge. 
According to Kezar and Holcombe (2017), distributing leadership strengthens decision-making, produces 
motivated teams, and increases stakeholders' dedication to the organization's survival. One last leadership 
takeaway from our conversation is the importance of building organizational resilience. The ability to transition 
an organization from its pre-crisis state to one that is better afterward is what resilience is all about. It refers to 
navigating the crisis with sufficient dexterity to withstand hardship and enhance reaction to new obstacles. It 
also refers to using creativity and ingenuity to emerge from the crisis with fresh approaches to problem-solving. 
The concept of resilience recognizes that there isn't a single, universal strategy for overcoming organizational 
obstacles. Furthermore, it is predicated on the idea that not all crises are the same and that various circumstances 
call for various courses of action. Therefore, when making decisions and approaching operational thinking, 
leaders should always remember to adopt an agile and adaptable mindset. In order for an organization to survive 
a crisis, it must build the infrastructure required to support interactive decision-making, healthy communication, 
and strategic planning in an adaptable environment that is growth-oriented and agile (Raney 2014). 
Organizations can gain a deeper understanding of employees' fundamental concerns by incorporating flexibility 
into their culture. This will eventually enable them to respond to challenges that arise effectively and 
strategically (Caminiti 2020). 
 
While the majority of studies in HRD and leadership look at stable working environ- ments, the current 
pandemic and past crisis events show that decision making processes occur in unpredictable and unclear 
contexts. In this regard, we suggest HRD practi- tioners and scholars need to examine critical interventions that 
can be applied during unstable times and to identify the possible outcomes regarding the success and failure of 
applied interventions.

Abstract 
The efficient scheduling of midterm examinations at higher education institutions poses a multifaceted challenge. 
Multiple objectives must be optimized, such as minimizing the total number of students who have multiple exams on 
a single day or on consecutive days, minimizing the number of exams assigned to weekends, etc. The problem also 
includes many practical constraints belonging to different stakeholders. Some of these constraints are scheduling all 
exams on the allocated time period, scheduling single section courses to their lecture times, and scheduling all sections 
of multi-section courses at the same time in the evening or weekends. This study develops an algorithm and a Decision 
Support System (DSS) for this complex problem. Besides necessary structural constraints, this DSS incorporates real-
world complexities such as preferences for exam dates, fixing course dates, and variations in scheduling for single 
and multi-section courses. A construction heuristic empowered by a local search procedure is proposed, which is 
implemented using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The user-friendly interface facilitates both scheduling and 
sensitivity analysis, allowing educators to fine-tune parameters like the setting of the number of weeks allocated for 
midterms and penalties for unfavorable days and time slots. The system’s performance is evaluated using real data, 
demonstrating its potential to enhance educational management.

1. Introduction
The major problem in university midterm timetabling is to allocate the midterm exams to dates and timeslots without 
clashes and overloads. The problem involves many constraints stemming from the university, college, and department 
regulations, as well as the course requirements. Constraints can be divided according to their structure. Hard 
constraints are the set of conditions that cannot be violated and must be satisfied. As an example, a student cannot 
have more than one exam at the same time. Soft constraints are the set of conditions that are allowed to be breached 
but the target is to keep this to a minimum. They help define the objective function of the mathematical model under 
a multi-objective setting. For example, a student taking two exams on the same date is not desirable, but allowable. 
This can be converted to an objective function as minimizing the number of students taking two exams in consecutive 
time slots.  
In many universities, the timetabling process is decentralized; the midterm exam dates are decided by the course 
instructors. Sometimes, the course instructor decides on the dates by himself and announces it to the students. In some

As it can be seen in this table, even if the exam period is reduced to 2 weeks (12 working days), it is possible to have 
a timetable with no students having exams on consecutive slots. However, at the college level there will be 8 students 
who have exams on the same day in non-consecutive slots. The table clearly demonstrates the tradeoff between the 
number of exam days and the objective functions. Based on this, the college or the university administration can decide 
on the exam period. This demonstrates that the developed computerized algorithm is an effective tool to prepare 
timetables as well as perform sensitivity analysis. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, we considered the university midterm timetabling problem at the Department and College levels. We 
developed a mathematical programming formulation together with a heuristic algorithm. The algorithm is 
implemented in MS Excel VBA which handles the input data easily and provides the solutions in a few seconds. We 
performed case studies in our institution (at department and college levels) using Fall 2023 data. The results 
demonstrated that even for the larger problem that includes the whole college, the algorithm generates exam timetables 
efficiently. It also allows the decision makers to perform sensitivity analysis on problem parameters and obtain insights 
about the solution characteristics.  
 
As one future study, the algorithm can be modified to schedule final exams. Note that these two problems have several 
differences. There is no distinction of single and multi-section courses for the final exams. During the final exam 
periods there are no ongoing courses. The allocated exam slots are longer and the number of spanning exam days is 
less in the case of final exams. Assigning the exams to classrooms can also be included in the problem. Furthermore, 
developing a user-friendly graphical user interface and converting the algorithm into a decision support software 
would be beneficial. As another future study, an exam timetabling program could b e developed for the whole 
university, with various colleges, and various departments and programs inside each college.

Dual-Channel Closed-Loop Supply Chain: Competition and 
Channel Coordination 
Pinakhi Suvadarshini 
Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Management Amritsar, India 
Abstract 
Due to changing environmental laws, adoption of sustainable practices, and shortage of raw materials, manufacturers 
are increasingly focusing on remanufacturing. The implementation of successful remanufacturing practices is 
dependent on efficient recollection. Many firms are adopting dual-channel recollection to enhance their recollection 
efficiency. We study a dual-channel recollection efficiency of a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, 
a retailer, and a third-party collection agent, where the manufacturer recollects using any two of the three agents. We 
analyze three competitive hybrid recollection channels under full and asymmetric information settings using wholesale 
price, linear and non-linear two-part tariff contracts. Our key findings are as follows: (i) two part tariff (LTT) contracts 
can coordinate the recollection channel consisting of OEM and retailer irrespective of reverse channel competition, 
(ii) recollection using OEM and retailer works better when OEM offers wholesale price contract, (iii) if OEM offers
LTT contract, then recollection channel consisting of OEM and retailer performs better with low competition intensity, 
and recollection channel consisting of OEM and a third-party (3P) vendor performs better with high competition
intensity, (iv) an OEM cannot design channel coordination mechanism whenever a 3P vendor is involved but she can
design Pareto-optimal contracts to improve profitability, (v) in asymmetric information game, an OEM’s profit
increases if recollection agents share their hidden cost information with her, and (vi) OEM earns more profit by
employing herself and another supply chain agent for product recollection if OEM’s recollection efficiency is higher;
in case of complete outsourcing of recollection activity through a retailer and a 3P vendor, OEM earns more profit if
the retailer is more efficient than the vendor.

Abstract 
Range anxiety continues to be one of the most important factors negatively affecting the transition to electric vehicles 
(EVs). However, range anxiety can be reduced if the EV driver knows where to stop for charging on the route 
according to the range information remaining at the beginning of the journey. Although EVs can access real-time data, 
it cannot be expected that the created charging plan will reduce range anxiety unless range prediction is made 
considering the conditions of the determined route. The aim of this study is to determine where and how much the EV 
should be charged for minimum travel time or cost by creating a charging plan based on real-time range prediction for 
a specified route. The deep neural network model was trained by using the inputs of the static features and dynamic 
features of the journey in the range prediction model. The amount of energy consumed between the nodes is obtained 
by the range prediction model. Within the scope of charging planning, a mixed integer programming model is 
developed that consider nonlinear charging times, dynamic charging prices, vehicle to the grid, multiple charger with 
different power levels and their availability. Since the developed mathematical programming model was insufficient 
in terms of the solution time, a matheuristic is proposed. Test results on 32 various problems indicate that the 
matheuristic approach outperforms the metaheuristic and heuristics for both minimum travel time and cost.

Abstract 
Considering the long charging times, limited range of electric vehicles (EVs), and the limited number of charging 
stations, it is vital to check the feasibility of a route and make a charging plan, especially for long journeys. Charge 
planning of an EV includes the decisions of where, when, and how much the EV needs to be charged. Charging 
planning is one of the areas where decision support should be provided to EV drivers. Thanks to intelligent 
transportation system (ITS) technologies, it is now possible to receive information from charging stations, which plays 
an essential role in providing decision support to EV drivers. This study proposes an optimization model to find an 
optimal charge planning model for suitable routes that enables the EV to complete its journey without range anxiety. 
The proposed model determines where and how much charge is needed at the charging stations considering time-of-
use (TOU) pricing. An integer linear programming model is developed based on the range coverage location model 
(RCLM), which determines the minimum number of charging stations the EV needs to visit. The proposed 
optimization model is tested on randomly generated problems. The test results show that the model can find the optimal 
charging plan in a reasonable time.

Abstract 
Emirati women face challenges in the industrial sector in UAE, specifically the existence of glass ceiling barriers. The 
United Arab Emirates (UAE) is steadfastly addressing the challenges faced by Emirati women, aligning with the 
United Nations' fifth Sustainable Development Goal and the International Labor Organization's commitment to gender 
equality. This is accomplished through a cooperative strategy involving the government, private sector, and local 
organizations. This study aims to investigate the strategies that can be implemented to overcome these barriers, and 
the role of the UAE government in supporting women's professional development and promoting gender equality in 
this sector.  The primary objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to the glass 
ceiling and assess the UAE government's role in supporting women's professional development 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In the industrial sector, women face a complex challenge marked by gender discrimination that obstructs their path to 
leadership roles, reinforcing the ""glass ceiling."" Work-Life Balance and limited career growth opportunities further 
compound these difficulties. Overcoming these obstacles requires a dual approach: organizations must implement 
support programs and gender-sensitive assessments to foster diversity and equal opportunities, while women 
themselves can pursue higher education, showcase their competence, boost self-confidence, and actively seek 
leadership roles. This combination of efforts is crucial in creating a more inclusive professional landscape and 
facilitating women's advancement to leadership positions in these sectors. 
The UAE government, with entities like the Gender Balance Council, has introduced initiatives such as the ""Gender 
Balance Guide"" to advance gender equality and women's leadership across various sectors. This collaborative 
approach plays a pivotal role in establishing an inclusive environment with equal opportunities for Emirati women in 
the private sector, contributing to the UAE's advancement in this regard.        
1.1 Objectives 
This study focuses on understanding how the government efforts are helping in addressing these challenges. 
2. Literature Review
The UAE Labor Law firmly outlaws gender and any form of discrimination, ensuring fair treatment and equal 
opportunities for women. Companies are urged to comply with these regulations, fostering an inclusive work

industrial sector. This dynamic interplay of governmental initiatives, awareness campaigns, and collaboration sets the 
stage for the advancement of gender equality and the shattering of the glass ceiling in the Industrial sector. 
6. Conclusion
In summary, this research sheds light on the challenges faced by Emirati women in the UAE's industrial sector, 
particularly the hurdles known as the ""glass ceiling"" that block them from reaching top positions. The United Arab 
Emirates is actively working to overcome these challenges, following international goals for gender equality. The 
government, alongside businesses and local groups, is working together on plans to support women in their 
professional growth and break through the barriers that limit their progress. The study emphasizes that while the 
government has introduced various initiatives, opinions about how effective they are can differ, showing that there's 
still work to be done to ensure fairness and equality for women in the industrial field. 
In the future, the UAE government aims to improve on its current strategies and work closely with different groups to 
make the industrial workplace more inclusive and more fair for women. By continuing these efforts, the UAE is 
moving towards a future where gender equality is more than just a goal on paper, and women have equal opportunities 
to advance in the industrial sector, breaking through the barriers that have held them back.

Abstract 
This paper seeks to construct a theoretical framework to understand better crowdfunding, its applications, and its 
impact on the progression of start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Researchers have 
investigated the origins and consequences of financing through crowdfunding in start-ups and SMEs thus far. 
Lack of funding to launch, maintain, and expand firms is one of the most significant obstacles to small and 
medium enterprises' success. Higher rules and prudential standards by financial institutions, combined with the 
global financial crisis of 2007–2008, significantly reduced credit supply to start-ups and SMEs. Crowdfunding 
is a group effort that enables business owners to obtain cash from numerous individual sources via online 
platforms. This article explores the growth of crowdfunding within the Indian context, consolidating various 
scholarly studies focusing on advancements in funding for start-ups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). 
Furthermore, it delves into how much crowdfunding has provided financial assistance to these entities. The 
article aims to highlight to researchers and policymakers the necessity of enhancing the structure to achieve 
balanced development between conventional and alternative economic systems.

Introduction
Recent years have seen a dramatic shift in how early-stage firms are financed due to two factors. First was the 
crisis of 2008 that destroyed confidence in investment operations managed and run by sizable financial 
institutions (banks, insurance firms, and trust organizations) that were situated in or related to major financial 
hubs. Another one is a proliferation of bottom-up initiatives powered by innovative, multifunctional, and multi-
sided platforms built on new models of digital economic circulation, which was made possible by the internet's 
rapid development of technology (Salomon, 2018). These two trends catalyzed crowdfunding platforms' global 
expansion, bringing together entrepreneurs, investors, and established financial intermediaries. Similarly, SMEs 
could not raise funds to finance and support their projects. SMEs and start-ups suffer from the smallness and 
newness because of asymmetrical information and have difficulty getting outside funding (Giudici & Rossi-
Lamastra, 2018). It provides financing services, helps to test the market, and gives the entrepreneurs feedback.

The Companies Act of 2013 and the Securities Act, which includes the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act of 
1956 and the Depositories Act of 1996, are the current laws that apply to corporations raising capital (Sarda & 
Goel, 2014). 
 
If the securities' post-issue face value 2 is more significant than 10 crore rupees, SMEs must list them on the 
SME platform. SEBI has created the ""SMEs category"" to give them more possibilities. (Sarda & Goel, 2014), It 
offers SMEs a few funding options but nothing to start-ups because they require less capital to launch their 
businesses.

Equity- and debt-based crowdfunding are included in security-based crowdfunding, which is regarded as a type 
that generates financial returns (Ashta, 2018). According to the consultation paper, SEBI has expressed interest 
in implementing equity and debt-based crowdfunding in India (Verma et al., 2016). Due to SEBI's lack of 
interest in crowdfunding, under current law, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (the ""SEBI 
Act"") and the Companies Act 2013, the provisions of two statutes, namely the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India Act, 1992 (the ""SEBI Act""), will govern crowdfunding projects. 
 
The proposed Indian Framework restricts participation in crowdfunding to confident certified investors only: 
a) Qualified Institutional Buyers 
b) Companies incorporated under the Indian Companies Act with a net minimum value of Rs. 200 million  
c)  High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) who have a minimum net worth of Rs. 20 million 
d) Qualified Retail Investors who seek investment advice or are qualified for investment advice or avail 
themselves of the services of a portfolio manager. 
SEBI has proposed that the entities that fall under any of the following classes shall be authorized to set up a 
crowdfunding platform: Security-based crowdfunding is viewed as a type of financial ""Draft Indian 
Framework."" 
a) Registered depositories with SEBI status and recognized stock exchanges with terminal presence 
across the country 
b) The Central or State Government supports Class Technology Business Incubators and, among other 
things, has a minimum net value of Rs. 100 million and at least a few years of experience (Ashta, 
2018). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Innovation in financing to sectors, notably start-ups SMEs, is acceptable when traditional financial sources fail 
to accommodate the credit demands of start-ups & SMEs and entrepreneurial chances continue to emerge. 
Crowdfunding was developed to level the playing field and provide individual investors the chance to aggregate 
relatively small sums of money to meet the funding needs of start-ups or growing enterprises. India continued to 
lag behind its international competitors and contributed very little of the funds generated. It happens due to the 
legal framework governing equity crowdfunding is still unclear. Crowdfunding was made more restrictive by 
SEBI's strict regulations by placing it under the Companies Act 2013, which has harmed the industry. Despite 
SEBI's announcement in March 2017 that it was open to revisiting the sector's regulatory standards, it is unlikely 
that any expansion will materialize in the upcoming years.

As demonstrated in the USA JOBS Act 2012, the SEBI regulations should be more lenient to allow anyone to 
invest in crowdfunding. Additional investor protections, such as secondary market options and online platform 
regulation, should be included. However, the consultation document provides a small window of opportunity for 
the sector's expansion. The government should legalize the platforms so that investors can legally invest in their 
platforms. Crowdfunding is one of the best alternative avenues for financing start-ups and SMEs for their 
growth. 
 
Several limitations in our findings provide opportunities for additional study. This study mainly focuses on the 
equity-based platform only. Researchers can also study peer-to-peer lending platforms and their impact on 
economic development. Moreover, it is limited to only India. We have included information on equity platforms 
and the projects connected to them. Further studies can be done on analyzing factors that lead to the success of 
equity-based platforms or the associated projects. 
 
7. Implications 
A ""financing escalator,"" crowdfunding strengthens start-ups and SMEs, improves sources of capital, and makes 
it easier for some segments to access financing. Through online platforms, crowdfunding enables business 
owners to obtain capital from various private sources. This study adds new knowledge about the dynamics 
influencing the success of companies funded by equity crowdfunding. This study is the one that focuses on 
equity-based platforms in India. It helps entrepreneurs know the alternate sources of finance and information 
regarding the equity platform available in India. Investors also came to know the investment opportunities. It 
gives an overview of the rules and regulations related to investors' safety and investment.

Abstract 
Friction stir processing has paved the way for the fabrication of surface composite in solid-state processing routes 
wherein desired properties are tailored up to a specified thickness. In the present investigation, surface composite is 
fabricated on AA5083 alloy using hybrid reinforcements (SiC-Fe-Mn-Sn) and the characteristics of the produced 
surface composites were explored using thermal analysis and mechanical tests such as micro-hardness and tensile 
analysis. To observe the distribution of reinforcement across the processed zone, a detailed microstructural 
examination was carried out. All these characteristics were assessed across all 18 samples but in the present 
investigation, one of the best results is discussed. Optical micrographs elegantly portray an array of meticulously 
processed zones, encompassing stir zone, the thermomechanically affected zone, heat-affected zone, and base 
material. Within these intricate zones, the grain size gracefully transitions from one distinct zone to another. 
Microhardness and tensile strength experienced a notable augmentation attributable to the refinement of grains and 
the fortifying influence of the Orowan mechanism while thermal behavior explained the temperature evolution during 
the process.

1. Introduction
Aluminum alloys are widely used materials in various industries owing to their virtuous properties like high specific 
strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and ease with design (Dwivedi et al. 2021; Sharma et al. 2015) while they also 
possess poor wear properties. Hence, creating a metal matrix composite based on aluminum proves to be a superior 
choice to instill all the desired properties. Moreover, these metal matrix composites (MMCs) can be manufactured 
using methods involving both liquid and solid-state processing routes. Challenges related to liquid processing methods 
include the creation of harmful phases and undesired reactions between the reinforcement and matrix phases at elevated 
temperatures. To address this concern, a solid-state processing method known as friction stir process (FSP) is 
recommended for the production of surface composites (SC). SC’s are gaining popularity through FSP since it has a

3.4 Tensile Strength 
It is worthwhile to mention that hardness and strength are closely related to each other therefore, reasons of increment 
in hardness and strength are similar. Figure 5 depicts the comparison of UTS in BM and FSPed sample. In FSPed 
sample, strengthening occurs due to various mechanisms such as grain size strengthening through Hall Petch effect, 
solid solution strengthening and strain hardening. Further, as the composite is a mixture of two or more immiscible 
phases depending on the composition of reinforcement. The rule of mixture-based strengthening is a factor in case of 
composites (Dwivedi et al.2023) (Figure 5).

5. Conclusion 
Surface composite Al5083/ (Sic-Fe-Mn-Sn) was fabricated through FSP using the given process parameters. Detailed 
macro and microstructural study, micro-hardness measurement, thermal analysis and tensile testing were investigated. 
Notable conclusions are mentioned below: 
 
• 
Fine and recrystallized grains are found in SZ due to dynamic recrystallization process. Grain structures are 
varying from SZ to BM.  
• 
Increase in hardness is achieved due to two mechanisms namely by grain refinement in stir zone and by 
orowan strengthening. 
• 
Maximum temperature was recorded during processing was 419֠Ϲ in AS as flow and deformation starts from 
this side which generated lots of heat. Tensile strength of the FSPed sample was increased from base material 
because of grain refinement and adding of reinforcement particles.

Abstract
 
This paper employs combination of SWOT analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in strategic planning 
for tourism of Asir, which is located in the south region of Saudi Arabia. The objective of the research is to identify 
and rank the various options for the growth of the tourism sector in the Asser region. The SWOT analysis will be 
utilized in the construction of strategies, as well as the AHP method will be used to rank the various candidate 
strategies. In order to collect and analyze study data from forty different specialists, a questionnaire and a 
technique will be used. In the business region, both the effectiveness of internal factors and the effectiveness of 
external variables will be evaluated. On the basis of the matrix that the SWOT model uses to compare internal 
and external factors, it was determined that an aggressive strategy would be the most effective approach. In the 
second model, we employed a combined SWOT-AHP model with a list of criteria and together with sub-criteria 
to identify the optimal approach. Offensive methods were given the most emphasis in this model. As a result, the 
tourism potential in this region should be given special consideration, and it should be placed on the agenda of 
managers and planners in order to improve the economic standing of the region, as well as to create employment 
prospects.

enabling vital signs monitoring and measurement in both home and hospital care settings. However, their development 
necessitates considerations of longevity, durability, repairability, and environmentally-friendly disposal, aligning with 
circular economy principles and sustainability goals. This research conducts a comprehensive literature review, 
analyzing the interconnection between the circular economy, smart textiles, and digital transformation. The review 
synthesizes relevant literature to identify key findings and insights, highlighting the current state of research in this 
interdisciplinary domain. Moreover, the paper assesses the implications and potential impacts that arise when 
combining these three domains into a unified framework. By exploring the interplay between smart textiles, circular 
economy principles, and digital transformation, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how these domains 
can be effectively integrated to drive innovation in the healthcare sector.

1. Introduction and Motivation
Digital transformation in healthcare is currently the subject of much research, but also of European strategies and 
policies. The process of digital transformation encompasses a wide range of areas, technologies and processes that are 
related to the delivery of care. The aim is to ensure the efficiency, accessibility and safety of the entire healthcare 
system. In this paper, we look in more detail at technologies that enable the acquisition of patient data using sensors 
that are part of so-called smart garments. And it is important to recognize the importance of this data in the whole 
process of digitalization.  
The new field of smart textiles is getting more and more attention, given the technological advances that have been 
quite visible in recent years. The smart textiles market is estimated to be valued at 2.3 billion in 2021. It is estimated 
that around 2026 this market will reach a value of 6.6 billion due to the significant growth that has occurred in recent 
years (Collective 2022). By smart textiles, we can think of value-added textiles, which can be added functionality in 
the form of electronic components that can add another level of healthcare delivery, for example, in the healthcare 
sector. In the case of smart textiles, the focus should be on how they are produced and the materials used to ensure 
reusability and avoid unnecessary waste. This opens up a lot of scope for manufacturing with high-quality and durable 
materials (Mečņika and Dipl 2014). The circular economy is currently a highly debated topic. This is the name for a

Abstract 
This paper explores the paradigm of continuous improvement in construction cost management, emphasizing the 
utilization of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) as a pivotal factor in driving this advancement. 
Embracing the lean construction principle and the plan-do-check-act approach, the study emphasizes the need for 
requirements and techniques in cost management. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is recognized as crucial for 
budgeting construction costs, but it faces challenges related to automation and technology. In this study we explore 
the use of Generative AI in generating Bills of Quantities (BOQs) for building cost management in small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs). The exploration combines transformer-based techniques and Large Language Models 
(LLM), introducing a novel approach to development of BOQs in construction projects. Robustly Optimized BERT 
Pre-training approach (RoBERTa), an effective and reliable transformer architecture, categorizes substructure and 
superstructure components with an impressive 91% accuracy, forming a solid foundation. Fuzzy similarity matching 
connects sub-element records to project cost tables, incorporating cost data for meticulous computations. Leveraging 
the advanced text-generation capabilities of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art language model, the study automates the 
construction of a detailed and comprehensive BOQ. This departure from traditional rule based BOQ development 
offers enhanced flexibility and contextual knowledge. This approach, combining transformer-based models for precise 
categorization with LLM (GPT-4) for automated BOQ generation, presents a simplified and efficient solution for cost 
budgeting in building projects. This innovative method not only promises improved project documentation but also 
signifies potential revolutionary progress in building cost-management procedures. The findings provide valuable 
insights for construction professionals, paving the way for a more efficient and advanced approach to cost management 
in the construction industry.

5. Conclusion  
Generative AI can create a level playing field for all experience levels of construction costing professionals, business 
scales, and project types by simplifying the approach to construction project measurement and costing. SMEs and 
large construction companies have unused big data, essential in producing large language models that would serve the 
Generative AI for the cost. SMEs would benefit from a low-cost, easier, and quicker approach to quantifying and 
costing construction costs through Generative AI. To ensure the ongoing success, acceptance, and practical 
implementation of cost-related projects, it is important to continuously improve productivity across the whole project 
lifecycle. Generative AI will enable quantity surveyors, cost estimators, construction managers, and contractors to 
gradually enhance project cost efficiency. This research contributes to exploring the dynamic opportunities and 
challenges associated with integrating Generative AI into the construction industry. The process of using Generative 
AI for BOQ productions creates more time for more productive cost planning and management tasks, thereby adding 
value to the role of the quantity surveyor and cost planning teams. This innovative method not only streamlines the 
automatic generation of BOQ but also serves as a fundamental component for precise cost estimation and management 
in construction projects. It signifies a positive trajectory for future enhancements. The feasibility study decisively 
demonstrates the practicality of employing AI for BOQ and the comprehensive administration of building expenses. 
The findings from our proposed framework underscore the immense potential inherent in deploying such technologies, 
highlighting their effectiveness in reshaping established procedures within the construction industry. The findings of 
this research can direct the construction research community to focus on the practical applications of Generative AI 
capabilities. Moreover, this study provides an initial groundwork for realizing the capacity and challenges of 
Generative AI in this industry. Further validation studies implementing the proposed framework and developing real 
construction applications would be a natural extension of this research.

Abstract 
This paper aims at planning a piece of land with an area of 5,000 square meters located in the city of Taif, specifically 
in Al-Shifa. It was divided into three levels, each level 3.5 square meters away from the other. The project was divided 
into three main buildings: the first was a villa, the second was workers’ housing, and the third was a stable and a track. 
For horses, among the secondary things that the project contains are, firstly, the swimming pool, secondly, a small 
sports club, and thirdly, a tennis court. The second project is about four apartments in an area of 700 square meters. 
The apartments contain an outdoor garden and parking lots. Each apartment has a parking space. The land has two 
different designs, each has a unique idea. It is an architectural design for a private residential building for two parents 
and two sons with their families. It is located in the city of Taif, in the Al-Shifa region, on an area of 5000 square 
meters The land was divided into a two-story villa, three apartments for workers, and a garden consisting of a tennis 
court and horse stables. The project will face obstacles, including the diversity of land levels, the preservation of local 
cultures, their social behaviors, and the modern character of the original architecture in designing their home with 
sustainable and smart home principles. 
The Summer House project was inspired by 4 projects, so we came up with a good idea, so that I took from each 
project the distinctive thing in it that suits the environment of the project that I am currently working on, and which 
makes the project present better, more beautiful, and more comfortably, and also protects privacy. we made the 
summer House project allow the residents of the house to experience... Best for vacation

Abstract 
Technological advancements in Machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and data science are bringing industries 
to the era of the fourth industrial revolution. The application of machine learning in chemical engineering is in the 
domains of process modeling, optimization, and predictive analysis. Traditional process modeling relies heavily on 
first-principal methods, which, while accurate, are computationally demanding and are non-flexible for variable 
process conditions. Green methanol produced through the power-to-liquid (PtL) process has gained significant 
popularity due to its various applications in household items, as a raw material for manufacturing valuable chemicals, 
and as a fuel both in blend or pure form. In today's competitive and uncertain chemical industry market, fast and 
accurate models are required to predict the plant output. This work aims to develop a surrogate model of the methanol 
production process based on the data-driven technique and using machine learning to predict energy requirements, 
final product purity, and methanol production rate. The effect of the sampling size and sampling technique (mainly 
Latin-Hypercube Sampling - LHS, Monte Carlo, and SOBOL) on the performance of the surrogate model is evaluated. 
A comparative analysis of different machine learning (e.g., XG-Boost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector 
Regression) and Deep learning models (e.g., Artificial Neural Networks) is conducted using metrics such as coefficient 
of determination (R²), mean-squared error (MSE), and mean-absolute-error (MAE). Additionally, this work explores 
the use of these trained machine learning models in optimizing process conditions to maximize production rate, 
enhance product purity, and reduce energy requirements.

Abstract 
Hydrogen Sulphide Methane Reformation (HSMR) is a viable alternative for simultaneous H2S valorization and 
hydrogen production, offering a carbon-neutral alternative. Concurrently, the industrial revolution, driven by emerging 
technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence is reshaping chemical  industry as well. machine learning 
offers robust models for accurate process forecasting, overcoming computational demands and inflexibility. This work 
focuses on developing a surrogate model for the HSMR process, a promising, waste to energy, route for sustainable 
hydrogen production. Integrating machine learning with design of experiment techniques, the study systematically 
generates data using Aspen plus v11 simulation and employs established adaptive space filling sampling techniques. 
Models such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression, Extreme Gradient 
Boosting, and Artificial Neural Networks was trained on the refined data set, an accuracy of up to 97% in predicting 
the process outputs was achieved.  Furthermore, this research extends to the optimization of an artificial neural network 
(ANN) surrogate model using evolutionary algorithms, specifically genetic algorithms and differential evolution. 
within the Python environment, this optimization aims to identify optimal process conditions for HSMR. A 
comparative analysis with the base case provides insights into the effectiveness of these evolutionary algorithms in 
enhancing the performance of the ANN model. This work contributes to enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness 
of HSMR, bridging the gap between machine learning capabilities and sustainable energy solutions.

Abstract 
This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools, 
including Online Meeting Platforms (e.g., Zoom), Learning Management Systems (LMS), and Classroom Support 
Platforms (CSP), in the context of global engineering courses. This study comprises three distinct phases with the goal 
of informing the design of effective courses. These phases involve ICT within diverse learning approaches and the 
implementation of active learning methods tailored to students' aptitudes. The first phase involves a comparative 
analysis of Active Learning (AL) in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course, examining the differences between 
traditional face-to-face instruction and online delivery. The second phase centers on a Basic English course, exploring 
variations in instructional methods. Specifically, one class is instructed by a teacher less accustomed to using ICT, 
while the other benefits from a well-organized approach integrating various ICT tools. The third phase of this study 
focuses on the integration of new ICT, particularly the Metaverse, into ESP courses. A pilot test was conducted, 
offering a trial run of the Metaverse English course to voluntary students for a brief period. The results of this pilot 
test included unexpected outcomes, underscoring the importance of conducting trials before implementing new 
instructional methods in a formal classroom setting. In each stage, both qualitative and quantitative data were 
presented, and the outcomes of the given data emphasizing the unparalleled significance of ICT in enhancing the

Introduction
Companies in the modern era encounter fierce competition that arises from both online platforms and the physical 
realm (Moagar-Poladian et al. 2017). The value that customers derive from businesses is no longer predominantly 
based on the actual products offered, but rather on the services provided (Zomerdijk and Voss, 2010). Consequently, 
the customer experience has emerged as the key factor in distinguishing companies from one another and has become 
a top priority for management (Heid et al. 2018). Creating a superior customer experience has become a holy grail for 
many businesses, particularly in the retail sector the landscape has been transforming at an unprecedented speed and 
scale, largely driven by omni-channel development, digitalization and retail innovation (Verhoef et al., 2016). 
Customer Journey Mapping (CJ) is a method that involves creating visual representations of the customer's decision-
making process, considering their perspective. This technique helps in gaining a deeper understanding of the customer 
experience and is referred to as a CJ Map (Wassen et al. 2023). CJ Mapping is beneficial for fostering innovation as 
it provides a basis for developing new or enhanced services.  Innovations are difficult to define, but they can be related 
to streamlining the service, helping the customer, differentiating the service, or contributing to the experience (Martin, 
1729","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

By embracing these innovative strategies, the courier service company can overcome operational challenges, 
improve service quality, and enhance its competitive position in the market. 
 
5. Conclusion  
In today's fast-paced and digital world, businesses' audiences live in a world where next-day and in some places, same-
day delivery is rapidly becoming the norm. Creating an excellent delivery experience for customers is not only about 
meeting these evolving expectations, but also about building trust and increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases. 
The delivery parcel logistics industry places significant importance on innovation. With the rapid advancements in 
technology, it is essential for companies to embrace innovation in order to remain competitive and meet the changing 
needs of customers. By utilizing innovative solutions such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IoT, 
logistics companies can streamline their operations, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall customer experience. 
For example, the implementation of drone delivery systems can facilitate faster and more accurate deliveries, 
particularly in remote areas. Additionally, the integration of real-time tracking, data analytics, and predictive modeling 
can empower logistics providers to optimize routes, reduce delivery times, and proactively address potential 
disruptions. Ultimately, innovation in delivery parcel logistics allows companies to stay ahead of the competition and 
deliver exceptional services to their customers. 
 
An effective way to drive innovation is through the identification of customer experiences and the creation of a 
customer journey map. In this paper, an initial study was conducted for a case study that requires further research to 
assess validity and examine the output. In this case study, an attempt was made to model the customer journey for 
parcel delivery and based on that, a roadmap for innovation was outlined. In the end, recommendations were made for 
problem-solving and innovation, which require further implementation and examination of the original results from 
the recommendations. In the case of a courier service company, this map outlines the process of customer and parcel 
journey, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of customer expectations, needs, goals, and pain points. By 
identifying these key elements, organizations can uncover challenges and create a roadmap for innovation within the 
company. This roadmap serves as a foundation for proposing solutions that address these challenges, employing both 
reactive and proactive innovation strategies. The results show that the customer journey map and the identification of 
customer needs provide valuable insights for parcel delivery companies to enhance the customer experience. Strategies 
such as transparency, flexibility, personalization, and efficient communication can significantly improve customer 
satisfaction and foster brand loyalty. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including 
operational capacity, data integration, systemic and process-related issues, lack of supervision and follow-up, optimal 
routing and allocation, performance shortcomings and limited services diversity. Addressing these challenges is 
crucial for driving innovation, improving operational efficiency, and positioning the company as customer-centric. By 
proactively and reactively tackling these challenges, companies can foster a culture of innovation, continuously 
improve their services, and meet the evolving needs of customers in the courier service industry. Moreover, this 
research suggests to the establishment of a dynamic and continuously updated customer journey map, which serves 
as a valuable input for generating innovative solutions, fostering creativity, and encouraging brainstorming within the 
organizational culture.

Abstract 
The circular economy promotes a closed-loop system where resources are used for as long as possible and challenges 
the conventional linear model of ""take-make-dispose."" In the manufacturing industry, this entails creating products 
and procedures that can be recycled, repaired, or reused to reduce the use of virgin materials and environmental impact. 
However, understanding the implementation barriers is crucial before investing in a strategic approach for adoption. 
This study analyzed challenges using the index of the Item Objective Congruence (IOC) technique and expert 
opinions. The findings identified seven significant challenges: Lack of Awareness and Education, Modifications in 
Consumer Behavior, Infrastructure Limitations, Lack of Skills and Technical Challenges, Lack of Government 
Support, Environmental Impact, and Lack of Guidelines and Standards, which play significant roles in the successful 
implementation of circular economy practices in the manufacturing industry. These findings provide valuable 
guidance for the strategic implementation of circular economy principles in manufacturing and practical insights and 
recommendations to businesses, policymakers, and stakeholders on effectively embracing circular economy principles 
in the manufacturing industry.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry plays a critical role in global economic growth and development (Peter & Mbohwa, 2019). 
However, its current linear model of production and consumption, known as the ""take-make-dispose"" approach, has 
led to resource depletion and environmental degradation (Bjørnbet et al., 2021). This model relies heavily on extracting 
finite resources, resulting in significant waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions (Ulian et al., 2020). To address 
these issues, the circular economy concept has gained prominence, offering a paradigm shift towards a closed-loop 
system that maximizes resource efficiency and minimizes waste (Bjørnbet et al., 2021). The circular economy is a 
regenerative approach that challenges the linear model by emphasizing value retention in products, materials, and 
resources for as long as possible (Bjørnbet et al., 2021). It advocates for transforming the manufacturing industry into 
a system that operates in cycles, where waste is minimized and resources are continuously reused, recycled, or 
remanufactured (Koszewska, 2018). By transitioning to a circular model, the manufacturing sector can reduce its 
reliance on virgin materials and mitigate environmental impacts associated with waste generation, such as pollution 
and carbon emissions (Badhotiya et al., 2022; Sousa-Zomer et al., 2018). 
This study explores the principles and advantages of the circular economy within the manufacturing context by 
analyzing recent developments and trends in the literature. This study delves into case studies of manufacturing 
businesses that have successfully applied circular economy principles and assessed the positive effects on their 
financial performance and the environment. Furthermore, through expert interviews, this study identifies the 
challenges and potential barriers to implementing circular economy principles in manufacturing. Our objective is to

Finally, continuous monitoring, measurement, and improvement are vital for successful implementation. 
Manufacturers should establish metrics and indicators to measure resource efficiency, waste reduction, and the 
environmental impacts of circular practices.  
 
5. Conclusions 
In conclusion, this research underscores the importance of adopting circular economy principles in manufacturing to 
enhance resource efficiency and minimize waste. A comprehensive understanding of the challenges specific to the 
manufacturing sector was obtained by reviewing relevant literature and conducting interviews with experts. Seven of 
the initial lists of 11 barriers were identified as significant based on their average IOC scores exceeding 0.5. 
 
The study's key findings shed light on several insights. Firstly, circular economy principles offer a transformative 
paradigm for manufacturing, departing from the traditional linear model of production and consumption. These 
principles encompass designing for durability and repairability, recycling and material recovery, remanufacturing and 
reuse, and resource efficiency and optimization. Secondly, recent advancements and trends in circular economy 
practices, such as material innovation, digital technologies, and collaborative networks, demonstrate the potential for 
improved sustainability and efficiency in manufacturing processes. Lastly, successful case studies of companies like 
Interface Inc. and Philips illustrate the positive impact of circular economy principles on financial performance, 
including cost savings and revenue generation, as well as environmental sustainability through waste reduction and 
resource conservation. Implementing circular economy practices contributes to resource efficiency, waste reduction, 
and the preservation of natural resources, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and resilient manufacturing industry 
(Peter Onu et al., 2024c, 2024b, 2024a; Peter Onu et al., 2024b, 2024a; Peter Onu & Mbohwa, 2021c). Manufacturers 
benefit from long-term cost savings, enhanced competitiveness, and superior environmental performance. Further 
research should focus on identifying effective implementation strategies and exploring the role of government policies 
and incentives in supporting circular economy initiatives. 
 
Recommendations are provided for policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders to expedite the transition toward a 
circular economy in manufacturing. Policymakers are encouraged to sustain the development of regulatory 
frameworks that facilitate and incentivize circular economy practices, including clear targets, provisions for extended 
producer responsibility, and eco-design and product standards. Businesses should incorporate circular economy 
principles into their operations and strategies, investing in research and development, adopting innovative 
technologies, and collaborating with stakeholders across the value chain. Exploring new business models, such as 
product-as-a-service and sharing platforms, can also promote resource efficiency and drive changes in consumer 
behavior. Lastly, stakeholders should foster knowledge sharing and collaboration through industry associations, 
public-private partnerships, and dialogue platforms, facilitating the exchange of best practices, lessons learned, and 
success stories.

Abstract 
Digital twins are models that emulate the operations, conduct, and execution of physical products, systems, or 
processes dynamically in or close to real-time. Their efficacy depends on data from various sources, such as sensors 
and simulations. Digital twins offer several advantages, including predictive maintenance, minimizing downtime, 
enhancing the lifespan of machinery, and optimizing production processes. This optimization promotes sustainability 
in manufacturing by curbing energy consumption, improving material efficiency, and reducing environmental waste. 
Despite these benefits, digital twin technology has not yet reached its full potential in manufacturing. Therefore, this 
study highlights how proactive maintenance and process optimization can enhance sustainability outcomes. It also 
emphasizes the importance of efficiently utilizing robust data analytics, data governance, and modelling techniques. 
To provide a thorough understanding of this ground-breaking technology, the study undertakes a systematic literature 
review on the associated implications of using digital twins. The review examines potential opportunities, challenges, 
and ethical considerations that can enhance the efficacy and sustainability of manufacturing processes.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The dynamic landscape of the manufacturing industry is witnessing a profound transformation, propelled by rapid
advancements in digital technologies. Among the innovative approaches garnering significant attention, the concept
of digital twins is a promising solution (Onu & Mbohwa, 2021). Digital twins, dynamic virtual replicas of physical
products, systems, or processes, can simulate, monitor, and optimize real-time or near-real-time behaviors (Lee et al.,
2022; Zhou et al., 2020). Simultaneously, the pressing concern for sustainability has permeated various sectors,
encompassing transportation, energy, aerospace, and manufacturing (Lee et al., 2022; Onu & Mbohwa, 2021). The
urgency to curtail environmental impact, minimize energy consumption, optimize material efficiency, and mitigate
waste generation has never been more pronounced. Digital twins emerge as a beacon of hope in this context,
facilitating proactive maintenance and process optimization to bolster sustainability efforts (Rojek et al., 2021; Tao et
al., 2018).  Although the notion of digital twin technology was coined by Professor Michael Grieves at the University
of Michigan in 2002, its true potential was unlocked with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, rendering
it more cost-effective and accessible across diverse industries (Kuehn, 2018; Peter et al., 2023). As a result, businesses
worldwide are exploring the manifold applications of digital twins, seeking to enhance operational quality and
effectiveness (Tao et al., 2018).
In the context of manufacturing, we witness inspiring examples of digital twin technology. Unilever PLC, a global 
consumer goods giant, harnesses digital twins to streamline production processes, optimizing efficiency and flexibility 
(Alabi & Telukdarie, 2021). Chevron, a leading energy company, employs digital twins to gain real-time insights into 
1748","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Transparency and explainability are vital aspects of building trust in digital twin systems. As the technology 
becomes more complex and autonomous, clear explanations of decision-making processes and 
recommendations are crucial. Manufacturers must strive to make the inner workings of digital twins 
understandable and accessible to stakeholders, fostering informed decision-making and trust. 
• Intellectual Property Rights 
 
Responsible utilization of digital twin technology also requires compliance with relevant legal and regulatory 
considerations. Awareness of laws governing data privacy, intellectual property rights, and cybersecurity is 
essential to protect rights, respect intellectual property, and maintain the integrity and security of digital twin 
systems. 
 
 
Beyond technical aspects, ethical considerations extend to social and environmental impacts. Manufacturers must 
assess the broader implications of digital twin implementations on employees, communities, and the environment (Job 
Displacement and Worker Well-being). Addressing potential job displacement, promoting social equity, and 
considering environmental sustainability (Environmental Impact) are key aspects of responsible adoption (Shengli, 
2021). 
 
5. Conclusions 
In summary, this study has explored the potential of digital twins in improving sustainability within manufacturing 
processes with inference to the other nascent concepts covered in literature (Onu, Mbohwa, et al., 2024b, 2024a; Onu, 
Pradhan, et al., 2024a, 2024c, 2024b). Several key findings and contributions have been identified through an analysis 
of the concept, applications, and challenges. 
 
Digital twins offer significant advantages for sustainability in manufacturing. They enable proactive maintenance 
strategies, optimizing equipment performance and reducing downtime. By leveraging real-time data and advanced 
analytics, manufacturers can identify inefficiencies, minimize energy consumption, maximize material efficiency, and 
mitigate environmental waste. Digital twins provide a holistic view of the manufacturing ecosystem, facilitating data-
driven decision-making and fostering continuous process improvements. 
 
The importance of robust data governance practices, data analytics, and modeling techniques has been emphasized. 
Robust data governance ensures data integrity, security, and privacy, while data analytics techniques extract valuable 
insights for process optimization. Modeling techniques enhance the accuracy and realism of digital twin simulations, 
enabling manufacturers to make more informed decisions. 
 
Digital twins also raise ethical considerations like privacy, data security, algorithmic bias, and transparency. 
Responsible and ethical utilization of digital twin technology requires compliance with relevant laws and regulations, 
addressing biases, and ensuring transparency and explainability. 
 
There are several future directions and recommendations for further research in digital twin utilization. First, there is 
a need for standardized frameworks and protocols to enable seamless data integration and interoperability across 
diverse manufacturing systems.  
 
Furthermore, research can explore the integration of digital twins with emerging technologies such as the Internet of

intelligent manufacturing systems.  
 
In conclusion, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing processes by driving sustainability, 
enhancing efficiency, and enabling data-driven decision-making. Expanding the applications of digital twins to 
encompass supply chains and interconnect stakeholders presents avenues for enhancing sustainability and efficiency 
on a larger scale. Future research should focus on developing scalable architectures and cost-effective solutions to 
make digital twins accessible to various manufacturers, including smaller enterprises.

Abstract 
The project focuses on designing an ergonomic drive-thru fixture to reduce workplace injuries in the fast-food sector. 
It addresses the occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries among drive-thru workers, caused by repetitive leaning and 
awkward postures during long shifts. The project aims to develop a product that minimizes these risks, improving the 
working environment and employee satisfaction. An initial RULA assessment indicated a high-risk score, prompting 
the design of a fixture that attaches to drive-thru windows, reducing the need for leaning. The project considers factors 
such as cost, durability, simplicity, and efficiency, resulting in the development of a mechanical fixture as the optimal 
solution. This fixture moves forwards, backwards, and upwards, thus reducing the need for leaning. The prototype 
testing showed improved ergonomic conditions, with a lower RULA score, demonstrating the fixture's effectiveness 
in creating a safer work environment for drive-thru employees. The project’s impact extends to reducing healthcare 
costs and enhancing workplace safety and ergonomics.

1. Introduction
In 2023, the Saudi Arabian food sector was valued at $61.5 billion and is projected to grow annually by 4.13% (Statista, 
2023). With 70% of the population being young, the biggest segment in the food sector was found to be the fast-food 
segment due to the changes in lifestyle. The fast-food sector has multiple ways in which it serves food: dine-in, 
ordering at the counter (takeaway), ordering at a drive-thru (takeaway) or delivery (Morder Intelligence, 2021). As 
the young population values convenience, a drive-thru offers extreme comfort as one can order food or drinks without 
getting out of the car. The concept of a drive-thru has been around for decades and has grown even more in popularity 
in the past couple of years. A study conducted by Quantum (2021) has shown that 60% to 70% of most fast-food sales 
generated in the United States was from drive-thru windows. These fast-food chains tend to build drive-thru windows 
to give food to their customers without observing the physical motion of the labor at the window. The current design 
of the workstation at a drive-thru is not convenient and could result in physical injuries to the worker, as it requires 
the workers to lean for 8 to 10 hours during his/her working shift. 
The proposed project is to create a fixture that attaches to the drive-thru window, that can extend to the customer’s 
window, to decrease the amount of leaning required from both the drive-thru worker and the customer. Our product 
will mostly be used by the fast-food sector as these restaurants have a drive-thru service. Our product will greatly 
benefit the drive-thru workers as they are frequently exposed to repetitive leaning which can lead to back strains and 
shoulder injuries. 
1.1 Objectives  
The primary objective of this research is to design and test a mechanical fixture that can be added to existing drive-
thru windows, enabling movement in multiple directions to reduce the need for leaning; RULA will be used to assess

These recommendations aim to guide the effective implementation and continuous improvement of the drive-thru 
fixture, contributing to a safer and more ergonomic work environment for drive-thru workers. 
6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the layout of a workstation plays a big role in the safety and health of the worker. As we explored, 
simple changes in the layout of the drive-thru workstation can drastically reduce the chances of a worker getting 
injured. We proposed three design solutions that can help decrease the amount of leaning required from each drive-
thru worker: a window extension, a mechanical fixture, and an automatic conveyer belt. After analyzing these solutions 
against the design constraints and decision matrix criteria, we decided to implement the mechanical fixture as a 
response to the overall RULA assessment score of 5. The RULA assessment indicated that the current workstation 
imposes a high risk of injury and requires immediate change. The following conclusions can be derived:  
1.
Three solutions were proposed:
o
Window Extension: an extension to the existing window that will allow the drive-thru worker to slide orders
on. It will reduce the amount of leaning required from the drive-thru worker.
o
Mechanical Fixture: a fixture that can move in multiple directions (up/down and forward/backward)  using a
combination of mechanisms such as a lever or push/pull that will help reduce the amount of leaning that the
worker is required to do. The fixture will have an attached tray that has different depths to hold the drinks.
o
Automatic Conveyor Belt: a conveyer belt that is fully automated to move the order from the kitchen to the
drive-thru window. This requires automation and technologies to be used. This solution will ultimately
eliminate the need of a worker to stand at the drive-thru window.
2.
Design Solution Selection:
o
Based on the criterion, the mechanical fixture scored the highest (best) in terms cost, durability, simplicity,
efficiency, and maintenance.
o
The mechanical fixture was chosen to move forward to implementation, prototyping, and testing.
3.
Design Solution Impact:
o
The project successfully addressed the ergonomic challenges faced by drive-thru workers, significantly
reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.
4.
RULA Assessment:
o
The current workstation scored a 5 indicating a high risk of injury, specifically to the trunk area (scoring a
6).
o
The RULA assessment revealed a notable decrease in musculoskeletal risk, affirming that the drive-thru
fixture can substantially improve the ergonomic safety of workers compared to traditional workstations. The
use of the fixture decreased the risk of injury to 3, and drastically reduced the risk to the trunk areas (scoring
a 1).
o
The RULA assessment validated that our mechanical drive-thru fixture effectively mitigates ergonomic risks, 
particularly in the neck, trunk, and legs, offering a marked improvement over existing workstations.

Abstract 
Many emergency departments (EDs) have posted the predicted waiting time to see a doctor for workload balancing 
within their hospital network. Using a data-calibrated simulation model, we investigate the impact of operational 
factors, including the prediction accuracy, update frequency, and influence proportion, on the effectiveness of 
workload balancing. We find that with real-time, perfect prediction, the average patient waiting time decreases as the 
influence proportion increases. However, when the predicted waiting times are not sufficiently accurate or the 
predictions are not updated frequently enough, the average waiting time first decreases and then increases with the 
influence proportion.

Abstract 
The objective of this paper is to identify and improve the efficiency of the E2W conversion process at PT Spora EV 
using Systematic Layout Planning by considering work process activities and material movement. In-depth analysis 
showed that one unit of docking machine and three operators is the optimal allocation of human resources, resulting 
in an output of two vehicles. The optimization of the workshop layout has reduced the operational movement distance 
significantly, by 58.72% of the total, and optimized the area used to 5,082 𝑚𝑚2 or an area reduction of 17.74%.

1. Introduction
Indonesia, as Southeast Asia's largest vehicle market and a major nickel producer, has huge potential for electrical 
vehicle (EV) growth (Veza et al., 2022). In reality, out of the 125 million motorcycles in use in Indonesia as of the 
end of 2022, only 32,000 are electric (IESR, 2023; Statista, 2023). A 100% replacement of newly registered internal 
combustion engine (ICE) two-wheelers with battery-electric two-wheelers will significantly reduce gasoline

6. Conclusion 
Through a standardized time evaluation approach based on the Westinghouse parameter index, this study successfully 
determined the ideal number of machines and operators to increase the conversion output to two units at PT Spora 
EV. The study also showed that the application of systematic layout planning resulted in a 17.74% reduction in area 
utilization and a 58.72% cut in interprocess movement distance. This underscores the effectiveness of standardized 
layout design in optimizing the electric vehicle conversion process, which is crucial for the advancement of the electric 
automotive industry in Indonesia.

Abstract 
Rasa Raga Restaurant by Gemintang is a newly established food industry located in Depok, Indonesia. To provide the 
best possible service to customers, it is important for restaurants to continuously improve their operations. By having 
an optimal facility layout, restaurants can improve their workflow and operational efficiency, and improve customer 
service. This study seeks to evaluate Rasa Raga Restaurant's current facility layout using systematic layout planning 
(SLP) to enhance process efficiency within the restaurant and ergonomic approach using Ovako Working Posture 
Assessment System (OWAS) posture evaluation analysis. The data were identified through on-site observations and 
it was found that the layout of the kitchen and bar is still not effective for workers’ movement and material handling, 
and the space still can be optimized. Subsequently, an SLP analysis was conducted, employing Activity Relationship 
Chart (ARC), Activity Relationship Diagram (ARD), and Activity-Area Diagram (AAD) methodologies. Finally, a 
suitable layout and facilities arrangement along with the preparation table adjustable height recommendation feature 
was proposed to solve Rasa Raga Restaurant’s problems and achieve optimization objectives. The improved layout 
shows that the placement between stations is made based on their relationship as analyzed in ARC and ARD. An 
additional feature of adjustable height applied to the preparation table has been proven to make workers’ posture more 
comfortable when working.

6. Conclusion 
Facilities planning is a multifaceted process that is influenced by numerous factors and variables which can be done 
through several methods. In this paper, the researchers considered systematic layout planning, which is realized by 
the application and analysis of OPC, time standards, ARC, ARD, and AAD to create an optimal layout plan. We also 
analyze the ergonomics of the workers to improve their work by using the OWAS method. These methods then 
resulted in the recommendation layout, which changes the placement of stations to put them closer to another station 
they shared a closer relationship with by following the result we have gotten from the ARC and ARD analysis and 
was then visualized in the AAD. Another recommendation is for the preparation table to have an adjustable height 
feature to make workers’ posture more comfortable when working. Further research could be done on the restaurant 
to validate this recommendation and continuously improve the conditions of the restaurant.

Abstract 
P.T. EDS Manufacturing Indonesia is a company that manufactures wire harnesses for vehicles. The outdated layout 
causes various challenges in the wire harness assembly line, such as excessive material handling costs. The initial step 
in constructing a new alternative layout is to measure process and layout data, determine time standards, and material 
handling, and continue in making an alternative layout using SLP methods. From the two alternative layouts created, 
alternative layout 2 features closeness from the external warehouse to every supply station and allocates every 
workstation to be sequentially and rotational layout allocation, resulting in an improvement of using 18 workers, 72 
unit hourly production, and efficiency of 97.7%. SimPy simulation validates the proposed layout’s material handling 
cost and daily production. The result showed an improvement of a decrease of 13.9% in material handling cost and an 
increase of 3.92% in daily production.

From the new alternative layouts made by using the Systematic Layout Planning (S.L.P.) method, two alternatives 
was created, called alternative layout one and alternative layout 2. The new layouts effectively reduced the number of 
workers, hour production output, and efficiency. Comparing the two alternatives, Alternative Layout 2 demonstrated 
superior outcomes with 18 workers, an hourly production of 72 units, and an efficiency of 97.7%. Validation was done 
using SimPy simulation in Python to analyze the material handling cost and production efficiency. The results showed 
that the chosen alternative layout reduces material handling cost by 13.9% from $78.96 to $69.30, average production 
takt time by 3.97% from 0.838 minutes to 0.806 minutes, and daily production increased by 3.92% from 1020 to 1060. 
An alternative layout can increase monthly production from 24216 units to 25524 units.

Abstract 
Shop & Drive is a vehicle service chain operating in the after-sales service sector, focusing on swift service and quick 
turnover of parts for car and motorcycle maintenance. However, one of their workshops located in Margonda faces 
significant challenges in optimizing its service area, affecting customer service efficiency. This study utilizes 
Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) methods to revamp the facility layout at Shop & Drive Margonda by processing 
field data using various techniques such as Activity Relationship Chart, Activity Relationship Diagram, Area 
Allocation Diagram, and material flow analysis to propose alternative layouts. The resulting layout adjustments 
significantly reduced non-operational areas in the workshop by 47.8%, reduced material flow movement for the car 
oil change service process and the car shock absorber replacement service process by 47.42% and 42.84% respectively 
and reduced the number of operators from 7 to 6 workers.

Abstract 
Ergonomics is an applied scientific discipline that aims to understand the interactions between humans and other 
elements of the system to improve the well-being and efficiency of individuals, safety, and productivity of the system 
in general. Ergonomics helps to create a job that suits the worker so that the work becomes safer and more efficient. 
For this senior design project, we, applied Digital Human Modelling (DHM) simulation to overcome ergonomic 
challenges at warehouses in Kuwait. Warehouses are work environments where manual material handling duties are 
performed, which can result in various effects on the human body, including the development of Musculoskeletal 
Disorders (MSDs). MSDs are medical problems that impact the muscles, joints, tendons, nerves, and ligaments. 
Furthermore, the occurrence and severity of MSDs might increase if the problem is not addressed swiftly or 
proactively. Several ailments, including tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, gout, rotator cuff injuries, and tendonitis, are 
classified as MSDs. This project presents a DHM simulation study and its results conducted in various warehouses in 
Kuwait, including products-COOP, a factory that produces refrigerators and water coolers, and a worldwide logistics 
shipping company. The aim of the project is to address and find solutions for workplace MSDs. The Nordic 
Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) was employed to assess the physical well-being of the warehouse employees. 
The JACK software was employed to analyze the workers' postures in order to identify and rectify the primary issue 
to be avoided.

Abstract 
Improving productivity has been a key priority in the warehouse industry to meet the target demand. One of the 
most important factors influencing productivity is space utilization. This research analysis is carried out to 
determine the warehouse capacity utilization rate and its long-term viability. This study employs the Symptom 
Versus Problems Theory (SVP), mathematical computation, and related simulation. Many studies project that space 
utilization is the root cause of the entire network problem for the case company's warehouse that was selected for 
this study. The scenario was further estimated using a Frazelle Model, combined with discrete event simulation. A 
new layout design was built and displayed, including the key activities and operational areas with better space 
utilization and process throughput.

1. Introduction
Logistics is an important element of daily operations. The ability of the organization to competently manage
logistical operations can decrease unnecessary energy consumption, operational expenses, and improve
productivity. An organization must designate appropriate resources to create warehouse operations that
necessitates optimal space utilization for proper storage and material handling (Kusrini, Novendri, & Helia,
2018). Ranging from 40,000 sqft to 500,000 sqft, at startup majority of the warehouse area is often wide and
spacious in order to accomodate workstations and inventory. But then, the space is seemed to diminished on
its own after years of operating. study by (Karim, Abdul Rahman, & Syed Johari Shah, 2018) shows that the
top 3 reasons of warehouse failure factors are labor productivity, warehouse space utilization, and inventory
space utilization (Karim et al., 2018). This indeed show that under the banner of space insufficiency,
warehouse daily operations may be affected when workers have limited amount of working area as their
movement to conduct the activities are limited(Wang & Hua, 2019). Furthermore when the space are not
properly utilized, managers may found it hard to store their companies inventory when on paper, there are
actually more space to occupied but physically the warehouse are packed and full with boxes of inventory
which lead to usage of external parties such as warehouse rental & container. These events will increase the
cost beared by the company. To prevent this event from happening, warehouse optimization process must be
executed. A study was conducted by (Caridade, Pereira, Pinto Ferreira, & Silva, 2017) in optimization of
warehouse aspects by using Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). WMS is a very recommended tool in
enhancing warehouse efficiency since the all the informations are being control over by the warehouse
personnel. The study showed the redesign of the layout are based on the data of product amount and the
frequentness of picking based on the information provide by WMS. On the other hand, the cost and time
taken for implementing doesn’t favour the the business goals which contemplating with cost reduction and

as it does not absorb the heat but reflect it back to space. Installing on the warehouse roof, radiant barriers are very 
useful if you utilize the warehouse for storing things that require low temperature. It consists of reflective material 
like foil. 
 
Regarding the natural cooling of the temperature, the use of High-Volume Low Speed (HVLS) fans aids in the 
sustainability aspect since the size of the fans and their blades allows for the use of low speed to adequately reduce 
the warehouse temperature. The large blades justify the 'High Volume' element, which allows it to cover a wide range 
of warehouse spaces. Low speed means lower electricity costs and less energy released, which saves the environment. 
The drainage converter system helps the environment by promoting reduced water use in the building on a daily basis. 
Mainly channel towards the toilet and tap water tank, the water consumed every day is only specialized in drinking. 
This will cut cost of water bills charge on the company.  
 
5.5 Conclusions 
Managing warehouse efficiency while adhering to the sustainability element has emerged as a prominent problem in 
today's logistics industry. There are several objectives and KPIs to meet while dealing with the continuous business 
problems of today's trends. Previous research has primarily focused on the broad KPIs of warehouse productivity and 
the foundations of warehouse storage. Future research should concentrate on other KPIs, such as order picking 
productivity and cycle time, to quantify performance and strive for top performance in warehouse activities. Previous 
studies on sustainable warehouses focused on the broad elements and advantages of sustainability but did not identify 
the specific measures that other parties may take to adopt it, despite the continued problem of logistic businesses being 
unaware of sustainable warehouses. Given that this study has focused on the environmental and economic dimensions 
of sustainability, further research on the social dimension of sustainability in warehouse operations has to be 
prioritized. The contributions of this study includes the improved warehouse layout for the company that acts as a 
reference for other companies as well. The utilization rate has been calculated on both layouts to describe the ground 
reality of the warehouse challenges faced. The discrete even simulation teachnique has been adopted to capture the 
discrete events of the warehouse to  capture complex activities. A display of present and future state digital twin of 
the warehouse has been projected in this study better decision making.

Abstract 
Airlines offer a variety of flight ticket options at different price levels. The application of diverse revenue management 
models by airlines can result in significant price disparities, leading to scenarios where two passengers on the same 
flight, seated adjacent, may pay markedly different fares. This phenomenon often incentivizes passengers to book 
their tickets well in advance. However, this strategy entails a risk of purchasing tickets that may ultimately go unused. 
One proposed solution to mitigate this issue is offering various ticketing options. Such options include varied ticket 
classes with distinct features, additional services enabling ticket return or reissue, and price hold options. This study 
analyzes the impact of different ticket classes, extra services, and price hold options on customer satisfaction, airline 
revenue, and flight capacity utilization. The study commences with a comprehensive analysis of these various options. 
Subsequently, a survey involving 103 respondents from Kuwait was conducted. Passenger preferences were analyzed 
to determine their inclination towards purchasing ticket options and at what price levels they are likely to buy different 
flight options. Additionally, the analysis covered airline class preferences and customer priorities regarding in-flight 
amenities. A Monte Carlo analysis was utilized to conduct a feasibility study of these ticket options. Survey data was 
utilized to model stochastic customer behavior and preference patterns at diverse price points. The findings suggest 
that the introduction of these options enhances airline profitability, flight capacity utilization, and customer 
satisfaction.

Abstract 
Every company, including the food and beverage industry shares the same goal, to increase productivity in 
operational activities. Productivity enhancement is a key factor indicating a company's development. The layout 
of production facilities plays an important role in improving a company's efficiency to ensure smooth production 
processes. This research evaluates a cake production factory facility layout and material handling, focusing on 
challenges from the significant distances between stations. Problems were identified through direct observation 
and interviews with the factory manager. Employing the Systematic Layout Planning method with ARC and 
dimensionless diagrams, an analysis was conducted to propose an optimized layout and material handling. The 
proposed improvements, derived from a keen analysis of workflow sequences and resource allocation, have 
been validated to substantially decrease the distance of material flow, thereby leading to reduced handling cost 
and enhancing overall productivity.

Based on the post-improvement table, there is a notable reduction in the total distance of movement, which correlates 
with increased efficiency and reduced Operational Material Handling (OMH) cost. These improvements highlight the 
importance of meticulous facility design and underscore the potential for significant cost savings and productivity 
enhancements. The moment of movement and OMH cost calculation serves not only as a measure of current efficiency 
but also as a guide for continuous improvement in manufacturing facility operations.

Abstract 
Efficient inventory management in various industries relies on effective spare parts classification. In this study, the 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is employed as a machine learning classification method to categorize 
spare parts inventory. The objective of the study is to enhance the understanding of spare parts classification and 
provide practitioners with valuable insights for informed inventory management decisions. By applying the SVM 
algorithm to a dataset of 500 spare parts and conducting a thorough analysis, this study provides insights into the 
potential applications and limitations of the method. The findings highlight the SVM classifier model's notable 
predictive accuracy.

1. Introduction
Effective spare parts classification plays a crucial role in achieving efficient inventory management across various 
industries, as it ensures that the right parts are readily accessible when needed. Industries like food production heavily 
rely on their spare parts inventory to ensure uninterrupted flow of operations by maintaining the availability of 
necessary components and equipment for timely repairs and maintenance. Efficient spare parts management directly 
enhances production efficiency and overall operational effectiveness. Conversely, inefficient spare parts management 
can lead to challenges such as an overabundance of spare parts, increased inventory costs, and suboptimal warehouse 
space utilization. To address these issues, it is essential to establish effective spare parts management practices that 
ensure the prompt, accurate, and cost-effective availability of spare parts while optimizing warehouse operations. 
The ABC classification method is widely used to categorize items based on their relative importance and cost. This 
method enables organizations to prioritize inventory items by focusing on high-value items that contribute

classification outcomes. Moreover, considering the diverse inventory characteristics across different industry sectors, 
it is essential to investigate the performance of machine learning algorithms specific to each sector, taking into account 
factors such as perishability and diversity. 
6. Conclusion  
Due to the significant volume of inventories held by many companies, considerable attention is devoted to inventory 
classification, and diverse management tools are employed for different classes. The ABC classification, which applies 
the Pareto principle, is a widely utilized analytical method for categorizing inventory into three classes: A, B, and C. 
However, inventory classification should be viewed as a multi-criteria problem, as the traditional ABC method relies 
on a single criterion. 
 
To address this limitation, this study utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) to consider multiple criteria in inventory 
classification. The SVM algorithm achieves an impressive 87% accuracy in classifying inventory. While this study 
represents an initial exploration of machine learning accuracy in inventory classification, it is recommended to replace 
traditional classification methods that overlook critical data features and rely on a single criterion. Advanced methods 
like SVM and other classification approaches that utilize various data features should be adopted. This is particularly 
crucial in the era of Big Data to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of inventory management.

Abstract 
The emerging agro-processors in South Africa are struggling to participate in the mainstream retail market in the 
country although they have potential. This study aimed to outline the challenges faced by the South African Limpopo 
Province-based emerging agro-processors. The study was conducted on 16 emerging agro-processors in the form of 
in-depth interviews, through which a thorough needs analysis was conducted using an unstructured interview 
technique. Concerning the analysis of data, this study conducted content analysis on the data that was collected. This 
was then written in the form of a case study. It was found in this study that challenges faced by emerging agro-
processors range from capacity planning, working stations, financial resources, poor logistics, appropriate technology, 
and rigid compliance administration. These are proposed to be solved by a think tank that will address technological, 
logistical, and financial challenges. It is recommended that the should be a relook into the rigid compliance documents. 
A future study will focus on expanding the study to include other provinces so that authors can make a holistic 
recommendation about what should be done by emerging agro-processors.

Abstract 
In the matter of clean energy, wind power is considered one of the most reliable and sustainable alternatives. Thanks 
to the progressed technology and diminishing expenses, its adoption has multiplied in the latest years. However, before 
the wind can become the most viable form of alternative energy, there are specific barriers we need to overcome. 
Conventional turbines have been known for their complex manufacture, expensive transportation, intermittence, and 
high maintenance cost. The vortex bladeless wind turbine (VBWT) is considered an advanced design that harvests 
energy from oscillation. This study focuses on optimizing VBWT design parameters using the Taguchi method to 
enhance electrical power production. Through meticulous analysis and mathematical modelling, we examine factors 
such as mast and rod lengths, diameters, and thicknesses.  Numerical results show that the produced power of the 20 
meters long turbine is around three times greater in comparison to the initial VBWT output. The increase rate is 176% 
at a wind speed of 7 m/s. The power produced by the optimal turbine reached 3.44 KW, while the production of the 
initial VBWT was only 1.25 KW. The output power can be further maximized at an optimum external load. In the 
future, this study will be continued to enhance the overall performance of the bladeless wind turbine through the 
integration of the offshore wind turbine with tidal power.

1. Introduction
Renewable energy is the future of the globe, it considerably reduces carbon dioxide emissions when compared to 
conventional energy resources. Producing renewable power involves harnessing nature's plentiful and vast elements 
to generate electricity. In line with the international Renewable electricity organization (IRENA), renewable energy 
can offer 90 percent of the world's energy by 2050 (A, 2020).Statistics show that renewable energy sources currently 
account for more than a third of the overall worldwide energy production (Ellabban et al., 2014). 
In the realm of clean energy, wind power stands out as one of the most reliable and sustainable alternatives. Despite 
its promising potential, there are barriers that need to be addressed before wind energy can become the foremost viable 
alternative. Traditional wind turbines, while effective in generating electricity from wind, are burdened with several 
disadvantages. These include complex manufacturing processes, costly transportation, intermittent performance, and 
high maintenance requirements. As engineers, we have a responsibility to face these challenges and improve the 
options for the energy sector. 
However, innovative solutions such as the vortex bladeless wind turbine (VBWT) are emerging to overcome these 
challenges. Developed by Vortex Spain, the VBWT represents a paradigm shift in wind turbine design, eliminating 
traditional rotor blades in favor of a more streamlined and efficient approach. VWTs boast a flexible cylindrical design 
capable of harnessing energy from moving air streams through vortex-induced vibration (VIV) methods. VBWT can

The decision of whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis 𝐻𝐻0 will be based on the P-Value, which is a probability 
that measures the evidence against the null hypothesis 𝐻𝐻0 . In this study, alpha equals 0.05 and the obtained P-Value 
of the test is less than alpha, see Figure 8. Therefore, it is assumed that the experimental data does not follow a normal 
distribution.  
 
3. Conclusion and Recommendation 
Wind energy has become a main part of the global renewable energy sector, and the dependence on it is anticipated 
to increase in the foreseeable future. At present, traditional wind turbines are the most used machines to transform 
wind energy into electrical energy. The issues associated with traditional wind turbines include transportation 
problems, high maintenance costs, and harmful environmental impacts. These downsides lead to a consideration of 
the Vortex Bladeless Wind Turbine (VBWT), which focuses on less space requirement, less impact on wildlife, zero 
noise, as well as having fewer moving components, which means less wear and tear, and lower maintenance costs. 
The suitable size of this turbine also makes it simple to install in homes, schools, and any location. 
 
The main objective of this study was to optimize the potential energy production of a vortex wind turbine using 
mathematical models. In the process of devising the tools to achieve that goal, the Taguchi method had to be created 
for VBWT design parameters. For the measurement of VBWT dimensions, the VORTEX Bladeless ® 3D model was 
used.  
 
The main findings of this study can be summarized in the following points: 
1. The optimal values of VBWT design parameters are:  
 
 𝐿𝐿𝑚𝑚= 20 𝑚𝑚 , 𝐿𝐿𝑟𝑟= 2.5 𝑚𝑚 , 𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚= 0.4 𝑚𝑚 , 𝐷𝐷𝑟𝑟= 0.04 𝑚𝑚 , 𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚= 0.1 , 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟= 0.02 𝑚𝑚   
  
2. The output power of optimal VBWT is 3.44 KW. It increased from 1.25 KW for the initial design parameters 
to 3.44 KW. 
3. The most significant design parameter is the length of the turbine, which takes the first rank in Taguchi 
design. 
Future work concerns pursuing the following directions to improve the model: 
1. In this study, a cylindrical shape of the mast was used to follow the VORTEX Bladeless® model, but 
designing a conical mast shape may achieve perfect synchronization of the vortex shedding all along the 
mast. Given that the wind velocity in the atmospheric boundary layer increases with height, the diameter of 
the oscillating structure should also increase with height to favour synchronization.

2. Although only uniform flows were tested in this study, it would be very effective to simulate the efficiency 
of VBWT under the dynamics of an atmospheric boundary layer. Furthermore, additional research would 
allow for determining the most efficient shape for the mast to optimize the synchronization of vortex shedding 
along the height of the mast that maximizes output power 
3. The Integration of offshore wind with tidal energy can maximize the system's output.

1. Introduction
Several years after the COVID-19 pandemic, industries around the world were still being affected (Nurnazmi et al. 
2021; Fitri and Zuryani, 2022). Certain industries had demonstrated resilience and recovery efforts, while others, 
unable to withstand the negative impacts of the storm, had collapsed (Salleh and Bushroa, 2022). This happened not 
only in the whole world but also within Indonesia, reach out across essential, secondary, and tertiary industries (Johan 
G. Ony 2021). Among those significantly affected was the songket industry, which experienced a considerable impact
(Feri et al. 2022).
The main object of this study is the songket industry situated in North Sumatra, Indonesia. There was a period of time 
when the Songket industry experienced a decrease in demand, requiring the reduction of workforce (Feri et al. 2022; 
Wati et al. 2022). As consumer trust returned and buying power increased, orders for songket resumed. However, 
producing with the current number of workforces posed challenges for the industry (Wati et al. 2022; Damanik et al. 
2021; Nurnazmi et al. 2021). After implementing several different approaches, the profitability did not increase as 
planned, which frequently led to supply delays (Fonseca et al. 2022; Bashan and Notea 2018; Dachyar and Sanjiwo 
2018).

Abstract 
Leadership has been viewed as a subdivision of management which focuses on individual influences within a group 
towards achieving a common goal, while productivity and sustainability is the capability to preserve a stability 
between the needs of the organization and those of the worker. The element of leadership, employee productivity and 
sustainability seem to share significant value within an organization, however the question that is left unanswered is 
how then leadership has an impact on employee productivity and sustainability. This paper seeks to explore the impact 
of leadership on employee productivity and sustainability within an organization. A quantitative methodological 
approach was selected for this study to comprehend the impact that leadership has on employee productivity and 
sustainability. A questionnaire consisting of three sections was distributed to middle and lower ranking workers at an 
organization in South Africa. The result from the study clearly indicates that leadership has a philosophical impact on 
employee productivity. The adaptation of a transformational leadership style by the leader with attributes such as 
intellectual inspiration, personalized consideration, idealized influence, and motivation stimulate positive outcomes 
from a worker, which results in achievement of desirable outcome. This leadership style effectively creates a positive 
working environment for workers to foster productivity and contribute to long-term success of the organization. In 
conclusion, the data collected with literature share the same reverence to say leadership does have an impact on 
employee productivity and sustainability through the implementation of a transformational leadership style by the 
leader. The outcome of the workers will always be predetermined by the type of leadership style that the leader adapts 
to. The study provides to the existing body of knowledge on leadership and employee productivity and sustainability 
through expansively discussing whether leadership has an impact on employee productivity and sustainability. The 
previous studies indicated multiple limitations on the role of a leader. This study goes further to look at the relationship 
and attributing factors that contribute to leaders having an impact on employee productivity and sustainability.

1. Introduction
The risk associated with remaining relevant and competitive as organizations continuous to increase while the ability 
of creating a healthy work environment is decreasing due to fast changes and emerging technologies (Alblooshi et al., 
2020). The success of an organization continuous to be one of the key objectives of any association, hence leadership 
and worker’s contribution are some of the factors that crucially impact to success status of the organization (Setiawan 
et al.,2021). Leadership has been viewed as a subdivision of management which focuses on individual influences 
within a group towards achieving a common goal (Mouton, 2017), while productivity has been defined in numerous 
contexts and at various levels as the correlation amid inputs and outputs (Olasanmi et al., 2021).  Employee 
sustainability is described as the ability of a worker to remain in one organization (Saluy et al 2021). The element of 
leadership, employee productivity and employee sustainability seem to share the significant value within an

Abstract 
In this work, we propose a novel framework for the development of real-time large-scale production scheduling. The 
problem that we study originated from the Digital Innovation Headquarters division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
Ltd. (MHI), which faced the challenge of developing a large-scale just-in-time (JIT) job-shop scheduling software that 
could schedule up to a quarter million jobs and 6.2 million operations within an hour. We designed the algorithm for 
scheduling and used list data structure for storing the resource availability. We used Ousterhout matrix as a benchmark,

1.Introduction
Information and communication technologies (ICT) such as, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing 
Execution Systems (MES), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI),  and more recently Internet of Things (IoT) have 
enabled us to collect detailed manufacturing, maintenance and operations related data from disparate sources such as 
sensors, embedded software feeds, and human interventions (Mithas et al., 2022). This digital transformation of the 
manufacturing ecosystem has greatly enabled the efficient use of input resources (Choi et al., 2022) and the adoption 
of lean manufacturing practices (Shah & Ward, 2003).  In particular, the digitalization of manufacturing and services 
has generated various opportunities to improve the functioning of job shop scheduling problems (JSSP) to implement 
just-in-time (JIT) production (Ashton James, 1989). And it is imperative for the shop floor managers to embrace this 
digital transformation to develop the digital intelligence strategies to meet the objectives of lean manufacturing 
(Mithas et al., 2022). 
Recently, Digital Innovation Headquarters division of a Japanese multinational company1 faced the challenge of 
developing a large-scale JIT job-shop scheduling platform that could schedule up to a quarter million jobs and 6.2 
million operations within an hour. These jobs were generated from various manufacturing plants located at multiple 
locations across the globe. Each job consists of a set of linearly ordered operations with a fixed precedence relation

For the computational experiments, we used a computer with following specifications: Intel®, coreTM i7-6500U, CPU 
@ 2.50 GHz and 8 GB RAM, Windows 10, 64 bits. The total runtime for the Ousterhout matrix and our scheduling 
algorithms were 6 and 0.6 minutes, respectively. Our approach leads to almost 10 times reduction in runtime for this 
test case. As we move towards scheduling millions of operations in real-time this gain will have significant 
implications. As highlighted earlier, the major challenge in generating an implementable scheduling algorithm is 
finding a free slot for scheduling on a limited resource quickly while honoring all constraints. We are developing a 
new set of algorithms for this specific task to reduce the polynomial dependence of Algorithm 3 on the timestamps, 
i.e., 𝑂𝑂൫𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐
∗2൯, and intend to share these findings in near future.  
 
4.3 Implications and Conclusion 
In this research, we develop a set of algorithms for large-scale JSSP which considers many real-life constraints such 
as, daily working shifts, release and due dates for a job, multiple quantity of a resource, and calendar dates. 
Incorporating all these constraints in a real-time scheduling algorithm calls for developing a novel scheduling 
framework that simplifies the process for finding the valid timeslot and updating the quantity of each limited resource. 
We achieve it by developing algorithms for maintaining resource availability over the given time horizon, job 
prioritization, scheduling, and resource update. We also highlight the role of careful selection of data structures for 
storing and retrieving different information related to real-life scheduling. We selected Ousterhout Matrix as a 
benchmark and show that our approach significantly improves the runtime significantly. These all are novel 
contributions of this work, and our scheduling framework creates new opportunities for designing and selecting better 
dispatching rules for real-time large-scale scheduling. 
 
The importance of JIT scheduling is well recognized in manufacturing (Srinivasan et al., 1994). The advent of Industry 
4.0, and the digitalization of manufacturing processes has enabled real-time interaction between digital and physical 
resources through “smart connections”, and manufacturing and production related data collection from disparate 
sources such as sensors, information and communication technologies, and monitoring instrumentation (Choi et al., 
2022). However, the opportunities created by the digitalization of manufacturing processes using these technologies 
have not been leveraged to a large extent to improve the JIT manufacturing practices5. In this context, our research 
makes a novel contribution by developing a scheduling framework for real-life large-scale JSSP. 
 
In the current work we only use one dispatching rule, namely critical ratio, to demonstrate the promise of our 
framework in generating real-time scheduling.  However, production scheduling must be designed to respond to real-

time deviations in terms of new job arrivals, shop floor condition etc. In this context, machine learning and AI 
techniques are increasingly used for job-shop scheduling (Choi et al., 2022). Our work could be extended to switch 
the dispatching rules used for scheduling under different shop conditions. This selection can be made using a machine 
learning model that identifies a best dispatching given shop, job, and external constraints such as, scheduling horizon, 
due and release dates of a job (Parente et al., 2020). This is a direct extension of the current work, which we are 
working on and plan to share these results soon. 
The processing of an operation may require multiple resources, perhaps with different working shifts. Also, in real-
life a schedule must consider the interruptions due to maintenance or unavailability of a worker. These are also the 
possible extensions that we are working on in the ongoing research.

Abstract 
This paper investigates real-world data from a PVC manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia to construct predictive 
statistical models leveraging machine learning techniques. The primary aim is to identify prevalent failures and predict 
their timing based on historical incidents. The study introduces the Random-Forest-Classifier algorithm to refine the 
dataset and enhance accuracy. Subsequently, the results are applied to simulation modeling, providing insights into 
proactive action and opportunistic maintenance behavior within PVC manufacturing. The motivation of the research 
was to reduce the sudden breakdown in the factory and provide practical recommendations to optimize maintenance 
practices, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. The paper concludes with a simulation model illustrating the use 
of opportunistic actions that support the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) resulting from the predictive model's 
insights.

1. Introduction
In the rapidly evolving landscape of industries, the integration of automated processes, machine learning, and

only a strategic move but also a necessity to stay competitive and align with the transformative Industry 4.0 trends. 
Programming is crucial for production lines as it enables the automation of processes, facilitates efficient control of 
machinery (ALRIDHA et al., 2022), and allows for the employment of advanced technologies, contributing to 
increased productivity and the utilization of smart operations. The process of finding the best strategy to optimize a 
process is critical. Simulation on the other hand plays a pivotal role in understanding the system behavior and applying

Equation 2 outlines the accuracy variance between the statistical model outcomes and the machine learning results 
concerning the failure rate (failures per hour) across all machines. Table 3 presents the validation findings, where the 
statistical data originates from two years of historical data. The failure rate is extracted based on the prevailing 
behavior of the current system. In contrast, the machine learning algorithm, specifically the Random-Forest-Classifier, 
is employed to refine predictions using data aimed at optimizing the opportunistic maintenance strategy, as explained 
in Figure 6. Despite encountering higher failure rates in the extruder, die, cutter, and socketing machines due to 
insufficient input data, the algorithm demonstrates remarkable accuracy. The Random-Forest-Classifier 's precision 
serves to preempt sudden breakdowns or corrective repairs by facilitating the proactive implementation of preventive 
maintenance. This strategic approach significantly reduces downtime, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and 
productivity. Through its predictive capabilities, the algorithm contributes to fostering a proactive maintenance 
culture, mitigating disruptions, and optimizing overall system performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study pioneers a methodology that combines machine learning, particularly the Random-Forest-
Classifier, with advanced statistical analysis to effectively preprocess data and identify system failures and 
bottlenecks. This methodology was then verified with a simulation model to carefully examine the strategy's 
performance over time. The research introduces opportunistic maintenance which was carefully implemented in the 
simulation model utilizing Simio a very high-resolution software with more than a hundred replications, Further results 
will be explored in future publications. This strategy primarily aims to reduce corrective repairs and breakdown-
induced maintenance tasks, thus enhancing operational efficiency and resilience against disruptions. This approach 
underscores the transformative potential of merging machine learning and statistical analysis in industrial contexts, 
offering innovative methodologies for maintenance optimization.

Investigating the Effect of Varying Surrounding Conditions 
on The Degradation of Starch/Nylon-1010 Blend

Abstract 
This research aims to investigate the effect of varying surrounding conditions on the degradation of biobased polymers, 
specifically Nylon-1010. As Nylon-1010 is not biodegradable by itself, starch will be used as a filler or backbone to 
allow its degradation. The study will build upon existing literature in the field of biopolymer degradation. Previous 
research has primarily focused on investigating individual factors' influence on degradation, such as temperature or 
pH. Several studies have also examined the degradation behaviour of specific biopolymers, such as polylactic acid 
(PLA) or polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). However, there is a lack of comprehensive research exploring the combined 
effects of multiple surrounding conditions on the degradation of Nylon-1010. This study aims to bridge this gap by 
providing a broader understanding of the degradation process of a novel biopolymer and its dependence on 
surrounding conditions. This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by examining the degradation rates of a 
starch/Nylon-1010 blend under various environmental factors. The study will be divided into the Background, 
Methods, Results and Conclusion.

1. Introduction
Nylon-1010, also referred to as polyamide-1010, is a synthetic polymer created using the polycondensation chemical 
process. due to its uncommon chemical structure which, when incorporated with a starch-based backbone, becomes 
biodegradable. The production of Nylon-1010 involves the reaction of two main monomers: decanedioic acid (sebacic 
acid) and 1,10-diaminodecane. Each of these monomers contains ten carbon atoms, reflected by the ""1010"" in the 
nylon's name. The chemical reaction between these monomers is a sort of polycondensation in which water is removed 
as a by-product. This reaction results in the creation of polymer by forming lengthy chains of repeating units. 
The presence of a starch-based backbone in Nylon-1010 is what contributes to its biodegradability. Starch is a complex 
carbohydrate that, through a process known as hydrolysis, can be broken down by enzymes produced by various 
microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. These enzymes can cleave the glycosidic bonds between the glucose 
molecules in starch, transforming it into simpler compounds that microbes can metabolise. In the case of Nylon-1010, 
microbial enzymes can target and break down the polymer's starch-based segments, so commencing the degradation 
process. As the starch component undergoes hydrolysis, the overall polymer structure becomes more susceptible to 
further degradation. This degradation can be affected by various environmental factors including microbial activity, 
temperature, pH, moisture content, and even the type of soil.  
2.
Literature Review
The biodegradability of Starch/Nylon-1010 arises from its unique chemical structure, combining a starch-based 
backbone with polyamide-1010. Microbial enzymes initiate the degradation process by targeting glycosidic bonds in 
starch, rendering the polymer susceptible to further breakdown. Microbial diversity and enzyme efficiency

4. Results and Discussion 
Looking at all three graphs, we can deduce that the rate of degradation was the highest in acidic samples with a higher 
moisture content (1.37% per day). Under basic conditions and the same moisture content, the rate was substantially 
lower (0.72 % per day). The change in degradation rate under the same pH implies the effect of moisture content and 
the difference in degradation rates in different pH samples with the same moisture content indicates the effect of pH. 
In each of the pH samples, the 20 ml moisture content sample relatively had the highest rates. When placed in acidic 
conditions, the circular films experienced the most drastic change when the moisture content was changed, with the 
increase in degradation rate being 0.58% (from 0.49% to 1.07%). Whereas, when the degradation rate decreased by 
0.29% when the films were placed in basic conditions compared to acidic conditions. In addition, looking at the graphs, 
we can see that the gradient of the graph is not as drastically affected in different pH samples as it is in different 
moisture content samples for the same pH.  
 
This elucidates that the moisture content of soil has more impact on the degradation rate compared to its acidity. The 
effect of moisture content can be substantiated by various factors such as hydrolysis, microbial activity, and diffusion 
rate. To allow the breakdown of the starch filler in the blend, hydrolysis needs to occur, making water a crucial factor 
in the efficient breakdown of starch which would further lead to the breakdown of starch. A higher moisture content 
also facilitates microbial activity, especially the metabolic processes of bacteria and fungi, which plays a vital role in 
breaking down the polymer chains. In a wetter environment, enzymes and products of degradation can easily diffuse 
to or away from the reaction site. This explains why, in all three pH samples, the degradation rate was substantially 
higher in the 10 or 20 ml moisture samples compared to those with none. The primary role of pH in the breakdown of 
the Nylon 1010/Starch blend is to provide the optimal pH range for enzymes such as lipase or amylase that accelerate 
the rate of degradation. Although, this may not increase the degradation rate (the rates in the control and the acidic 
medium are very similar), it can notably decrease the degradation rate if the pH conditions lie outside the pH range of 
the enzymes (the rates in the basic medium were much lower). 
 
This analysis can be used to affirm the biodegradability of a Nylon 1010/Starch Blend. Therefore, a waste management 
technique for Nylon 1010 can be composed. In today’s time, polymer waste and crop management are both critical 
issues as incineration is the cheapest method to dispose of the waste, leading to an alarming increase in air pollution. 
Nylon 1010 itself is not biodegradable, but the crop waste can be utilized as a substitute to the starch filler to make a 
blend. This blend can be deposited in landfills with a naturally high moisture content and an acidic pH to expedite the 
degradation. Hence, by this method, both polymer and crop waste management can be addressed in a cheap and 
efficient manner.  
 
5. Conclusions 
In conclusion, this research aimed to explore the degradation of Nylon 1010/Starch blend under different 
environmental conditions. The study complemented other research by examining the effects of pH and moisture 
content, which are often disregarded when exploring degradation. All pH ranges showed an increased propensity 
towards faster degradation when confronted with elevated moisture content. Moisture fuels microbial activity, 
diffusion, 
and

This study's consequences stretch further than just scientific interest. The findings hold significant importance,

Abstract 
This research article proposes the application of Lean Total Quality Management (TQM) and Systematic Layout 
Planning (SLP) tools to review, standardize and improve the car wash process of a SME in Peru. With SLP an 
improvement in the distribution of the washing station is proposed. Within TQM, the PDCA cycle tools were applied 
to identify problems and the 5S methodology to have improvements within each activity. Under the simulation of the 
proposed model validated with the Arena software, an 11% increase in the station's productivity was achieved based 
on a 13% decrease in washing time as well as a 36% reduction in the number of lost customers due to waiting time in 
queues or dissatisfaction with the service, improving service efficiency and reducing reprocessing.

1. Introduction
There are 1.446 billion vehicles in the world today (Hedges & Company 2020). In the case of Peru, the vehicle fleet 
has grown exponentially in the last ten years. A clear example of this is that by 2010, the number of vehicles in the 
country was 1.8 million, and to date the number is close to 3 million. (Gobierno del Peru 2020). One of the services 
associated with automotive manufacturing and maintenance is car washing. This is constantly growing and along with 
it also increases the waste of drinking water, energy consumption, time, (Meng et al. 2020) and labor informality. It 
is known that, for every vehicle washed, 150 to 600 liters of water are used (Veit et al. 2020) depending on the size 
and type of washing: manual or automatic. Due to this problem, new ways arise based on the prioritization of water 
resources for human consumption and the use of technologies such as steam washing, automatic washing, dry cleaning 
with biopolymers, and disinfection of vehicles with ozone or quaternary ammonium, among others. (STEAMERICAS 
2022). These methods seek to generate efficiencies in washing process times and resource consumption in general. 
Currently, several problems affect the productivity of this business such as low standardization of its processes, lack 
of organization in the washing stations, and poor training of personnel, among others. (Medonos and Jurova 2020). 
All these challenges create the need to review and standardize processes to reduce the gap between manual and 
automated washing. In this case study, a Car Wash located in Santiago de Surco, Lima, Peru was analyzed, which has 
a low standardization in its processes, poor customer service and an average service level resulting in a decrease in its 
net profits and business margin. (Lamine 2018). To solve the mentioned problems, TQM and SLP tools will be applied, 
under the Lean methodology, counting on several success cases in similar sectors that allow it to show its success. 
(Anil 2019). In this way, the aim is to revalue and make the manual car wash service more effective to achieve 
significant improvements that translate into higher profits and efficiency in the use of resources. (Geca 2021). Finally, 
this article is divided into an introduction, literature review, methods, data collection, results and discussion, 
conclusions, and references.

Figure 9. Distribution plan of the improved washing stations 
 
Based on TQM, the improvement proposal was designed so that each workstation has a shelf with 9 divisions, where 
the implements to be used by the operator will be located; these divisions are organized according to the criteria of 
use. 
 
5.4 Validation 
Considering the improvement proposals, a simulation was modeled in the Arena program considering the scenario of 
all the washing services provided in the carwash. The case of the interior and exterior washing service of a car was 
specifically analyzed. A confidence level of 95% was used, a standard deviation of 4.18 and a margin of error of 0.05, 
which is detailed in Figure 10. The transfer of the vehicle to the dryer area was eliminated, considerably reducing the 
mobilization time of the operator. Likewise, travel times were reduced, obtaining an average time of 27.59 minutes 
after performing 150 replications in the simulation, reducing the gap to 2.59 minutes. Records were added for the 
analysis of KPIs, resulting in Table 5.

6. Conclusion 
The simulation of the proposed model resulted in an 11% improvement in station productivity associated with 
increases in station capacity, reduction of transfer times, downtime, and elimination of non-value-added activities. 
This is accompanied by a 36% decrease in the number of customers lost due to long waiting times in queues or

dissatisfied customers. As for the service gap, according to the model, a reduction of 61% was obtained, meaning this 
is ideally close to the gap time proposed at the beginning of the research. As for service efficiency, the new simulated 
efficiency indicator resulted in 89.64%, which represents an increase of 16% concerning the current indicator. Finally, 
we concluded that the main significant changes in the improvement of the gap were to eliminate vehicle transfers 
between stations and to decrease transfer times within the station due to a better distribution of space thanks to the 
SLP and TQM developed.

Abstract 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is an approach that is widely recognised as useful for improving operational performance. 
Despite this recognition, it is difficult to implement and failures are common. It is necessary to understand the key 
factors that are critical to the successful LSS implementation. These factors are often referred to as Critical Success 
Factors (CSFs).  Despite being a consolidated research area, recent reviews lack comprehensive exploration of LSS 
CSFs. This paper aims to present a comprehensive and critical review of this research area evolution, identifying the 
main CSFs and the relationships between them, the topics being researched in this field, and research gaps. A 
Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was used to develop this article. The results show that the published documents 
have been increasing in the domain, but impact have been decreasing. The review identified the ten most relevant 
CSFs. The most relevant factors is management commitment, which drive others. The CSFs were identified in micro, 
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), in service organisations, used for assessment tools, LSS leadership, and used 
as an integrated approach in Industry 4.0. The latter is an emerging issue that requires more research. This article 
presents evidence that LSS CSFs are acknowledged and vary little from organisation to organisation. Additional 
empirical research is needed to validate whether the identified CSFs are the most relevant in real settings.

1. Introduction
Continuous improvement (CI) is a culture of sustained improvement to eliminate waste in all organisation's systems 
and processes, involving joint improvement work. It does not necessarily require large capital investment (Bhuiyan 
and Baghel 2005). The implementation of a robust CI strategy is essential for an organisation to achieve the necessary 
flexibility, quality, responsiveness, adaptability, performance and to reduce variation and defect (Kaye and Anderson 
1999; McLean et al. 2017; Swarnakar et al. 2019). LSS is a CI approach that became an essential element for 
improving process performance (Antony et al. 2023). 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) integrates Lean and Six Sigma approaches for CI into a single combined approach.  Lean, 
characterised by its multifaceted system encompassing various management practices including just-in-time (JIT), 
quality management systems, and cellular manufacturing, synergistically generates a high-quality system that aligns

Abstract 
Recently, various advanced 3D scanners have been widely used in manufacturing industries to collect 3D point cloud 
data of fabricated artifacts. The extra dimension of 3D point cloud data can provide more detailed descriptions of 
anomalies in artifact surfaces than 2D image data. 3D point cloud data can be categorized into structured and 
unstructured point clouds. Compared with structured 3D point cloud data, unstructured point cloud data can capture 
the surface geometry more completely. However, anomaly detection and classification by using unstructured 3D point 
cloud data is more challenging due to unstructured data representation, inconsistent point sizes, and high 
dimensionality. To deal with these challenges, this talk will present some recent advances in machine learning for 
anomaly detection and classification by using unstructured 3D point cloud data. The accuracy and robustness of the 
proposed method are validated by simulation studies and case studies.

Abstract 
Many studies developed strategies for circularity implementation in the construction and building industry (CBI) by 
prioritising and analysing circular economy (CE) barriers or enablers or both barriers and enablers of CE for CBI. 
This study developed strategies for circularity implementation in construction procurement with priority information 
obtained for enablers, barriers, practices, and outcomes (EBPOs) of circular construction procurement (CCP) using 
the fuzzy best worst method (FBWM). This is a novel approach to analysing EBPOs, i.e., all four EBPOs are 
considered together. From past literature collected CCP EBPOs. Important observations made from collected EBPOs 
are that EBPOs are interconnected and influenced by each other. Enablers and barriers of CCP, influencing practices 
of CCP undertaken by organisations to employ circularity in construction procurement. These employed practices and 
functions are forces to deploy circularity outcomes. A three-step methodology is used to incorporate priority 
information on EBPOs. 1. Using the fuzzy Delphi method, shortlisted the potential thirty-three EBPOs from the 
collected total of sixty-nine EBPOs from the literature. 2. Using FBWM, developed priority information of EBPOs. 
Based on FBWM’s priority information, considered top important EBPOs and considered for 3rd step of methodology, 
i.e., SWOT/TOWS analysis and in this step, developed strategies for CCP implementation. All CCP EBPOs analysed
in this study are connected to circularity opportunities to construction organisations in proximity and with a definitive
impact from a circularity perspective, such as eco-innovation, brand value, Industrial symbiosis, circular expertise,
etc. This work is helpful for both academicians and industry practitioners in making CCP decisions and for preparing
policies for circularity implementation through CCP.

Abstract 
The geopolitical position and expertise position Morocco as the top producer of passenger cars in Africa, ranking 25th 
globally in 2022 and 8th in terms of growth by 15%. This achievement deserves an in-depth analysis of the sector, 
both from a statistical perspective and in terms of integration of Operational Excellence (OpEx) philosophy. Many 
studies have confirmed that cultural values have a direct impact on the success of organizational strategies and 
managerial actions. Similarly, success in integrating OpEx practices requires more than just using its toolbox. 
Although many organizations worldwide implement OpEx practices, the dimensions of national culture and leadership 
can significantly influence the expected outcomes. Based on theoretical and practical knowledge of leadership and 
cultural data, this research presents the results of an exploratory study on the moderation of leadership effectiveness 
by dimensions of national cultural values. The study focused on evaluating Leadership practices and national culture 
within all Moroccan automotive companies. A questionnaire was developed, validated, and distributed to 264 
individuals in various managerial positions, with a response rate of 81%. The results of this study will be used to 
identify perspectives for developing an effective OpEx model tailored to the Moroccan socio-cultural context. Until 
now, no large-scale study has examined the adoption and integration of the OpEx approach within Moroccan 
automotive companies. This study makes a significant contribution to academics, practitioners of the OpEx 
philosophy, and researchers dedicated to performance optimization.

1. Introduction
In the early 1980s, the concept of excellence made a discreet entrance into the industrial milieu amid economic crisis 
and concerns about Japan's performance. In 1982, Thomas Peters and Robert Waterman (1982) published a work 
titled ""In Search of Excellence,"" an American bestseller celebrating the cult of performance, translated into French as 
""Le Prix de l'Excellence"" (The Price of Excellence). As consultants for McKinsey, based on a survey of forty-three 
major companies, Peters and Waterman defined excellence as an efficiency horizon founded on eight normative 
principles. These principles aimed to distance organizations from Taylorism and Fordism, with their method 
promoting initiative, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit seen as essential for the success and excellence of any 
organization.

3.3 The impact of national culture and leadership on the maturity of OpEx. 
The study results highlight that the cultural aspect is considered one of the risk factors for the success of lean practices 
(see Figure 4), as indicated by 27% of the participating companies, which constitute the majority of the Moroccan 
automotive sector. Culture serves as the invisible bond that unites members of a community. When it comes to 
improvements, companies should transform into a cultural framework where everyone is involved. The trait of the 
involvement culture comprises three main indicators that differentiate it from other cultural traits; these indicators 
include empowerment, team orientation, and capacity development. 
 
Secondly, the pursuit of quick gains is identified by 25%, aligning with the perception of Operational Excellence, 
where participating companies indicated that the goal is to increase productivity.

4. Conclusion  
For these reasons and others, the Moroccan automotive industry remains aligned with the global automotive industry's 
evolution, demonstrating significant development qualities. In other words, it has a clear automotive strategy and a 
structured ecosystem of suppliers that has proven to be highly effective both locally and in export markets. 
 
In 2023, the first Moroccan automaker emerged with the introduction of the first 100% Moroccan car brand, NEO. 
The company, Neo Motors, with Moroccan capital, established an industrial unit in Ain Aouda (in the Rabat-Salé-
Kénitra region) to manufacture automobiles for the local and export markets, with a projected annual capacity of 
27,000 units and a local integration rate of 65%. According to its founder, Nassim Belkhayat, the company's CEO, the 
company aims for an annual production of 15,000 vehicles within three years, along with the introduction of new 
electric models. 
 
Finally, the findings of the study underscore the crucial role of tool training in the effective implementation of 
Operational Excellence, as acknowledged by nearly all companies. The next three key success factors identified 
include training in change management, awareness sessions, and effective communication of vision and strategy. 
Conversely, the study results highlight those cultural aspects, the pursuit of quick gains, and the absence of a 
sustainability method stand out as the primary risk factors for the successful adoption of this concept.

Abstract 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for processing image data in various applications, including logistics 
systems, production, etc. This research proposes a method for optimizing the structure of CNN. Many CNN models 
already use various structures, but there is no certain well-known framework for designing high-accuracy CNN models 
yet. Unlike previous studies, this study identifies combinations of various types and number of layers in CNN. 
Considering a limited number of alternative layer combinations when designing CNN models would reduce the 
computation time of the model generation (and increase the performance of the CNN model because it can consider 
more design alternatives during the model generation phase, given the available time). This study (1) extracts the 
combination of layers from many state-of-the-art CNN models that ensure the best information is obtained and (2) 
proposes a module-based framework to optimize the CNN structure. The numerical experiment shows that the 
proposed framework produces better accuracy than the compared best-known models. This research will provide 
insights on good combinations of layers and help researchers develop new CNN structures with high accuracy.

and reported the best parameter values and relationships between layers. A module-based framework for optimizing the 
CNN structure was proposed. The framework includes the exploitation and exploration techniques that introduce and 
test various CNN structures during the optimization process. 
 
The limitation of this study is the consideration of only one epoch during the algorithm run. It would affect the 
robustness of the obtained solutions and needs to be resolved, e.g., by increasing the number of epochs. Even though 
this study proposed a novel way to extract important information about the layers from various studies, another 
drawback of this study is the limited number of considered studies. Also, the search should be improved to allow 
increasing the accuracy of the final structure. More layer types could be considered as well to allow proposing CNN 
models with better accuracy.

Abstract 
The need for data is growing at an extremely steep rate in the ever-digital realm, where terms like ""big data"" are 
becoming a thing of the past. All this development requires the use of modern and advanced data handling techniques, 
where users and researchers can analyze and predict vast amounts of data efficiently. Data warehouses are centralized 
repositories of data used for business intelligence activities such as analysis and reporting. In this paper, a comparative 
emphasis has been laid down on two different types of data warehouses, on-premises, and cloud data warehouses. The 
on-premises are known to be physically housed inside an organization's infrastructure. Cloud data warehouses are 
online-accessible repositories for data that is stored on cloud platforms. This paper provides a comparative analysis 
of both types in the context of deployment, scalability, flexibility, query management, cost analysis, access and 
integration, data security, data storage, data recovery, self-service capabilities and nonetheless, speed and 
performance. This article further highlights the evolution of data warehouses onto cloud and accentuates the growing 
demand for an efficient data warehouse, due to the amplification of volume, velocity, variety, value, and veracity of 
the incoming data in all realms. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth analysis of the advantages of the most suitable 
data warehouse and discusses the limitations of both.

1. Introduction
The concept of data warehousing dates to the 1970s, when various organizations, businesses, and enterprises started 
pondering the importance of handling, storing, and managing the growing amount of data. To address these arising 
problems, the father of data warehouse, also known as Bill Inmon, introduced the term “data warehouse” in the late 
1991","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Many service providers have started delivering cloud services whether they may be needed to host a data warehouse 
platform, to set up a cloud database, or to enhance the performance of the already hosted data warehouse on the cloud. 
Services such as Oracle or Amazon web services have been implemented by users due to their agile functionality.   
The Amazon web services (AWS) provides its users with economical and cost-effective approaches to deploy and 
host their data warehouses on the cloud. AWS provides the world of business intelligence with cost-effective data 
lakes that are used to perform complex queries on petabytes of structured as well as semi-structured data such that the 
result can reproduce highly efficient reports and dashboards. Moreover, AWS provides access to computing SQL and 
analytical queries on various data types in the warehouse and data lakes without the requirement of relocating the data. 
Lastly, AWS is highly recognized for its efficient automation of setting and managing the data lakes for its users, thus 
reducing the workload of months into days.  
 
Similarly, the Oracle cloud-based solution also provides users with inimitable features. Oracle solutions have been 
divided into three prime components, improved agility, cost-effective approach, and co-location features. As for 
agility, the data in Oracle cloud solutions can be moved efficiently. Furthermore, Oracle’s cloud services provide data 
security at default, thus reducing the cost to a great extent. It has further been stated that the business world has been 
significantly transforming their applications onto Oracle Cloud Solutions, all due to the time available data.   
 
There are further several reasons why the provision of Oracle data warehouse cloud services should be implemented. 
The unique functionality of Oracle to innovate on hardware and software has led to a much faster approach to 
deploying a data warehouse on Oracle than any other service provider as Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Secondly, the Oracle 
solution is known for its big data enablement. As the demand and recommendation of implementing a hybrid platform 
for the extraction of data is escalating rapidly. To cater for this, Oracle provides customers with cloud services that 
enable the creation of hybrid platforms, alongside it offers an inferior option of leveraging Hadoop as the engine for 
new data sources. Thirdly, Oracle is known for its capabilities of maintaining a data warehouse in the cloud which 
ultimately leads to ease of distributing the data and maintaining a geographically disbursed system (Oracle 2021).  
 
5. Conclusion  
Precisely, the world is in an endless race towards the best-suited approach for big data, business analytics, intelligence, 
and so on. Studies are consistently providing seamless approaches to handling the vast amount of data and are 
persuading the business community to shift from traditional methodologies to cloud data warehouses. Similarly, this 
paper has used an approach of thoroughly comparing the on-premises data warehouse and cloud data warehouse. The 
paper has reviewed the alternatives through a certain set of parameters and summarized the stances in a table. The 
modernization of the data warehouses has eventually paved the path to cloud strategy. Nonetheless, the case studies, 
the comparisons, and the optimization approaches tested on cloud data warehouses as compared to traditional data 
warehouses have certainly given an upper hand to cloud solutions. To further elucidate the dilemma between the data 
warehouse approaches services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, Cloudera, Snowflake, Teradata, 
Apache Hive, and Microsoft Azure are growing their customers rapidly.  It may be stated that the on-premises data 
warehouse provides its users with a greater sense of data security, however, the services that the cloud has been 
offering nullify the capabilities of an on-premises data warehouse. The functionalities of the cloud such as pay-as-
you-go service, scalability, flexibility, backup services and cost-effectiveness have led the world with a very clear 
motive for what has to be the future of data warehouses.  Thus, business intelligence is meticulously delving into the 
capacity of cloud data warehouses and making the required shift towards it. Henceforth, it can be stated that between 
these two alternates, the cloud data warehouse is mounting the cliff of the data warehouse future with immensely 
densified services.

Abstract 
In our capstone design project, we present a cost-effective Air-to-Ground (A2G) system and network design that 
would consequently contribute into vitalizing domestic tourism in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The advancement of 
5G technology has created opportunities to enhance inflight connectivity (IFC) services, enabling passengers to stay 
connected and engaged during their flights. However, deploying such systems can be challenging in terms of cost and 
infrastructure requirements. Accordingly, we propose a cost-effective A2G system and network design capable of 
providing 5G-grade IFC for domestic flights taking advantage of the unique landscape properties of the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia. Our design incorporates the use of existing terrestrial base stations (TBSs) strategically deployed to 
cover the domestic flight corridors, ensuring seamless connectivity for passengers onboard. We also consider the 
optimization of network resources when utilizing 5G technology to provide high-speed and reliable inflight 
connectivity while striking a balance between the objective of reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) and that of 
delivering a 5G-grade inflight connectivity. We formulate an optimization model to address the issue of selecting a 
subset of the already deployed TBSs infrastructure, specifically those that overlap with the corridors of domestic 
flights, to be reutilized after being upgraded with up-tilted 5G-NR antennas. Using MATLAB, we conducted a grid 
partition analysis on the landscape of Saudi Arabia to gain a comprehensive understanding of the region allowing us 
to visualize their attributes across the country. Consequently, we associated each grid point with the factors influencing 
the TCO for the A2G network infrastructure. These factors include considerations such as geographical conditions, 
population density, and proximity to existing infrastructure among other relevant parameters. By incorporating these 
factors, we were able to assess the TCO implications at each grid point. Hence, our approach facilitates the 
identification of the most favourable sites for the placement of A2G TBSs and thus optimize the efficiency and cost-
effectiveness of our network deployment, ensuring reliable 5G-grade IFC across Saudi Arabia. Through performance 
evaluations and cost analysis, we demonstrate the viability and cost-effectiveness of our proposed A2G system and 
network design. This research contributes to the fields of systems engineering and operations management by 
providing a practical and efficient solution for deploying and managing the A2G network systems, considering the 
capital and operational costs involved and the resource optimization required for providing seamless 5G-grade IFC in 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Abstract 
Urban areas globally face escalating challenges from Urban Heat Islands (UHI), characterized by elevated 
temperatures in urban regions compared to surrounding areas. This paper addresses the urgent need for comprehensive 
UHI analysis and mitigation strategies by harnessing advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision 
techniques. The primary objectives encompass leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery and semantic segmentation 
algorithms for accurate UHI detection through detailed land cover classification. Additionally, the study integrates 
weather information application programming interfaces (APIs) to correlate real-time and historical weather data with 
UHI intensity, providing a holistic understanding of UHI effects. Our proposed methodology involves a twofold 
architectural design, comprising the preprocessing of satellite images using patchify-ing and semantic segmentation 
for land cover classification. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to differentiate between urban and 
rural areas, showcasing its potential for automated UHI detection. The research emphasizes the importance of 
acquiring ample satellite data to enhance accuracy and resolution, acknowledging current limitations in the available 
dataset. In conclusion, this paper underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to UHI, combining AI and Computer 
Vision for precise detection and comprehensive analysis. While presenting a case study for a single city, the outlined 
pipeline provides essential steps for detecting UHI effects in any area equipped with necessary satellite imagery and 
temperature data, contributing to the broader understanding and mitigation of UHI in urban environments.

1. Introduction
The ongoing growth and development of urban areas have presented societies with unprecedented opportunities for 
economic growth but have also given rise to a range of environmental challenges. Among these challenges, the 
phenomenon of Urban Heat Islands has emerged as an urgent concern, demanding extensive attention for detecting 
the phenomenon and innovative approaches to mitigate it. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect can be defined as the 
increase of temperature in urban areas, compared to surrounding rural or suburban areas. 
Globally, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to understanding and quantifying microclimates at the local 
level, often with the objective of offering design recommendations to enhance the overall quality of urban

Table 3: Temperature acquired through the API at the center of each section as of July 2023. The rural area has a 
considerably lower temperature compared to the urban area. 
 
 
 
 
 
Afterwards, 
the 
temperature can be processed from the API for both locations for a specific date (in this case, July 2023). It is also 
possible to summarize the historical data over a period of 40 years (1983 - 2023) with the paid version of the API, in 
steps of 5 years. The data is tabulated in Table 3. 
 
The temperature data acquired clearly indicates a rise of temperature in the urban city compared to the rural area, 
heavily implying signs of the UHI in this city.  
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
It is possible to further improve the results of this research by acquiring a large number of satellite data for cities, to 
accurately choose the rural and urban patches for comparison. Currently, this research is limited by the amount of 
satellite images available, and their resolution which heavily impacts the performance of the segmentation model. 
Additionally, the segmentation model is very sensitive to the label provided to differentiate between urban or rural 
patches. This requires tweaking the label provided until a suitable mask is generated, however, the labels provided in 
this paper worked on multiple patches in this case study. Finally, comparing results between the current year and 
historical data can further indicate the seriousness of the UHI effect for a city, although this requires a paid subscription 
to the weather API. This paper focused on open-source resources, and this part was not possible to implement. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Addressing Urban Heat Islands (UHI) demands a holistic approach integrating AI and Computer Vision. First 
requiring the utilization of high-resolution satellite imagery and semantic segmentation for precise UHI detection 
through land cover classification. Then, integrating weather data from APIs to correlate real-time and historical 
weather data with UHI intensity. 
 
There are many solutions to mitigate the effects of UHI, however, it is still a tiring task to fully prove the existence of 
the phenomenon within many cities in the world. This paper provides a case study for a single city, put outlines the 
necessity steps in a pipeline to detect the UHI effect in any area provided with the necessary satellite imagery and 
temperature data.

Abstract 
The rise of e-commerce, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has transformed the way we shop and receive 
shipments. This shift, expected to reach $378 billion by 2025 in the USA, has led to increased online retail sales but 
also posed challenges in last-mile delivery. Addressing issues such as theft, inefficiency, and environmental impact, 
innovative solutions like smart parcel boxes have emerged. These solutions leverage technologies like AI and IoT to 
offer secure, 24/7 access, optimizing the delivery process and contributing to a more sustainable future. Problem 
statement: Shipment recipients in Saudi Arabia encounter various challenges regarding their orders. The traditional 
practice of meeting the delivery driver to receive shipments has become inefficient in today's dynamic world. To dive 
into the current process of delivering shipments we could see that multiple steps need to be removed or optimized at 
least. Motivation: The logistics sector in Saudi Arabia is focused on enhancing global connectivity and reducing 
transportation costs, contributing to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor. Recognizing the need for 
innovation in shipment receiving methods, there is a commitment to actively participate in transformative changes 
within logistics and transportation. Conclusion:Smart parcels provide customers with the convenience of managing 
their shipments efficiently and reliably, which contributes to reducing financial costs and shortening delivery time. 
Future steps: Add a sensor to confirm the delivery., Add solar panels., Add a camera for security.

1. Introduction
In the last decade, the volume of data has grown at an unprecedented rate (Qi 2020). According to an International 
Data Corporation (IDC) report, the digital universe would double every two years (Agrawal 2020, Lian, Zhang et al. 
2020). This explosive growth in data generation has created a need for smart technologies to analyze this massive, 
fuzzy, and noisy data. Data mining (DM) is the process that can meet this need and extract useful information from 
data by providing algorithms, models, and sophisticated data analysis tools and techniques. This process is generally 
known as ""knowledge mining from data"". DM is an important process for finding meaningful new correlations, 
interesting patterns, interdependencies, and trends by sifting through huge data stored in data warehouses and 
databases (Han, Pei et al. 2011, Larose and Larose 2014). DM has a multidisciplinary nature and is influenced by 
machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, database and data warehouse systems, and other disciplines such as 
pattern recognition, information retrieval, visualization, algorithms, and high-performance computing (Han, Pei et al. 
2011). According to the kind of knowledge extracted, different types of functions can be defined, such as classification,

Abstract  
The objective of this article is to examine the structure of the formation of entrepreneurial competencies required by 
university students to support the needs of Colombian SMEs in achieving competitive advantages, from the 
perspectives of academia and the business sector. To this end, experts in teaching, consulting, and human resources 
management were consulted to give their rating of 27 competencies. This study used a cross-sectional survey research 
design, with primary data sources collected through a structured questionnaire specific to the university context. A 
survey tool was designed to investigate and define the most relevant entrepreneurial competencies between the two 
analysis groups. The study revealed a group of entrepreneurial competencies that, if properly trained, can lead to the 
construction of competitive advantages in the company, according to the group of experts consulted. In addition, the 
study concluded that certain specific skill groups (personal and operational training in the company) are more effective 
in business training. Finally, learning should seek expertise and joint and synergistic activities to improve training and 
pedagogical processes in relation to these two approaches. Therefore, the results suggest that university institutions 
should focus on developing specific entrepreneurial competencies and pedagogical methodologies in university 
students to facilitate the promotion of entrepreneurship, considering student conditions and the business context.

1. Introduction
As the world moves into the era of globalization and digitalization, entrepreneurial skills from being desirable virtues 
have become important characteristics for strategy planning within organizations. The ability to identify opportunities, 
manage risks, and foster creativity are examples of competencies used as drivers of business growth. In the same way, 
effective leadership, informed decision-making, and orientation to quality results with quality, among others, are 
competencies that converge to cultivate the path towards competitiveness and excellence in the company. These 
constant changes that companies face imply that achieving success requires the skills, knowledge, and attitudes of 
individuals in their contributions.    
The sum of entrepreneurial and business skills makes it easier for the idea, initiative, and spirit of entrepreneurship to 
be transformed into authentic companies and projects that generate value. Different authors affirm that the study of 
entrepreneurship has an important component for its improvement and that is the study of the development of 
individual competencies (Batista-Canino et al. 2024). This approach has been proposed by several education 
researchers (Ferreras-Garcia et al. 2021; Reis et al. 2021; Tittel and Terzidis 2020). The aim is to move from an 
entrepreneurial intention to an entrepreneurial behavior supported by the development of business skills (Batista-

Abstract 
The objective of this article is to present the results of the implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) 
technology in the operational collection processes of an agency specializing in the recovery of overdue accounts 
receivable, to highlight the benefits for the company and its customers. The type of research was experimental through 
a multifactorial design that based on Hernandez and Fernandez (2014) manipulated more than one independent 
variable. The research was conducted in two phases: 1. Review and analysis of available technologies for the 
development of RPAs and 2. the implementation of operational processes. The result was that the use of digital robots 
significantly reduces the processing and sending of invoices to debtors, resulting in a lower financial impact to 
customers because they collect invoices 15 days faster, allowing them to have more working capital, as well as 
improving business relationships with customers. In this way, this research lays the foundations of proven and tested 
information technologies to increase profitability and operational efficiency in companies, and a proportion of the 
budget is allocated to innovation and development (i+D) or digital transformation so that the technological gap existing 
in companies in Mexico can be drastically reduced.

1. Introduction
The sanitary confinement due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus had a relevant social and mainly economic impact, causing 
macroeconomic changes on a worldwide scale, and affecting all economic sectors, as well as all types of businesses. 
The supply of goods and services was strongly affected, causing a clear reduction in demand. This historical event 
caused the economy of many companies to deteriorate, considering quantitative and qualitative effects, which are 
reflected in the financial information, considering the accounting and tax regulations, to mention a few, leading to the 
fact that companies found themselves with Accounts Receivable that eventually became Uncollectible Accounts, in 
essence, those whose recovery became impossible due to their complexity (Becerra et al., 2021). 
The operational continuity of companies depends crucially on the availability of liquidity. One of the most significant 
paradoxes in organizations is the discrepancy between excellent sales volume and inefficient collection management 
(Gómez, 2007), which leads to severe problems in cash flow management.

Figure 7. Customer Satisfaction Score 
 
The results were very positive for the collection agency, 73% of customers would recommend it to their colleagues, 
the response time of attention is excellent with 92%, the corporate image is in high standards due to public acceptance 
with an imposing 95%, and in terms of technology stands out with 83%, the hypothesis is that by implementing digital 
robot technology reached 90%, customers in the pharmaceutical industry are satisfied with the service at 90%. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Robotic process automation significantly simplifies monotonous and repetitive tasks in various industries, allowing 
people's time to be focused on higher-value activities such as strategy, and analysis and even providing more efficient 
customer service. 
 
Collections management emerges as a critical area for all organizations, as non-compliance with collection time can 
lead to serious financial problems. In such cases, companies often resort to applying for lines of credit, which involves 
the payment of high interest and fees, negatively impacting the companies' profitability or, in the worst-case scenario, 
leading to the company's bankruptcy. This study highlights that, before the implementation of RPAs, companies 
managed their collections every 88 days. Subsequently, thanks to the intervention of the bots, a successful remittance 
of 98% of the invoicing volume was achieved, reducing the collection period to every 30 days and obtaining a net 
recovery of 85%, compared to the initial 49%. 
 
In the specific case of this Mexican company, the implementation of automation not only represented a significant 
improvement in the process of sending invoices to debtors but also marked the birth of a new product that is now 
offered to other companies in sectors such as logistics, food, and beverages, among others.

Abstract 
The use of technology in one of the Vannamei shrimp ponds in Purworejo, Central Java is still done traditionally. One 
of the difficulties in pond management is the difficulty of dealing with waste problems. They used a protein skimmer, 
but it was deemed less effective due to the 24-hour consumptive use of electricity and inadequate pump capacity. The 
aim of this research is to find the best and most efficient way to use a protein skimmer. The design method used in this 
research is the Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) method to analyze the level of risk in shrimp farming supply 
chain management, the fishbone diagram and p-chart method for operations management, the Verein Deutscher 
Ingeniure (VDI) 2222 method to determine the design technical drawings, and using the Break Event Point (BEP) 
method for processing engineering economic data. After implementing the method and designing the protein skimmer 
tool, pH parameter testing, timer automation, use of a water wheel and shrimp condition will be carried out. Based on 
the research results, it can be seen that the design of the protein skimmer tool with the addition of pH checker 
automation and timer automation, as well as the use of a water wheel can be implemented well because it can produce 
a water pH suitable for shrimp survival, and has met the investment target of no more than IDR 1,287,000, and can 
charge 123 watts/5 hours. In this design, it is recommended to design a simpler tool, pay more attention to accuracy in 
measurements and calculations, and consider the placement of the battery so that it does not experience a short circuit. 
Apart from that, when testing the protein skimmer tool, it is necessary to redesign the microbuble storage area to be 
wider and separate from the main pipe.

Abstract 
Antalya, one of the most important cities in tourism, boasts numerous hotels. One of the significant challenges faced 
by group hotels with all-inclusive concepts among these establishments is the process of washing dirty laundry 
resulting from hotel operations. This project is being conducted in a group company that owns hotels in various regions 
of Antalya. Initially, one hotel was selected as a pilot hotel, and later, other hotels will be included in the process. The 
aim of this project is to decide whether the laundry washing operation should be carried out within the facility or 
through outsourcing for more efficient execution. The laundry of the selected facility is located on-site and is used to 
wash towels, blankets, and uniforms. Meanwhile, sheets, bed linens, tablecloths, napkins, and pillowcases are washed 
through external service procurement.  
There are essentially two stages in this project: 
i.
Determination of the Current Situation:
•
Identification of existing capacity
•
Staff numbers
•
Laundry area size
•
Costs
ii.
Analysis of the Possibility of Conducting Outsourced Services Within the Facility:
•
Determination of necessary capacity (machinery, equipment, personnel, etc.)
•
Shift work
•
Required laundry area size
In the first stage, existing equipment, staff numbers, and laundry area size were identified. The operational status of 
machines was analyzed, and business and time studies were conducted on processes. Additionally, costs such as 
electricity, water,  machine breakdowns, etc., for the washing operation were determined. In the second stage, research 
will be conducted to determine the necessary resources if the processes conducted through outsourcing are to be 
performed within the facility. A decision will be made on which option is more advantageous. Upon the completion

Abstract 
This study will investigate the analysis of the supplier selection problem faced by a group company that owns hotels 
in various regions of Antalya in its fresh vegetable and fruit purchasing process for all hotels that are under the group 
company. The company currently faces a decision between continuing with its existing supplier, negotiating a new 
contract, purchasing directly from the market, or exploring alternatives with new suppliers. The analysis will 
meticulously scrutinize price differentials and logistic costs, conduct a thorough examination of negotiation potential 
with suppliers, and consider quality factors and potential disruptions. In facilitating decision-making, a proposed 
mathematical model and scenario analysis comprehensively integrate various factors, underscoring the imperative for 
precise analysis and negotiation to establish a cost-effective and dependable supply chain.

Abstract 
In the domain of human resources, the factors that encourage employees to transition to a specific sector are commonly 
known as ""job incentives"" or ""career incentives."" These encompass elements such as competitive salaries, appealing 
benefits packages, prospects for career progression, professional development initiatives, a positive work atmosphere, 
and meaningful tasks aligned with an employee's values and objectives.  
Saudi Arabia, in its ambitious 2030 Vision, aims to raise the nonprofit sector's contribution to the GDP from 3% to 
5%. A key focus for achieving this goal is the religious tourism sector. This paper scrutinizes the incentives within the 
nonprofit realm, specifically within the religious tourism sector. To pinpoint the necessary incentives for attracting 
highly skilled personnel, a survey was conducted using Gallup's Employee Engagement Survey. Additionally, exit 
interviews were analyzed to comprehend the reasons behind employees leaving the sector. 
The findings revealed that certain factors significantly influence employee turnover. Addressing these factors expected 
to enhance employee retention and increase the sector's overall appeal. These factors include, among others, the work 
environment, job security, opportunities for career growth, and the perception of nonprofit sector employees. Study 
has shown the important challenges faced by the non-profit sector organizations and pointed out some valuable 
incentives needed for the organizations to help and guide the stakeholders for developing a more conducive work 
environment to provide best possible services to the pilgrims at holy places.

1. Introduction:
The non-profit sector encompasses a diverse range of organizations dedicated to social good, cultural preservation, 
and religious service. While traditional career paths often prioritize financial compensation, the non-profit world offers 
distinct incentives that go beyond monetary rewards. This research delves into the specific case of the non-profit 
religious tourism sector in Saudi Arabia, a rapidly expanding non-profit industry driven by the Kingdom's Vision 2030 
and its commitment to welcoming pilgrims and visitors for performing the religious rituals at the holy city of Makkah 
and Madinah. This paper explores the unique career incentives that attract and retain talent in this non-profit religious 
tourism sector, drawing on the experiences of industry professionals and relevant literature. 
The non-profit sector offers a unique and rewarding career path for individuals who are passionate about making a 
positive impact on the world. In Saudi Arabia, the non-profit religious tourism sector is a particularly dynamic and 
growing area, offering a variety of career opportunities with distinct incentives. Contributing to the growth and 
development of the non-profit religious tourism industry in Saudi Arabia directly translates to serving the needs of

Abstract 
Globally, road traffic accidents pose a significant and pressing issue, resulting in numerous fatalities and injuries. In 
the Philippines, the escalating rates of road-related deaths and accidents underscore the critical need to comprehend 
the factors influencing safe driving behavior, particularly among Filipino private car drivers. This research explores 
the determinants impacting perceived safe driving behaviors, employing the framework of the Protection Motivation 
Theory and the Three Broad Domains of Ergonomics framework. Utilizing a survey questionnaire and structural 
equation modeling (SEM), the study seeks to uncover the intricate correlation between driving experience, 
geographical perception, level of understanding, perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, physical ergonomics, 
cognitive ergonomics, macro ergonomics, and perceived safe driving. The study garnered responses from 510 
respondents through a digital survey questionnaire using a convenience sampling method. The results show that the 
latent variables driving experience, geographical perception, level of understanding, perceived severity, perceived 
vulnerability, physical ergonomics, and cognitive ergonomics were identified as factors that have a significant impact 
on the perceived safe driving behavior of Filipino Private car drivers. Among these latent variables, perceived 
vulnerability is the most crucial factor in perceived safe driving behavior, with a p-value of 0.006. However, macro 
ergonomics shows an insignificant effect on Filipino private car drivers’ perceived safe driving behavior. The study 
provides insights into the factors influencing perceived safe driving behavior among Filipino private car drivers. The 
findings can be used to develop interventions and policies to improve road safety in the Philippines.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Rationale
Traffic accidents are unexpected and unintentional events that occur on roadways, involving individuals using the
roads and resulting in property damage, injuries, and fatalities. Annually, road-related accidents contribute to about
1.35 million documented fatalities and at least 20 million cases of minor injuries (WHO 2022). This issue ranks as the
tenth-leading cause of death globally, making it a matter of significant concern (WHO 2018).
Shinar (2017) emphasized that 95% of road accidents are attributed to driver behavior and human factors, establishing 
them as the most critical elements in accident occurrences. In the Philippines, it has been discussed that human error 
is responsible for 8 out of 10 road accidents nationwide, ranking it among the leading causes of such incidents (MMDA 
2022). Despite the government’s implementation of traffic rules and regulations to instill discipline among drivers and

6. Conclusion  
The Philippines is one of the countries with an increasing trend of vehicular accidents caused by human/driver errors. 
Studies have shown that despite implementing measures such as traffic law enforcement, road safety education, and 
training requirements, the number of road accidents caused by human error and driving mistakes continues to rise 
(Publico 2022; Tucay 2016; MMARAS 2019). Through the integration of PMT and the Three Broad Domains of 
Ergonomics, this study aimed to understand how these factors affect the perceived safe-driving behavior of Filipino 
private car drivers.. The variables considered are driving experience (D), geographical perception (GP), level of 
understanding (LU), perceived vulnerability (PV), perceived severity (PS), perceived safe driving (PD), physical 
ergonomics (PE), cognitive ergonomics (CE), and macro ergonomics (ME).  
 
The variables are evaluated through Structural Equation Modeling, where the results show that the latent variables 
driving experience, geographical perception, level of understanding, perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, 
physical ergonomics, and cognitive ergonomics were identified as factors that has a significant impact to the perceived 
safe driving behavior of Filipino Private car drivers. Among these latent variables, perceived vulnerability is 
determined to be the most significant factor to perceived safe driving behavior with a beta value of ß = 0.845 and p-
value of p = 0.006.  However, macroergonomics shows an insignificant effect on Filipino private car drivers' perceived 
safe driving behavior. Üzümcüoğlu, Y. 2020 stated that macro-ergonomic factors may not directly influence a driver’s 
perception of safety as it only contributes to the overall safety of the driving environment and has nothing to do with 
the driver’s specific driving behaviors.  
 
Given these results, the accepted hypotheses established are as follows: 
 
H1: Driver Experience has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. 
H2: Driver Experience has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. 
H3: Geographical Perception has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. 
H4: Geographical Perception has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers.H5: 
Level of understanding of Traffic Policies has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car 
drivers. 
H6: Level of understanding of Traffic Policies has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private 
car drivers. 
H7: Perceived Severity has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. 
H8: Perceived Vulnerability has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. 
H9: Physical Ergonomics has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. 
H10: Cognitive Ergonomics has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. 
 
The study highlighted perceived vulnerability as the most significant factor that affects the perceived safe driving 
behavior of Filipino private car drivers. This is evident as drivers who believe that they are less vulnerable will 
undoubtedly engage in unsafe driving behaviors (Hu et al. 2020).

Abstract 
Human error is a widely discussed subject in socio-technical systems, especially in large industries where it has a 
profound impact. Process and maritime industries rely primarily on human performance thus human error is a highly 
relevant. It influences the safety, financial outcomes, and operational efficiency of an industry. This study presents a 
critical literature review from 2013 to 2023 by examining how human error is perceived and characterized in these 
(process and maritime) domains. The study aims to uncover the complexities of this subject by investigating the 
commonalities and differences in human error within these industries. The methodology used to identify human error, 
its interpretation, and demographic factors like geography and orientation by discipline are analyzed to provide a 
complete holistic view. The definition of human error and the framework used across these 2 industries is also 
investigated in the literature. By relying on a decade's worth of research, this preliminary work shed light on the 
prevailing themes and methods for managing human error. The insights from this work lay a foundation for future 
research and the development of precise interventions to mitigate the impact of human error, advocating for a safer 
and more robust industrial operational environment. Some recommendations are also provided at the end based on 
this literature review.

Abstract 
This paper is on designs a green closed-loop supply chain network considering economic factors and environmental 
concerns and interconnected facilities. Over or under-achievement of forecasted supply, demand, and return, caused 
by the isolation of manufacturing and remanufacturing facilities (MRFs), can be compensated through lateral 
transshipment between MRFs. The decision variables are opening MRFs, environmental investment level for adopting 
clean technology in each MRF which is defined by linguistic variables, and the flow of products between nodes. 
Environmental investment and selection of transportation modes play important roles in the concerned objectives. A 
fuzzy multi-objective mathematical programming model is proposed for the problem under inherent uncertainty of 
supply, demand, returns, costs, capacities in the network, imprecise Co2 emission of transportation modes, and 
technology level. Solving two numerical examples shows the applicability of the model in the real world with the 
selected best technological level of MRFs and the reduction of costs and Co2 emission.

1. Introduction
The design of a closed-loop supply chain network is an important issue that involves the determination of both sites 
and levels of operation which include a network of supplier, manufacturer, and distribution centers in forward flow, 
collection and inspection, and disposal in reverse flow with efficiently considering the connection between them to 
customer satisfaction (Salehi-Amiri et al 2022). 
Environmental pollution should be addressed in supply chain management. Production activities and transport are the 
main sources of pollution and Co2 emission consequently causing global warming and harmful influences on the 
ecosystem and human health (Yu et al 2021, and Liu et al 2021). Designing a green supply chain network with proper 
transportation modes and environmental production technology can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
environmental pollution. Therefore, most countries have set strict plans to reduce their carbon emissions by change in 
the design of the supply chain network (Wang et al 2011). Also, green network design can strong brand image and 
consequently improve market share (Tseng et al 2019).

contrary, selecting a smaller value for ψ  is indicative of more focus for obtaining an answer with high satisfaction 
degree for some goals of the problem without giving special attention to satisfaction level of other objectives. The 
final solution therefore shall be a more non- balanced answer. It can be seen from the above table that as per lower 
values of ψ  no balance shall exist between satisfactions of the objectives. But by the increase in the above parameter 
value from 0.4 onwards the satisfaction of both objectives is effected with higher balance. 
In order to show the importance of transshipment between MRFs (lateral transfer) after the arrival of stock in each 
center by suppliers, we solve the second example under two different scenarios. Table 4 shows the fulfillment of both 
objectives under two scenarios.  
• 
First scenario: solving the example by considering the lateral transhipment of prosucts between 
manufacturing and re-manufacturing centers. 
• 
Second scenario: solving the example without considering lateral transhipment of prosucts between 
manufacturing and re-manufacturing centers. 
Best solution of objective 1: (Scenario 2) Z1=7336952, (Scenario 1) Z1=7158752, R1 = (scenario 1) Z1  - (Scenario 
2) Z1 =178200; 
Best solution of objective 2: (Scenario 2) Z2=5186702, (Scenario 1) Z2=5084204, R1 = (scenario 1) Z2  - (Scenario 2) 
Z2 =102500. 
 
It can be observed that by selecting identical technology levels for the MRFs in above scenarios, the value of both 
objectives in the first scenario (considering transshipment between the manufacturing and remanufacturing centers) is 
lower than the second scenario and because the problem in both objectives is of optimization type, the second scenario 
gives better answer both in terms of the expected cost minimization and greenness and minimization of carbon dioxide 
emission. Also due to the identical level of technology in both scenarios it can be argued that the lateral transshipment 
between MRFs in addition to encountering with uncertainty in supply and demand, reduces the pollution level resulting 
from the transportation in the network.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The issue of supply chain network design has been the focus of researchers in different ways. The various relationships 
between the main components of the supply chain network, the way of transportation between the components, the 
closed loop and attention to various social and environmental requirements are among the factors that have been 
mentioned in recent articles in this field. The problem of 5 echelons of the supply chain including suppliers, MRFs, 
customer zones, CIs, and disposal zones in which it is possible to return the product is the main issue studied in this 
article. This routine model, which has been previously discussed in various articles, can be examined from several 
aspects. First, what will be the transportation procedure between and within the echelons in terms of cost and pollution. 
Second, what is the level of technology chosen in MRFs in terms of cost and pollution. Thirdly, what pattern does the 
returned product from the customer return to the cycle? And fourth, whether there is a possibility of intra-echelon 
transfer. On the other hand, the uncertainty hidden in the parameters and limitations of the problem and the multi-
targeting of the problem are other main aspects of the articles related to this field. This paper studies the integration 
of transshipment in supply chain network design with multiple suppliers, multiple manufacturing and remanufacturing 
facilities, multiple customer zones, multiple collection and inspection centers and disposal centers, under an 
imprecise/fuzzy environment. As an aspect that was observed to be lacking in the literature, in this paper lateral 
transshipment between MRFs is considered. Transshipment policies might improve customer satisfaction and 
responsiveness to customer demand in closed-loop supply chain. In order to mitigating transportation capacity 
uncertainty, we applied multi-mode transportation system. Multi-mode transportation system leads to reduce total 
costs and Co2 emission as well. The proposed supply chain network design includes environmental consideration in 
both transportation process and environmental technology level of MRF. Subjective parameter based on linguistic 
variables is another important aspect for interacting decision making based on cost and environmental variables. In 
this paper a multi objective mixed integer programming model is proposed for minimizing total cost and 
environmental influence. Since most of the parameters in such a problem have imprecise nature, a possibilistic 
programming is applied to dealing with epistemic parameters i.e., cost, and environmental influence. To solve the 
proposed MOPMILP model, an interactive fuzzy solution approach is proposed by combining the Jimenez and TH 
methods. The proposed framework provides the efficient solutions based on decision maker preferences to incorporate 
their expertise as well as their historical knowledge regarding the system under study into the model in order to obtain 
an optimal production network. By defining the variable of quantity of product shipped from MRF j to MRF j´, the 
amount of lateral transshipment was considered in the model. Based on the obtained results, by adding this variable 
and its equivalent constraints, compared to the case where there is no lateral transportation, in average the amount of

the total cost of the model and the amount of reduction of CO2 emissions have decreased by 2.5% and 2%, 
respectively. This average value is obtained based on different levels of coefficients and the degree of weighting to 
the objectives in the TH method (which leads to the production of balanced and unbalanced responses) and the alpha 
coefficient in dephasing the model. The most important advantage of our article is the definition of different levels of 
environmental technology in the creation of MRF and the existence of literal transshipment. In this paper, some 
assumptions were considered in the original model, which can be developed in future papers. For example, 
differentiating the quality and demand for recovered products from the quality and demand for normal products can 
be an interesting aspect for future studies. Also, considering different land, rail and air routes for transportation and 
adding the issue of routing as well as location of MRFs are other aspects that can be added to the model.

Abstract 
The study aims to identify factors influencing Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in utilizing peer-to-
peer lending as an alternative business financing. The object of this research is Palembang City MSME players. This 
type of research is descriptive quantitative using primary data obtained through a questionnaire instrument to 90 
respondents. While the data analysis technique uses Structual Equation Model-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) with 
the help of SmartPLS 4.0 software. The results showed that the variables of Information Quality (IQ), Perceived Ease 
of Use (PEU), and Perceived Risk (PR) had a significant effect on Perceived Trust (PT). Meanwhile, the variables 
Perceived Risk (PR) and Perceived Trust (PT) have a significant effect on Decision (DEC). The managerial 
implications indicate that using peer-to-peer lending as an alternative financing can provide new benefits for MSMEs. 
However, users must consider several factors that will influence the decision to use peer-to-peer lending. One that 
must be understood is knowing valid information to make the right decision; the second is understanding the risks 
associated with using peer-to-peer lending, such as privacy and data security. Perceptions of convenience and trust 
explain that the greater the level of convenience felt by MSMEs in using peer-to-peer lending fintech, the greater the 
trust felt by MSMEs when using peer-to-peer lending.

The next strategy is the perception of a risk that users tend to avoid because it can be detrimental, this is what is felt 
by MSME users who make online loans through peer to peer lending. The impact that often arises in risk perception, 
namely data security and privacy, is often something that users fear in using online loans.  
 
Perceptions of convenience and perceptions of trust are things that are very influential on user decisions, because they 
have factors that are interconnected with each other. the perception of trust has the main foundation when building 
trust between lenders and borrowers which results in a sense of security, and mutual trust. If the borrower already 
feels comfortable with the lender, t h e borrower will continue to depend on his partner. The higher the image built by 
peer to peer lending, t h e more users' trust in making online loans through peer to peer lending will increase. 
Meanwhile, perceived convenience is someone who already believes that using a system can be easy to use and free 
from effort. Conversely, if someone believes that the information system cannot be easily used then he will not do it. 
Based on this, the greater the level of convenience felt by MSMEs in using peer to peer lending fintech, the greater 
the trust felt by MSMEs when using peer to peer lending. 
 
5.3 Research Limitations 
The limitations in this study are that no previous researchers have combined the analysis of peer to peer lending as an 
alternative funding for MSMEs with the TAM application and the lack of objects in this study. Therefore, future 
research can add other factors that are expected to influence peer to peer lending and involve MSME players to get a 
better understanding of peer to peer lending. 
 
5.4 Advice 
Suggestions for other studies that will investigate the same topic to add the number of respondents, expand the scope, 
and investigate other variables that can affect interest in use such as Perceived Usefulness (PU), security, and so on.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to test and analyze the effect of financial distress on tax avoidance mediated by transfer 
pricing in manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2020-2022. This study uses a 
descriptive method with a quantitative approach. The number of samples taken in this study was 48 companies. The 
sampling technique was carried out with a nonprobability sampling approach, namely the purpose sampling method. 
The findings of this study are transfer pricing is not able to mediate the effect of financial distress on tax avoidance; 
transfer pricing affects tax avoidance, and financial distress affects tax avoidance.  This research implies that it is 
expected to contribute and refer to further research on the analysis of financial distress on tax avoidance mediated by 
transfer pricing.

Abstract 
In the wake of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), the world was on the verge of a new beginning, 
characterized by a profound synergy of technological advancements and societal transformation. At its core, Society 
5.0 envisions a harmonious coexistence of humans and advanced technologies, wherein the integration of digital and 
physical principalities redefines the very fabric of our daily lives. This vision transcends industrial boundaries and 
extends its influence across sectors, influencing healthcare, education, transportation, and urban development. 
Primarily, societal evolution is the dynamic interplay between Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0, where the metamorphic 
forces of advanced manufacturing technologies and automation interact with the broader societal objectives of 
inclusivity, sustainability, and quality of life. As Industry 5.0 fosters human-machine collaboration, optimized 
industrial processes, and smart-manufacturing, it becomes increasingly evident that these advancements are integral 
for procuring Society 5.0's overarching goals. 
Keywords 
Industry 5.0, Society 5.0, Collaboration, Human-Machine Collaboration, Optimized Industrial Processes. 
1. Introduction
The advent of Industry 4.0, marked by a technology-driven industrial revolution (Daniel Paschek, 2022), encapsulates 
the swift transformations in technology, industries, and societal dynamics over the recent decades. This paradigm shift 
aims to elevate production efficiency and quality through the integration and advancement of key technologies such 
as big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) , and digital twin to enhance human capabilities (Amit Kumar Tyagi, 
2023). Despite its strides, Industry 4.0 is not exempt from limitations; it tends to prioritize enhancing industry 
efficiency and flexibility over considerations for sustainable industrial applications and workforce prosperity. 
As a blueprint centered around human collaboration with collaborative robots (co-bots), Industry 5.0 has garnered 
intriguing curiosity in recent years. Its primary objective is to tackle the challenges revealed by Industry 4.0. 
Concurrently, another concept, Society 5.0, has emerged to address contemporary societal issues. Envisioned as a 
futuristic, highly intelligent society, Society 5.0 aims to provide a high-quality and comfortable life for everyone by

Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) (Rane, 2023): With the rapid development of robotics technology in Industry 
4.0, Diverse usage scenarios have been investigated to improve efficiency in production and elevate the quality of 
services. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) emerges as one of the research domains with considerable potential and 
complexity for achieving human-centricity in manufacturing systems. HRC involves the integration and 
complementation of human and machine intelligence, unleashing a continuous innovation capability, eliminating the 
necessity for large sensory networks, extensive data storage, and computational requirements (Sihan Huang, 2022). 
Future Employment and Workforce: As a consequence of the ongoing revolutions in industry and society, an 
increasing number of physical or repetitive tasks will be automated, leading to the elimination of many existing jobs 
and giving rise to unemployment issues and a range of significant social challenges. However, this process is also 
characterized by a positive trajectory, generating numerous new jobs that require a workforce adept in emerging 
technologies. Examples of these new roles include data analysts, automated guided vehicle (AGV) coordinators, 
augmented operators, and more. All stakeholders involved in this shift should be mindful of the unchangeable patterns 
of development, recognizing the need to efficiently adapt to the latest circumstances within a critical time window. 
Furthermore, to anticipate, react to, and recover from disruptions, a smart and resilient manufacturing (Jiewu Leng, 
2022) system is defined as an agile, flexible, and reconfigurable system. Such a system leverages real-time operational 
and environmental data through intelligent sensor systems, employing explanatory, anticipatory, and guiding analytics 
methodologies. 
 
Conclusion 
In summary, the exploration of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 underscores their shared focus on a human-centric future. 
Industry 5.0 envisions a resilient manufacturing system, while Society 5.0 aspires to create an intelligent and efficient 
community. Both concepts, though hypothetical (Marco Dautaj, 2022), converge on human centricity, aiming to 
balance economic development with societal well-being. 
 
A key concern is the impact on the workforce, particularly the potential loss of employment due to automation 
in Industry 5.0. The transition, though offering new opportunities in emerging technologies, requires careful 
consideration of disruptions. Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) emerges as a promising area, demanding a skilled 
workforce adept in working with intelligent machines. 
 
Shared fundamentals, like Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) and Green Intelligent Manufacturing (GIM), 
provide collaborative avenues for addressing challenges. As these concepts remain theoretical, stakeholders must 
navigate uncertainties and contribute collectively to ensure a prosperous future that prioritizes technological 
advancements alongside workforce welfare.

Abstract 
The Indonesian Army has a logistics function that requires transportation to support logistical distribution such as 
materials, facilities, and maintenance in its units. Types of transportation logistics that can be used consist of motorized 
transportation, trains, pipes, and horses. PT XYZ is one of the railroad companies that provides rail products for 
passenger and freight transport. Even that, PT XYZ has not contributed to providing transportation facilities for the 
logistics transportation of the Indonesian Army. This research was conducted to assess the manufacturing readiness 
level (MRL) of PT XYZ in providing Indonesian Army logistics transportation. This research is qualitative method 
which involves the collection and analysis of descriptive data. PT XYZ's manufacturing readiness level (MRL) 
assessment was carried out through the MRL meter. The results of the assessment were also validated directly by 
observation at PT XYZ workshops and interviews with the Heads of Fields. The results showed that PT XYZ's 
manufacturing readiness level (MRL) was at eight levels, which means it was ready to start initial production. Thus, 
it is still necessary to improve PT XYZ's efforts to increase its manufacturing readiness level (MRL) to support the 
Indonesian Army's logistics transportation. The strategies that should implemented by PT XYZ in supporting the 
Indonesian Army logistics transportation are market development, product development, innovation, joint ventures, 
and backward integration. In supporting Indonesian army logistics transportation, PT XYZ needs to collaborate with 
the government. PT XYZ could provide multipurpose trains through orders from the Indonesian Army and approval 
from the government.

1. Introduction
Based on Law No. 3 of 2002 point 1 paragraph 2, the national defense system is a universal defense system that 
involves all citizens, territories, and other national resources and is prepared early by the government and implemented 
in a total, integrated, directed, and continues to uphold state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the safety of the 
entire nation from all threats. The Indonesian National Army is part of the main component of national defense as 
stated in Law no. 34 of 2004 concerning the TNI, in article 3 it is stated that the main task of the TNI is to uphold state 
sovereignty, maintain the territorial integrity of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia based on the five

occur with existing transportation facilities, there must be an alternative. Trains are a mode of transportation that can 
be used to support Army logistics distribution. Both for personnel and goods so it is called multipurpose transportation. 
 
PT XYZ is part of a supporting component in the form of a national resource that has the opportunity to contribute by 
providing a multipurpose transportation function for trains. PT XYZ can become a Train Manufacturing Industry and 
service and retail service provider both at home and abroad. To foreign countries, PT XYZ demonstrated its industrial 
capability in fulfilling 250 units of Bangladeshi ordered trains of which 50 units had been fulfilled. As for 
domestically, XYZ has shown its existence with the establishment of several projects from consumers.  
 
PT XYZ has many factors to support their production system. There are mastery of manufacturing technology trains, 
starting from bogies, car bodies, and wagons to the locomotive; PT XYZ already has various designs train carriages 
that can be used as a benchmark in further design development; PT XYZ has 43 years production experiences and 
also skilled and qualified workforce; PT XYZ has a development division which is specifically carrying out railway 
product innovation. In other ways, PT XYZ has opportunity such as government policy in adding train lines fire and 
reactivation of fixed rails as a railroad crossing and PT XYZ has suppliers from abroad for supports the train 
production process. PT XYZ also has the construction of a new workshop in east java region to increase productivity.  
The government plays a role in developing PT XYZ's business. This is because the government is the axis of 
development, so public policies have a significant impact on PT XYZ's industry. An example is the Light Rail Transit 
(LRT) development policy which resulted in orders for LRT trains produced by PT XYZ. The government continues 
to improve equitable infrastructure development without the gaps. This development is also intended to expand 
employment opportunities, distribute state income sources evenly, expand transportation networks, and social 
protection, and encourage the people's economy (Merina and Mazda 2022). 
 
In supporting Indonesian army logistics transportation, PT XYZ needs to collaborate with the government. The Triple 
Helix is said to be a concept of synergistic collaboration between the Government, Universities, and Industry where 
the Government is the policy maker, the University is the center for research development, and the industry is the 
product provider to achieve common goals (Mazda et al. 2022). PT XYZ could provide multipurpose trains for 
Indonesian Army logistics transportation through orders from the Indonesian Army and approval from the 
government. The strategies that should implemented by PT XYZ in supporting the Indonesian Army logistics 
transportation are: 
1. Market development 
Export market development (local partners and cooperation with international markets with more advanced 
similar industries). New local government both to the government and local government as well as operators 
new trains with the support of both old and new products and improved customer service and funding support. 
 
2. Product development 
Product development for railway facilities/infrastructure and transportation, as well as in system development 
of new transportation to support the system of urban transportation. 
3. Innovation 
Stimulate research and development activities to produce new product innovations and develop new business 
schemes. 
4. Joint ventures 
Develop business capabilities and size business venture by opening up through business collaboration/ joint 
venture, and establishment of a subsidiary. 
5. Backward integration 
Improving the ability of subsidiaries to support and create a strong industrial pyramid 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Indonesian Army's logistics support is carried out through the operation of transportation facilities, regulation and 
control of transportation activities, and preparation of terminal facilities. The Indonesian Army's logistics 
transportation is influenced by the system that connects producers to the Indonesian Army as consumers. The transport 
mode is a grouping of transport types according to traffic, equipment, or energy. The five means of conveyance that 
can be used as logistics transportation are train, truck, ship, airplane, and pipes.  
 
PT XYZ's manufacturing readiness level (MRL) was at eight levels, which means it was ready to start initial 
production. Thus, it is still necessary to improve PT XYZ's efforts to increase its production capability so that its 
2139","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

manufacturing readiness level (MRL) is at the level and able to support the logistics distribution of the Indonesian 
Army. The strategy for developing multipurpose trains is to optimize the men, machines, materials, methods, money, 
and environment. The business strategy that could be done by PT XYZ is market development, product development, 
innovation, joint ventures, and backward integration. The most appropriate strategy by PT XYZ the first step is to 
innovate product development according to needs customer or user requirements and conduct a consortium with the 
domestic raw material supply industry providing raw materials for railway needs with a lead time or waiting time not 
too long. 
 
As a recommendation, in supporting Indonesian Army logistics transportation, PT XYZ needs to collaborate with the 
government. PT XYZ could provide multipurpose trains for Indonesian Army logistics transportation through orders 
from the Indonesian Army and approval from the government.

1. Introduction
Lean is a systematic methodology that aims to identify and eliminate various sources of wastes within a process 
(Dhiravidamani et al. 2018). This methodology has originated from the Toyota Production System and has been 
vital in minimizing the manufacturing time, human effort, and product costs (Bakke and Johansen 2019). 
Moreover, it was observed that inefficiencies or activities lacking value could constitute over 90% of the entire 
manufacturing process (Dhiravidamani et al. 2018). Consequently, implementing continuous improvement 
strategies becomes crucial for organizations to maintain their competitiveness. 
Lean methodologies have shown their effectiveness across many diversified industries, not only the manufacturing 
industry. Despite that, there is limited research on the context of the applicability of lean on the after-sale services 
industry, such as the preventative maintenance sector (Arlinghaus and Knizkov 2020). This case study explores 
the application of lean tools within the proactive maintenance industry. The company under study is a GCC

6. Conclusion  
 
 
In summary, this study undertook a thorough examination of the facility's existing operational landscape, 
pinpointing significant inefficiencies and highlighting avenues for enhancement. Improvements including the 
implementation of tool belts, movable storage, and a revamped layout, were proposed to enhance efficiency and 
minimize waste in the forthcoming operational phase. Moreover, the integration of 5S principles, alongside 
advanced technologies such as ERP and Kanban, is envisioned to reinforce the suggested enhancements. Beyond 
diagnosing current challenges, this research provides pragmatic, industry-aligned solutions, accomplishing the 
company's objectives in this lean project.

Abstract 
This article aims to implement a security model in a maintenance company to reduce accidents. The main problem 
is the high number of accidents recorded in the maintenance area, specifically 28 accidents in a 6-month period. Root 
causes are determined through a problem tree, and subsequently, tools such as the risk matrix, continuous IPERC, 
and safety procedures are assigned. The model was implemented in medium and low voltage electrical work, where 
a higher level of risk was identified through the risk matrix, specifically in the maintenance activities of medium and 
low voltage electrical panels, as well as in illuminated signs. Regarding the continuous IPERC matrix, it was 
developed for the identification and description of hazards and their sources in activities classified as more hazardous 
found in the risk matrix evaluation. Next, safety procedures were developed, with one for each more hazardous 
electrical job, detailing objectives, scopes, normative references, definitions, responsibilities, preventive measures, 
main procedure, PPE, and tools. By creating procedures for each hazardous activity, they were unified to form the 
main safety model. When implementing the model in the study company, results over two weeks showed a reduction 
in the number of accidents, thus achieving the main objective. The number of weekly accidents in the most hazardous 
electrical maintenance area decreased from 2 to 0. The uniqueness of this model lies in its specific focus on 
occupational safety in electrical work, particularly in medium and low voltage.

1. Introduction
In the 1980s, Facility Management services were primarily focused on cleaning management, activities with a 
relatively low level of risk. It was in the 1990s that the industry's integration saw an expansion into higher-risk 
activities, particularly in mechanical and electrical work (HODGGE, et al. 2014). 
It transitioned from being a simple outsourced contracting service to what is now considered a ""global phenomenon"" 
(Godino, et al. 2022). The attractiveness of companies engaged in FM business lies in the evolution this sector has 
undergone. This transformation is explained by significant internal changes within companies. They transitioned 
from being associated with cleaning, security, and maintenance sectors to becoming one of the broadest and most

assessed in comparison with the pre-established expectations. To be considered in the implementation results, all 
evaluated activities had to meet the minimum required number and adhere to the established procedures. The results 
are presented in the following Table 8.

4.1 Discussion 
In the literary realm, authors who previously undertook similar projects achieved comparable results in terms of 
effectiveness. However, it is noteworthy that they extended the implementation over a longer period compared to the 
execution of the present project. An example is the study by Arciniega et al. (2023), which applied its manual over a 
significantly more extended timeframe. In contrast, our risk analysis highlighted differences, identifying that electrical 
tasks and work at heights presented the highest risks. 
 
Vilchez-Castillo et al. (2022) incorporated the IPERC Matrix to identify the causes of delays in activities related to 
the occupational safety of the company. This tool reduced work deadlines from 125% to complete compliance with 
the established 100% timelines, eliminating a 25% delay in the scheduled deadlines. In our project, we aim to achieve 
100% compliance with deadlines by reducing accidents, eliminating penalties for lost time. 
 
Carrera et al. (2023) used the risk matrix and IPERC to identify and eliminate risk levels in the causes of accidents. 
They pointed out that static and dynamic loads were the main factors, related to excess weight loads and ergonomic 
postures. Applying these tools, they reduced the risk levels of static and dynamic loads from 10 to 5 and from 10 to 6, 
respectively. In our research, we also reduced risk levels in specific activities, such as illuminated signs and electrical 
panels. 
 
We identified six activities, three of high risk and three of moderate risk. Florian et al. (2023) identified 29 high and 
moderate-risk occupational hazards, while Medina et al. (2016), Neciosup et al. (2021), and Martínez et al. (2021) 
recorded 12, 262, and 60 occupational hazards, respectively. These risks, evaluated through risk matrices and IPERC, 
are significant and can lead to delays or accidents. 
 
Despite the obtained results, the study has limitations. The implementation period is relatively short, requiring long-
term monitoring. Worker resistance to change and limitations in accessing some confidential data can affect the 
accuracy of the results. 
 
The findings of this research have important theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, they confirm the 
effectiveness of the implemented safety model in the company. Practically, they indicate that these measures can 
significantly improve occupational safety and health, reduce costs associated with accidents, and enhance productivity. 
The implementation of the safety model to reduce accidents in electrical maintenance work has proven its 
effectiveness. However, a continuous approach with training and a safety culture is required to maintain and improve 
achievements in the long term. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
Using the risk matrix, it is concluded that the most hazardous activities in the maintenance area are those related to 
electrical work. This includes maintenance of low-voltage electrical panels, maintenance of medium-voltage electrical 
panels, maintenance work on illuminated signs at ground level, and/or using fixed or multidirectional scaffolding and 
hanging scaffolds. It is evident that challenges and risks associated with tasks such as electrical maintenance, or the 
installation of illuminated signs can be mitigated through specific measures. These actions help reduce the residual 
risk level to a point lower than the initial risk of the activity. The use of an IPERC matrix provides a clear 
representation of how these risks are anticipated and controlled, directly influencing the risk level associated with each 
task. It can be asserted that this anticipation is achieved by assigning preventive actions based on the established safety 
model.

The critical need to implement a specific safety model for medium and low-voltage energy tasks is important for a 
facilities management company. It was indicated that prior to the implementation of the safety model, there were a 
total of 22 accidents caused by energy-related tasks. Subsequently, it was calculated that accidents occurred at a rate 
of 2 per every 2 weeks. After implementing the specific safety model for medium and low-voltage tasks, the figure 
reduced to 0. Therefore, it can be conclusively stated that the functionality and the unique contribution of the research 
have been demonstrated. 
 
The procedures carried out are supported by national and international Occupational Health and Safety standards. 
From a legal perspective, the application of most of these standards is necessary. However, whether mandatory or not, 
the recommendations provided by some of these standards remain relevant. Even in cases where they may not be 
obligatory, they often serve as the foundation for performing a procedure. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of 
these standards is essential for guiding preventive or corrective procedures during the activities of any company in the 
industry. 
 
It is necessary that, for future projects, safety models be implemented over an average period of 3 to 6 months to 
achieve greater accuracy with the results. Likewise, continuous monitoring should be carried out to make the necessary 
corrections over the course of time.

Abstract 
The introduction of distance education over several decades ago appropriately created and provided opportunities to 
those interested in pursuing education at their own pace. Distance education over time took several distinctions, 
including online learning, learning on-demand, etc. The high-speed internet and the introduction of interactive 
software significantly improved online learning. They attracted several educational and academic institutions around 
the world to utilize these mediums to deliver educational and learning materials on demand. These delivery methods 
have proven to be cost-effective and significantly attractive to academic and technical institutions interested in 
expanding their markets and allowing applicants from a distance to pursue education and improve their technical 
skills. With the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, online education using digital interactive software became a norm 
and many education institutions encouraged their instructional teams to learn and adopt an institution-recommended 
system medium to deliver their lectures from the traditional face-to-face or in-person to synchronous or asynchronous 
methods. Texas A&M University campuses, including College Station and the campus located in Qatar (Middle East), 
followed the recommended delivery method in March 2020.  Texas A&M University formally started delivering in-
person degree programs in its Qatar campus in the fall of 2002.  This campus is located in Hamed Bin Khalifa Campus 
(formerly known as Education City). Since its inception, it has been offering four ABET-accredited engineering degree 
programs in chemical, electrical, mechanical, and petroleum engineering. By May 2023, over 1,300 completed and 
received undergraduate degrees in these four disciplines. The campus has historically and consistently been well 
regarded for its quality education and innovative approaches to teaching and learning methods in the Middle East and 
North Africa (MENA Region).  An empirical study has been conducted at Texas A&M University in Qatar and Texas 
A&M University in College Station, Texas, in two undergraduate courses taught on these two campuses. This article

The academic achievement during traditional face-to-face learning and remote in-class learning is displayed in Figures 
14, 15 and 16. More than half of the participants in ISEN 210 sections 1 and 2 reported that their academic performance 
was ineffective or very ineffective. In contrast, more than 81% and 66%, respectively, of respondents in ISEN 210 
sections 1 and 2 said that their academic performance was either effective or extremely effective. Just about 12% of 
students on the Qatar campus said their academic achievement was incredibly ineffective or ineffective. Additionally, 
almost 60% of respondents said that both cases' academic achievement was effective or extremely effective. 
 
There appears to be a direct correlation between undergraduate students' academic achievement and their involvement 
in class. Participation in class is evidently essential to improving their learning process. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Undergraduate students from both universities' responses revealed a number of commonalities. The results of the 
survey showed that students' academic achievement was impacted by their engagement in class. It's also important to 
note that having in-person training and availability to course instructors were chosen because they both have the 
potential to accelerate learning. 
 
The survey's findings also revealed that, in comparison to synchronous remote learning, fewer students attended 
classes that included laboratory components. The primary drawback of remote learning for engineering students is the 
inability to conduct research and carry out practical experimentation. Academic achievement seems to be higher in 
the traditional face-to-face setting.

Abstract 
Electric and Electronic market is growing rapidly. Thus, there is a huge amount of electronic waste (e-waste) due to 
technological advancements. These products include mobile phones, music players, televisions, refrigerators, 
computers, printers, and even medical equipment. Although e-waste Management system implementation enhances 
social, environmental, and economic sustainability, e-waste management in Egypt suffers from lack of systematic 
approaches and improper technologies, and on top of all, the lack of collection and sorting process of e-waste. The 
study aims to investigate Egyptian household awareness concerning the e-waste collection and treatment proposes, it 
proposes strategies that act as a roadmap for effective e-waste management, including raising awareness, establishing 
e-waste legislation, and promoting collaboration between stakeholders. Moreover, the current research provides a
recommendation for developing a comprehensive e-waste estimation framework. Finally, the investigation highlights
the calling need for improved e-waste awareness, legislation, and recycling practices in Egypt.

1. Introduction
The business world is facing high competition in the electronic market due to the rapid evolution of electronic devices 
which leads to the rapid generation of e-waste (Doan et al. , 2019), E-waste includes electrical components or circuits 
with either battery or power supply, such as TVs, computers, mobile phones, white goods, home entertainment and 
appliances generated by household, industrial, and institutional sectors (Shaikh, 2021). Egypt has the highest e-waste 
generation among African countries, it generates more than 20% of e-waste generated in the whole continent (Sakr et 
al., 2021) However, The Egyptian government has not yet developed a legislative framework for e-waste in Egypt (G. 
Iattoni, 2021).  
Accordingly, this study aims to investigate Egyptian household awareness concerning the e-waste collection and 
treatment, while highlighting the hazardous effect of untreated e-waste and the importance of recycling the WEEE 
(Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and identifying the key variables associated with the households’ 
awareness, consumption of electronic devices, and the disposal of e-waste behavior, through a random sample. 
This research seeks to achieve the following objectives:

positive towards electronic waste treatment. Mohamad et al. (2022) stated that the consumers show willingness to 
invest more to buy green electronic equipment when they are aware of the environmental considerations.  
 
These results confirm that awareness is the most significant factor influencing participation in electronic waste 
recycling. It refers to the individual’s perception of all changes that surround him and his reaction to these changes. 
This confirms that developing the level of the individual’s participation in recycling electronic waste requires 
increased level of awareness according to on two basics: first, individual awareness of the hazardous effect of e-waste. 
Second, the benefits that can be accrued from its value. 
 
5.3 Testing Hypothesis  
The coefficient of determination (R Square) which refers to the explained variance of the predictors. For the first 
predictor (Awareness) R Square value was (.246) and this indicates that the awareness explains alone about 24.6% 
from the variance in the (Consumer Participation) as dependent variable. Accordingly, the first hypothesis is 
statistically accepted. 
 
For the second predictor (Behavior) R Square value was (.026) and this indicates that the behavior explains alone 
about 2.6% from the variance in the (Consumer Participation) as dependent variable. Accordingly, the second 
hypothesis is statistically accepted. 
 
6. Conclusion and recommendation  
Egypt generates high level of e-waste and it’s the highest e-waste generation among African countries, it generates 
more than 20% of e-waste generated in the whole continent. This study highlights the importance of e-waste 
management system in Egypt. It identified 2 independent variables that will affect consumer’s participation which are 
the consumer’s awareness and the consumer’s behavior.  The consumer’s awareness has the strongest connection with 
the customer’s participation, and it is stated that the consumer’s behavior relies on their awareness towards e-waste 
management systems. A structured questionnaire was conduct among households in Egypt to address the consumer’s 
awareness and behavior, and its impact on the consumer’s participation.  
 
This study recommends developing comprehensive legislation framework to define electronic waste, distinguish 
between hazardous and non-hazardous materials involved in e-waste, and address the treatment of parts containing 
hazardous materials, establishing education programs to encourage the responsible e-waste disposal practices, increase 
collection points to be present in universities, schools, family club, and shopping malls to make it easier for the 
consumer to dispose discarded electronic devices. Launching awareness campaigns among youth in schools and 
universities as they are with greatest potential to commit to safe disposal of electronic devices and using social media 
platforms to spread the awareness as it is an effective tool for fast spreading. Doing this, effective e-waste management 
system can be achieved through high rates of consumer’s participation that is resulted from increased awareness and 
positive disposal behavior. 
 
7. Research Limitations  
This study analyzes the impact of households’ e-waste awareness and disposal behavior on customer participation in 
Egypt. It has potential limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, Governmental legislations and procedures for 
the proper handling and recycling of electronic waste are not studied. Secondly, the hazardous effect of e-waste on 
human health is not investigated. Additionally, the environmental assessment of e-waste is not analyzed. Furthermore, 
the financial indicators and economic returns of e-waste collection is not addressed.

Robust Security System with Toll Free Call Services. Case 
Study: Adama City 
Shenko Chura Aredo 
Adama City Administration 
Ethiopia 
Abstract 
Toll-free numbers are calling numbers that have unique three- or four-digit numbers and that don't require payment 
from phone lines in order to be called. With the help of these numbers, callers can connect with nearby organizations 
and/or people without incurring far-reaching fees. Calls to assistance centers are especially popular from toll-free 
phones. In the past, toll-free services have offered prospective clients and other parties a simple and cost-free means 
of getting in touch with enterprises. Nevertheless, unless they have an ""unlimited calling"" plan, wireless subscribers 
will be billed for the airtime minutes used during a toll-free call.  In Adama, the second largest city in Ethiopia,  a call 
center has been installed as part of smart security system and serving since January 2023 for collection of complaints 
from different community levels. The call center is situated at the mayor office and has 11 active workers, 4 of these 
working the night time and the remaining during day time. The information reported in the form of complaints from 
individuals and groups are illegal constructions, illegal trade, income concealment or hiding, giving and receiving 
bribe, informing new faces of suspected enemies and exposing individual or group conflicts. This technology has been 
found to bring a significant outcome in minimizing illegal acts, public safety threats and service delivery problems.

Introduction
In Africa, health systems are poorly accessible, in- equitable, and unresponsive. People rarely have either the 
confidence or the opportunity to express their opinions. In Burkina Faso, there is a political will to improve governance 
and responsiveness to create a more relevant and equitable health system (Lechat 2019). 
The study in (Rajapaksha 2022) aims to investigate the feasibility of implementing a decision support system for 
reporting in order to produce improved analytics and facilitate better decision-making by the Department of 
Agriculture’s upper management of Sri Lanka. The goal is to make informed decisions more easily and quickly than 
other ordinary communication reporting method. 
According to the authors in (Huq 2014), in one Bangladeshi sub district, a toll-free mobile phone intervention to assist 
mothers during their pregnancies and deliveries was tested. A qualitative study was carried out to assess how mobile 
phone use has changed in terms of facilitating communication regarding difficulties related to mothers and newborns. 
According to the findings, over 80% of Community Trained Birth attendants contacted Solution Connected 
Community in order to receive advice on managing maternal health. 
The article in (Zhang 2005) outlines the toll-free IP (TIP) de- sign and how the important protocols interfaces are 
implemented using the defined diameter base proto- col. TIP is a new technique of provide no-charge-to- user (”toll-
free”) access over IP-based access networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11 and 802.16 wireless local area net- works). The owner 
or operator of the toll-free location is responsible for covering the cost of using IP access networks to interact with it 
(as indicated by the toll- free IP address, Internet Domain Name, or Universal Resource locater, for example).

5. Conclusion 
There are currently three mayoral goals of Adama City in making the city competent with other modern cities 
in the world. Among those initiatives, smart security is the one which plays a crucial role in ensuring 
public safety and development. A toll-free call center has been created and put into operation as part of smart 
security to gather data from various public sectors. As a consequence, eleven months after the project’s 
inception, the following outcomes have been achieved. 
 
• 
Illegalities have been reduced by about 95% com- paring the first month and last month registration. 
• 
Average group and individual conflicts have been minimized by about 80%. 
• 
Average service delivery problem grievances have been reduced by 91%.

These outcomes are the consequence of intact communication with every stakeholder and widespread pro- 
motion of the technology to raise awareness among residents, clients alike, and customers. Future 
recommendations to improve system reliability and efficiency include integrating the system with artificial 
intelligence- powered closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and bulk Short Message Services (SMS).

Abstract 
Manufacturing companies face many challenges when trying to meet the market and their clients’ demands. Building 
and operating highly automated lines is not a straightforward task, especially when the bottle format is unique, and 
the line is being built from the ground up to accommodate the new format. In this study, downtime data and Overall 
Equipment Efficiency (OEE) analysis was used to determine the effectiveness of a newly built mayonnaise bottling 
line during the ramp-up period and the main reasons behind low OEE, a lengthy ramp-up period, and high downtime. 
Two pieces of machinery were the most significant contributors to downtime, a newly bought labeler, whose factory 
acceptance test (FAT) was never performed, and an old, repurposed drop packer, that was previously being used for 
a much larger packaging format. It was found that the two machines had the same MTTF (mean time to failure) value. 
A model was built to predict the likelihood of attainment loss using a Monte Carlo simulation after performing a 
goodness of fit analysis on the time-to-failure (TTF) and time-to-repair (TTR) data available. From this model, the 
availability of the line was determined, and the effect of the two equipment was shown to be strong on the overall 
performance of the line.

1. Introduction
The food and beverage industry is the second largest industry in all of Canada accounting for 17% of total sales in 
manufacturing (Government of Canada 2023). This sector has been growing consistently over the years and 
contributes significantly to the country’s GDP (Wunsch 2021). This growth, combined with the increasing complexity 
and customization of customer demand, is adding pressure on designing and efficiently operating highly automated 
production lines. Automation reduces the number of operators needed on the line, and is mostly applied for 
monotonous, repetitive, and complex tasks (Zennaro et al. 2018). In addition to these challenges, food manufacturing 
companies in Canada must meet SQF requirements, which is the Food Safety Code of Manufacturing, and are assigned 
a rating based on compliance and a yearly Audit Score (The SQF Institute 2017). This will virtually determine the 
market share of a manufacturing company by strengthening (or weakening) its competitiveness and reputation. 
2199","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

It is significant that the MTTF values for a new machine and an old, worn-down machine are comparable. One reason 
that might have contributed to this is the fact that in many cases, when the labeler breaks down, or misfires, issues 
arise downstream. A misfire at the labeler can cause fallen bottles to go through the steam tunnel. The bottles then 
jam up and stay inside the steam tunnel enough time for them to bloat and become misshapen. If the bottles continue 
downstream to the drop packer, they will jam up inside and cause another breakdown. In fact, bloated bottles are 
considered defective, and should be disposed of. Solving this problem meant resolving the bloated bottle issue, which 
was caused by the misfire at the labeler. 
 
This could lead to the conclusion that the condition and performance of upstream equipment can affect the 
performance of the equipment downstream, regardless of their condition. Nevertheless, it would not be accurate to 
attribute the downtime on the drop packer entirely to issues with the labeler. A good practice in dealing with this type 
of issue is to analyze the line from the bottom up, because in this particular case, loose caps caused by issues on the 
capping machine might have driven the number of misfires at the labeler by a big margin. 
 
5.2 Graphical Results 
Figure 3 below shows the probability distribution as outputted by the software. There is 10.93% chance that the 
Labeler would not be available enough to produce the required attainment goal.

Similarly, the same calculations were made for the drop packer, and this time the full 203 minutes are accounted for. 
Figure 4 below shows that the availability of the drop packer will be below 68% 15.21% of the time.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Before making the decision to bring a new piece of equipment without doing the FAT, a thorough risk analysis must 
be performed, as well as related losses in terms of possible line downtime and equipment shipment delay. Also, 
repurposing old machines should not only be limited to purchasing change parts for the new bottle format, but a 
machine audit and IO check (input/output, which is used to make sure the logic is working correctly) must be 
performed, possibly before even making the decision to use it on another line. This is because in certain cases, certain

parts become obsolete, and the OEM does not support it anymore. Some parts could be redesigned by the OEM, simply 
because of bad historical performance, and would be recommended to be changed before using the machine again. 
 
Although this study was done after the fact, it could be used as a reference or as framework to analyze a line before 
assembly and procurement. Old repurposed drop packing machines and new labelling machines are most likely to be 
the most problematic when running a unique bottle format. 
When making decisions or machine selection, careful analysis must be made to reduce the ramp-up period duration. 
Short-term solutions and rushing the delivery of machinery is an aggressively high-risk method that would reduce the 
chances of achieving the production goal over a long period of time (in this case, at least 65 days). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Line performance during the ramp-up period can determine a product launch failure or success, and it is a critical 
period where all the equipment have to be brought up to speed to reach a steady output that can be reasonably 
maintained. It is quite different than line performance during normal operation and can point to issues in line design 
and shortcomings in the planning and commissioning processes of an organization. 
 
A thorough risk analysis must be performed before making decisions related to new and old equipment, and this study 
showed that risk can be reasonably quantified based on historical data of the same type of machinery in the market. 
 
The engineering management process in line design and commissioning is not straightforward but rather very complex 
where many contributing factors come into play. This places managers and designers under the constant pressure of 
handling uncertainty, but scientific approaches can help in quantifying it and reduce this potentially devastating aspect 
of all engineering projects.

Abstract 
The German government introduced the concept of ""Industry 4.0"" in 2011 as part of its high-tech policy, aiming to 
address emerging challenges and sustain the competitiveness of the German manufacturing industry. This paper 
explores the assessment of a firm's preparedness for Industry 4.0 through readiness modeling. Recognizing the 
complexity of Industry 4.0 technology adoption, the study proposes a two-phase research approach involving 
identifying impediments and evaluating readiness based on each company's maturity level. Leadership emerges as a 
critical factor in determining a company's strategy for implementing Industry 4.0, emphasizing the need for industrial 
managers to prioritize assessing preparedness levels and overcoming obstacles to change. The study underscores the 
importance of institutional policies and stakeholder support, calling for further investigation to articulate Industry 4.0 
hurdles and identify strategies for mitigation. Success in the next stage of digitization hinges on adopting effective 
technology and business strategies. Germany and other developed nations enjoy a significant advantage through using 
smart devices as platforms for innovative services and business concepts. To stay competitive globally, businesses 
and nations must leverage this advantage.

1. Introduction
The term ""Industry 4.0"" or ""fourth industrial revolution"" describes how advanced analytics, digital technologies, and 
smart devices are integrating to continuously transform conventional manufacturing and industrial practices. The goal 
of this paradigm change is to establish ""smart factories"" where systems, machinery, and processes are networked to 
maximize productivity, efficiency, and decision-making (Shadravan and Parsaei, 2022). 
Industry 4.0 encompasses crucial elements such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big data 
analysis, cloud computing, and cyber-physical systems. Real-time data interchange between machines is made 
possible by these technologies, which improves manufacturing process monitoring, control, and customization 
(Shadravan and Parsaei, 2023A). Furthermore, Industry 4.0 highlights the significance of decentralized decision-
making and human-machine collaboration, resulting in production systems that are more adaptable and versatile. 
Creating industrial environments that are more responsive, intelligent, and agile is the overarching objective of 
Industry 4.0 (Shadravan and Parsaei, 2023B). 
Even though Industry 4.0 is linked to significant improvements for businesses, the term itself still lacks a universal 
definition, particularly when it comes to the transfer of knowledge from theoretical research to the implementation in 
organizations, which causes misunderstanding and disbelief. New business domains and research methodologies 
cannot be developed because Industry 4.0 lacks a comprehensive definition and a well-defined framework. The 
purpose is to offer a definition that is solely objective and grounded in statistical analysis, without limiting the 
publications that are chosen to reflect a particular field of study or industry. A new and widely accepted definition of

The SEW company's productivity has grown as a result, and most of the strenuous physical labor associated with 
moving materials and semi-products has been lifted off the workforce. As the human factor is the only thing standing 
in the way of total automation in this organization. For instance, the most effective way to put together working teams 
for a certain product is to consider the abilities of each team member. Naturally, such choices cannot be made 
automatically (Strange et al. 2017). 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper aims to enhance Industry 4.0 within a production system by examining prevalent perspectives in both 
Industry 4.0 and manufacturing. By summarizing diverse viewpoints, it identifies key concepts shaping future 
manufacturing processes to guide the research direction. Like many industries, there exists a significant disparity 
between present practices and the attainment of Industry 4.0, as highlighted in this study. Furthermore, the paper 
presents an Industry 4.0 framework, illustrating how various intelligence level technologies operate across three stages 
of production system automation. This framework clearly indicates that the trajectory of current manufacturing is 
moving towards Industry 4.0. 
 
The heightened interest surrounding the emerging industrial model, commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, has sparked 
inquiries regarding its concept, technological requirements, and associated impacts. This study focuses on Industry 
4.0, aiming to elucidate its essence characterized by connectivity and the digitization of production processes. It 
examines the effects on production systems, management practices, economics, and broader societal implications. 
This transformative phase is marked by disruptive technological advancements erasing boundaries between the virtual 
and physical realms, integrating workers, smart machines, products, and production systems. However, Industry 4.0 
is primarily shaped by two key drivers: CPS and IoT. Companies transitioning towards Industry 4.0 must comprehend 
its multifaceted influences and implications while recognizing opportunities for innovation to enhance process 
efficiency and competitiveness. This paradigm shift holds significant potential for organizations, extending beyond 
industrial transformation to impact various sectors including products, services, business models, markets, economies, 
work environments, and skill development. 
 
6. Recommendations 
Professional, academic, and vocational training will be essential for the future successful application of digitalization, 
from a practical standpoint. It is necessary to develop training programs and other initiatives that address the 
theoretical elements of Industry 4.0 and connect them to the real-world applications of machines' growing complexity. 
Brief recommendations for businesses: 
• 
Participate actively in global standards initiatives. 
• 
Put an emphasis on open interfaces, modular products, and interoperability. 
• 
Take part in industry-specific integration platforms and testbeds. 
• 
Businesses could use a piggyback approach to share big businesses' resources. 
• 
Create new business models in harmony with the technologies of Industry 4.0. 
• 
Make the most of innovation centers' potential

Abstract 
The intense competition in the business world drives entrepreneurs to seek a competitive advantage. The culinary 
business is one of the rapidly growing sectors in Indonesia. PT XYZ is a culinary brand offering fast-serving coffee 
products with the fastest growth rate in Indonesia. Customer satisfaction with their needs and desires can be achieved 
through marketing activities. Therefore, the ability to formulate and develop appropriate marketing programs is one 
of the main challenges in creating an exchange process between producers and consumers. The aim of this research is 
to analyze the level of customer satisfaction with PT XYZ. This study uses a quantitative approach with the Importance 
Performance Analysis method based on questionnaire results from 130 PT XYZ customers. The results of this research 
indicate that PT XYZ needs to focus on improving attributes in quadrant 1, maintaining attributes in quadrant 2, and 
continuously monitoring and maintaining the quality of attributes in quadrant 3. Additionally, efforts should be made 
to reduce attributes in quadrant 4. By making these improvements, PT XYZ can better satisfy customers and enhance 
overall customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
The culinary business is currently experiencing rapid growth. The culinary business is considered a profitable and 
evergreen venture because food is a basic human necessity that cannot be separated from people's lives. People will 
always need a source of food and drinks, even in the most challenging situations. This potential target market can be 
utilized to capture the interest of the public (Hidayatullah et al., 2018). The culinary business has a high turnover of 
money in a short period, so many people turn to the culinary business to make a living. The culinary business 
encompasses various categories, including snacks or snacks, beverages, and staple foods such as rice and side dishes. 
As a result, many business owners still see opportunities in the culinary business because there are always new ideas

Kuadran 2, attributes to maintain, indicates variables that should be maintained because they are of high quality and 
have high importance/satisfaction ratings from users. The product/service excellence is determined by variables in 
this quadrant.  
 
 
Item 2 
: 
PT XYZ is known for its delightful coffee taste 
Item 6 
: 
PT XYZ maintains cleanliness and hygiene in its products and premises 
Item 8 
: 
PT XYZ products are designed for convenience, spill-resistant, and easy to carry. 
 
All the indicators in this quadrant are considered sufficient (good) in reality, so they do not require further discussion. 
However, if you want to maximize potential, the indicators in this quadrant can be alternatives for improvement.  
 
Kuadran 3  
Kuadran 3, attributes to maintain, indicates variables that are less of a priority, have low quality, and have low 
importance/satisfaction levels, and can be ignored.  
 
Item 3 
: 
PT XYZ provides a diverse range of toppings 
Item 5 
: 
PT XYZ offers larger drink sizes without raising prices 
 
Indicators in this quadrant show that PT XYZ customers do not consider the presence of diverse toppings important, 
and the assessment of PT XYZ's performance in providing varied toppings is also low. Furthermore, customers do not 
prioritize the size or volume of the drinks served by PT XYZ, and the assessment of PT XYZ's performance in 
increasing cup size or volume without a price increase is also low. Therefore, the indicators in this quadrant are not a 
concern, as they do not meet customer expectations.  
 
Kuadran 4  
Kuadran 4, low leverage, attributes to de-emphasize, indicates variables that can be considered excessive because they 
have high quality but are less desired or have low importance/satisfaction levels. They can be reduced for efficiency.  
 
Item 7 
: 
PT XYZ has a brand image that is easily recognized in various regions 
 
In this quadrant, the public perceives that the item is not important, but the company emphasizes it excessively. PT 
XYZ customers believe that the PT XYZ brand image does not benefit them. However, it is essential for PT XYZ, so 
the company strives to open various branches across regions to attract customers. Customers perceive that PT XYZ is 
overly ambitious in expanding its branches to various regions, which they consider unnecessary. Therefore, if 
optimization is desired, the items in this quadrant can be made more efficient. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The conclusion drawn from this research is that the level of customer satisfaction with PT XYZ products is 74%. 
Customer satisfaction with PT XYZ is observed in attributes such as price, taste, nutritional content, hygiene, and 
convenience. Conversely, customer dissatisfaction pertains to attributes like size, serving, and brand image. Customers 
perceive that attributes related to taste, cleanliness, and convenience have high importance and performance, indicating 
that customers find the taste of the coffee, the cleanliness, and the convenience of the product to be in line with their 
expectations. Furthermore, customers place high importance on the price attribute, but its performance is still low. 
This suggests that customers expect PT XYZ to be more affordable than its current price. Additionally, customers 
believe that PT XYZ overly emphasizes its brand image, which is not important to them. Finally, customers consider 
size and serving to be less important when enjoying PT XYZ.

PT XYZ ensures its composition doesn't have adverse health effects 
  
The solutions or recommendations for the issues in this quadrant should focus on how PT XYZ can provide more 
affordable prices to its customers. One way PT XYZ can achieve this is by using locally sourced coffee beans, which 
are more cost-effective. Additionally, PT XYZ can make efforts to streamline its supply chain and business operations 
to reduce operational costs, such as minimizing store operational expenses and leveraging technology in the production 
process. PT XYZ can also explore various partnerships and business strategies that allow them to offer competitive 
prices to customers. Thus, PT XYZ can provide more affordable prices without compromising the quality of its 
products. Another solution is to ensure that PT XYZ maintains a composition that does not have adverse health effects. 
PT XYZ pays attention to the composition of the ingredients used in its coffee beverages, such as the type of coffee 
beans, sugar, milk, and other additives. The company emphasizes the use of natural and high-quality ingredients while 
minimizing the use of chemicals and preservatives in its production. Concerning health, PT XYZ also complies with 
the relevant food safety regulations and standards in Indonesia to ensure that the beverages produced are safe for 
consumption and do not have adverse health effects on its customers. Additionally, the company provides options for 
customers to adjust the sugar and milk content in their coffee beverages according to their preferences, offering choices 
with lower sugar and milk content for health-conscious consumers.

Abstract 
The intention of this work is to appraise literature on Waste Management in Southern Africa to provide an analysis of 
sources of publication, citations and authorship using bibliometric analysis techniques (VOSviewer and Scopus). 
VOSviewer is a software device for building and envisaging bibliometric linkages. Such linkages embrace journals, 
researchers, or individual publications, and they were used based on citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or 
co-authorship relations. It was as well utilised to build and visualize co-occurrence networks of important terms 
extracted from a body of scientific literature. 
Keywords 
Waste management, South Africa, Reverse logistics, Bibliometric analysis, Bioenergy production, LCA. 
1. Introduction
A bibliometry is an investigative technique utilised to get computable outcomes from a systematic production. It is 
likewise taken as a way to scrutinise publications on statistical approaches, to study a definite theme, and to internally 
measure the systematic procedure (Algawe, Schiffauerova, Kuzgunkaya and Shiboub 2019). Facts and analysis found 
on methodical production help discover the progress of a specific theme, diverse study areas, and forthcoming inquiry 
prospects. It is also supportive for projecting and policymaking the fundamentals considered in a bibliometric 
investigation, there is official affiliation, dates of publication, journals, books, authors, citations, keywords, titles, and 
abstracts, amongst other sources of data encompassed in the documents. Such fundamentals are pertinent to gain the 
evidence of the results in a research field; thus, these will be used to achieve the purpose of this study. Bibliometric 
examination is regarded as an authenticated exploration practice in numerous discourses, including trade, technology, 
and info metrics. Bibliometric review in this work was done in the Reverse logistics know-hows to figure out the 
greatest remaining works and to appraise their evolution and the studies in progress.  (Viswanathan and Telukdarie, 
2022). 
SADC has acknowledged that the region has waste management challenges, which include a growing population that 
has resulted in increased volumes of waste generated and the increased complexity of the waste stream. As the smallest

publications. The concurrence of keywords reflects the frequency with which two keywords appear together in the 
same publication. The concurrence of keywords can be used to identify the main themes or concepts in a research 
domain (Viswanathan and Telukdure, 2022). 
 
7. Limitations 
Given that only Scopus was utilised, further published works obtainable somewhere else could have been overlooked. 
Other potential publications, like proceedings papers, books and theses were not considered to give insights to this 
bibliometric study. Clustering from co-citation inquiry merely conveys close to similar aspects and enhances certain 
ideas and concepts at the expense of other crucial publications. Some perspectives could come from additional 
dimensions of investigation like co-occurrence examination or bibliographic coupling. Nevertheless, such analyses 
were not vital to this work.  
 
8. Conclusion 
A close analysis of the resultant data discovered some intuitions about many features of studies in this area. A case in 
point, the appraisal noted a dearth of scholarly work on “waste supply chain,” “waste reverse logistics” and “Block 
chains in relation to supply chain (Christopher and Holweg 2011). The research also reveals that advanced countries 
like India, United States, China, Japan, and Germany have the greatest pertinent research on the investigated subject. 
Southern Africa and other less developed nations must also undertake research in reverse logistics and integrate that 
with inquiries on supply chain management and block chain technology. The funding of studies on reverse logistics 
integration with supply chain management and block chain technology also need to be considered in Southern Africa. 
Such funding may be non-existent in Southern Africa. Upcoming research ought to widen the scope of inquiry and 
expand its findings by integrating other sources, comprising additional renowned databases like Business Source 
Premier, Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation, and WoS.

followed by Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe which have 3;3 and 1 articles respectively. South Africa, Botswana, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe have a combined 51 articles on reverse logistics. That is nearly three times the research done 
by Turkey which has the lowest articles in the table showing articles on reverse logistics by the group of developed 
countries. This calls for increased investment in research and knowledge acquisition on the discourse of block chain

Abstract 
This paper explores Waste management practices through rereading the current literature and debates the existing state 
of Waste management research, as well as potential research directions using VosView. The paper steered a 
bibliometric scrutiny of the significant readings of Waste Management in terms of several facets, like research areas, 
journals, countries/regions, institutions, writers and corresponding authors, highly quoted publications, and author 
keywords, grounded on reviews and articles gathered from the Scopus, SCI and SSCI databank of the Web of Science 
(WoS) between 2012 and 2023.

1. Introduction
According to the South African DEAT (2005) the volume of South Africa’s climate-warming gases has increased by 
nearly 25% over the past ten years with emissions from the waste sector, mainly rotting garbage sent to municipal 
dumps and rotting human and industrial sewage in waste-water treatment plants, increasing by almost 60% and 
accounting for almost 3% of overall emissions. Landfill now accounts for 13% of all global methane gas emissions. 
Methane is second only to carbon dioxide in terms of contributing to global warming. South Africa is the highest 
emitter of greenhouse gas emissions on the African continent and is the twelfth highest emitter globally. The researcher 
aims to review LCA literature that will highlight social and environmental impacts of bioenergy production so as to 
mitigate Climate Change and to model cleaner bioenergy production (Frischknet et al. 2007). Global climate change 
is the greatest challenge of the 21st century, and it affects all aspects of society, including health, commerce, and 
democracy. Key research focus areas for capacity growth would also include: 1. Decision science (e.g., agent-based 
modeling), and 2) geospatial science (e.g., data acquisition and integration). This research contributes to resource 
recovery and sustainable waste management. In terms of sustainable waste management, municipalities are charged 
with the responsibility of managing these waste types yet they face many challenges such as collection and manpower. 
The literature review will focus on the identification of success factors for effective waste to energy reverse logistics.

frameworks is the need to consider the social, economic and work impacts well-coordinated waste collection towards 
the production of biofuels. Coordinated sustenance fuel providences can join sustainable bioenergy production with 
food generation to advance social and monetary development as such, to integrate local individuals into future food / 
fuel frameworks is important in determining whether advanced bioenergy frameworks can benefit South Africa's 
poorest (Muzenda, 2014).  
 
The importance of the development of the renewable sector is further emphasized by the inclusion of the national 
infrastructure plan as a comprehensive strategic plan. It is overseen by the President's Infrastructure Coordination 
Committee and aims to accelerate development and growth in South Africa. The South African government sees 
renewable energy as a way to address renewable energy climate change, improve energy security by diversifying 
energy supplies, and promote green growth through localization and empowerment. (DEA, 2011). 
 
Information on existing reverse logistics networks in the municipal waste to energy was collected and the sample size 
for the survey with bioenergy industries and with other relevant stakeholder groups will be defined. The literature 
reveal motivating factors for the stakeholders to participate in waste to energy activities. Furthermore, the survey 
provides the necessary data for the environmental and social impact assessment (Khan et al, 2021). 
 
In order to analyse the benefits of waste reverse logistics from an environmental point of view alternative disposal 
scenarios need to be defined. In particular, alternative disposal options include incineration (without energy recovery) 
and landfilling. Life cycle inventories for landfills and waste incineration plants have been issued by (Mololan, 2020). 
The work of Lia et al (2022) includes Excel calculation tools which can be adapted to specific waste compositions 
and reusing packaging material through reverse logistics.  
 
5. Conclusions 
Waste created from different portions in society requests spry intercessions in all perspectives of waste administration 
exercises requiring quick observing, information collection and capacity to supply decision support. The elements 
within the whole chain of occasions in waste administration are set to alter through the usage of Industry 4.0 (4IR) 
innovations. Understanding this innovation alter and its affect on waste administration viewpoints requires basic 
assessments.  
 
Recent writing enlightens that waste management being the central adage of 4IR advances and circular economy with 
a point to realize supportability are the pushed zones in both creating and created countries. The citation examination 
based on archives utilizing VOSviewer highlights inquire about intrigued on the zones like affect of 4IR in economical 
squander administration with circular economy, IoT part in realizing savvy city with selection boundaries and part of 
enormous information in valorisation. The coauthorship network outline uncovers a shared collaboration between 
analysts resulting in articles/publications as a spin-off of information sharing. Bibliographic coupling based on 
archives cited assist opened up the discoveries from the quotation investigation showing points like develop waste 
administration handle integration through IoT, displaying 4IR affect in waste administration and choice making 
through huge information. The nation based bibliographic coupling are reliable with citation investigation. The 
keyword co-occurrence network map clearly brings out IoT, artificial intelligence and big data as the key 4IR 
technologies, internet, embedded systems and digital storage as tools in the waste management process. The cluster 
highlights the 4IR intervention in supply chain management, waste treatment and valorisation (big data), recycling, 
and logistics. In order to create a loop economy, this study emphasizes the necessity of integrating waste management 
with 4IR technology. Data gathering is clearly needed for planning and decision support, and technology intervention 
is required to manage trash and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by reducing, recycling, and 
reusing it.

Abstract 
Kuwait ranks as the second most air-polluted country in the world (Arab Times, 2023). Air pollution contributes to 
respiratory diseases, including wheezing, coughing, asthma, and heart disease. This study investigates whether there 
is a significant difference between the perceived air quality and the actual air quality level. We collected perceived air 
quality from residents of Kuwait (n=144), along with demographic, lifestyle, and health condition information. At the 
same time, we also measured the actual air quality at the exact locations where the survey was conducted. This allowed 
us to assess if individuals could accurately perceive the air quality in their environment. The obtained data indicated 
that people with respiratory problems (such as asthma or frequent coughing) perceived the air as dirtier compared to 
those without such health issues (ANOVA P-value<0.001). This observation is consistent with previous studies. 
Interestingly, no significant correlation was found between perceived air quality and actual PM2.5 levels, but a 
correlation with PM10 levels was evident. This suggests that people generally notice larger particles (PM10) more 
easily than smaller particles (PM2.5). Furthermore, individuals with respiratory conditions are more sensitive to poor 
air quality.

Abstract 
This paper explores the operational efficacy of an Iron Ore sample preparation laboratory using the Overall Equipment 
Effectiveness (OEE) model. Addressing the discrepancy between the laboratory's production capacity and the client's 
expectation of reduced turnaround time, the study investigates the impact of operational inefficiencies on customer 
satisfaction. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combines quantitative data from a time and motion 
study with qualitative insights from interviews and observations. The findings reveal that by eliminating planned stops, 
an increased target of six batches per day could be achieved, enhancing the monthly output, and addressing the current 
backlog. Quality checks embedded in the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) ensured 100% process 
quality with no reworks observed during the study period. The study concludes that optimizing the performance metric 
across workstations is pivotal to improving productivity and overall operational efficacy, with the potential to reduce 
sample turnaround time significantly. Recommendations include comprehensive training for personnel, 
implementation of pre-emptive screen tests, and ergonomic adjustments to the equipment. For future research, the 
paper suggests comparative studies across diverse laboratory settings, the adoption of experimental designs for 
empirical validation of improvements, and the use of simulations and qualitative methods to predict outcomes and 
understand operational challenges comprehensively.

1. Introduction
According to Chen, Xu, and Yao (2022), the mining and metallurgy industries have always been essential components 
of the development of any civilization, even though they are classified as high-risk industries. According to Aguilar 
(2023), the mining and metals industry plays a significant role in a variety of socioeconomic systems. It is responsible 
for supplying essential materials for a variety of economic activities, including construction, transportation, and energy 
production (Aguilar 2023). The mining industry is widely considered to be the most significant source of revenue for 
a significant number of countries (Iatan 2021; Hussain et al. 2022). This indicates that there is a degree of satisfaction 
on the part of the customers involved. According to Mittal et al. (2021), businesses that sell their products or services 
to other businesses (B2B) invest a significant amount of resources to measure the level of satisfaction of their 
customers, but they do not receive adequate guidance on the implementation of satisfaction programs. Amin (2016) 
stated that customer satisfaction is the comparison result of customers' perceptions and expectations of services or 
products. As a result, it is essential to take note of the fact that Yang et al. (2023) reported that Amin (2016) described 
customer satisfaction accordingly.   
Iron ore is the primary raw material from which metallic iron is extracted to produce steel (Holmes et al. 2022), a 
crucial element in various industries including construction, shipbuilding, motor vehicle manufacturing (Shin and

Abstract 
Wireless charging, crucial in the pursuit of a sustainable future. However, the increasing reliance on traditional power 
generators to charge electric vehicles is placing an increasing burden on infrastructure and exacerbating the challenges 
of energy production. This pressing issue has intensified the need for alternative energy sources that can ease this 
pressure. This study proposes to design and implement a new power framework that utilizes the energy generated by 
the movement of cars for wireless charging. By integrating specialised chips into road infrastructure, we aim to capture 
the piezoelectric energy produced by moving cars and convert it into electrical energy to charge electric vehicles or 
for use in other areas such as running lightings on roads or homes. We will focus on the optimisation model through 
operations research. Which we determine the distribution of energy according to the needs of each type to obtain a 
quantity of energy at the lowest cost and reduce carbon emissions.

Abstract 
This research focuses on Lean implementation in manufacturing processes. It discusses different tools used to help in 
implementing this approach in any organization. Lean Six Sigma is now widely used all over the world and its 
principle is based on balancing between lean methods and six sigma’s Define-Measure-Analyse-Improve-Control 
(DMAIC) methodology. There are some important tools used in Lean Six Sigma, such as 5S, Value Stream Mapping, 
Single Minute Exchange of die, Systematic Plant Layout, and many other tools. The purpose of the research was to 
select suitable tools to be applied according to the needs of the company. This study applies Lean Six Sigma for food 
industry in t. The focus in this case study was on processed meat lines to make improvements on it. Tools like Value 
Stream Mapping, Single Minute Exchange of die and 5S were used to apply the improvements. After applying Single 
Minute Exchange of die, it was found that changeover time was reduced from 18 to 11 min, leading to an improvement 
almost equal to 38% in the total cycle time. For the automated line, a reduction from 10 to 5 min was achieved which 
represents improvement by 50% in the transportation time. By applying 5S training through kaizen planning, the 
workers worked faster, easier and in a tidy place. This led to reduce the unpacking cycle time to 8 min instead of 12 
min. Also, the lead time was reduced by 0.5% of the total lead time. The originality of this research is the application 
of lean manufacturing tools and value stream mapping in a complex production line of food industry, and thereby fills 
the gap between the theory and practice in the optimization of food production lines. This is a relatively new 
application area in the Middle East.

5. Conclusions and Future Work 
In this study, Lean tools, such as VSM,5S and SMED and the implementation of Lean with six sigma are addressed. 
Many industries use LSS implementation to improve their processes and efficiency. This study focuses on using LSS 
in a food factory located in the Middle East to solve its problems and reduce total time. After understanding the main 
process responsible of transforming raw meat into final product, VSM has been developed. Then time and flow of 
information and material is placed after collecting them through audits, stop watches, and visual observations. After 
drawing current state VSM. several problems were detected and investigated; filling process and unpacking of raw 
meat were chosen as a pilot zones. Lean tools, such as SMED ,5S and plant layout, were used to apply some 
improvements. 
 
After Appling these tools, the changeover time of the filling machine was reduced by 38% with improvement in 
internal task time by 72%, the automated line it makes a reduction of 50% in the transportation time, and the unpacking 
cycle time was reduced by 33%. So, here LSS is used through DMAIC principle as in the start of the case study 
brainstorming done with production manager to discuss the problems faced. Then measuring and analyzing data was 
done in the focused area through data analysis, Collection and Current VSM. Finally, improvement is done through 
some lean tools to improve the process and reduce cycle time. These improvements effect was observed through future 
state VSM.

Abstract 
This study explores healthcare operations management core challenges, a literature review was conducted by reading 
numerous secondary data sources, including government papers, industry reports, and scholarly literature. The 
findings were ten key challenges that are typically encountered by stakeholders in healthcare operations management. 
Those are resource allocation, cost control, patient flow and waiting times, data management and technology 
integration, regulatory compliance and quality assurance, staffing and workforce management, supply chain 
management, patient engagement and satisfaction, emergency preparedness and disaster management, encouraging 
a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. The results provide a significant contribution to the body of 
information already in existence by illuminating the recognized difficulties highlighting their complexities if not 
mitigated. The research question that this study aims to answer is “what is the most critical challenge faced in 
healthcare operations management”, based on the outcomes of the research, the relative weight of each challenge 
might change depending on the particular objectives and difficulties that a healthcare organization faces. Making it 
critical for them to take a balanced strategy that takes these aspects' interactions into account. In hospital operations 
management, a holistic approach that incorporates these variables is frequently the most successful technique. 
Prioritizing one area above others may not result in ideal outcomes thus, no one challenge can be considered more 
critical than the other.

Abstract 
Industrial information systems play a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency of operations in both industrial and 
service organizations. These systems facilitate the capture of data, execution of business processes, and monitoring of 
these processes, thereby streamlining operations. A crucial component of these systems is the database system, which 
allows for efficient storage, updating, and access to data. The integration of robust database systems within industrial 
information systems highlights their importance in ensuring seamless data management. The educational workshop at 
the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department, the College of Engineering at Sultan Qaboos University 
(SQU) is an integral part of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. It also provides substantial support for final 
year and research projects. However, the efficient management of information related to research devices, components 
used in these projects, and equipment usage presented a challenge. Recognizing this need, and as part of the Industrial 
Information System course project, we were motivated to develop a comprehensive database system. This system is 
designed not only to streamline information management but also to enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness 
of the workshop and its related resources. The specific objectives of this course project are threefold. Firstly, we aim 
to develop a high-level data model that accurately represents the data requirements of the workshop. The second 
objective is to create a relational data model that effectively organizes the data into a set of linked tables. Lastly, we 
aim to develop and rigorously test the workshop database to ensure its robustness and reliability.  
These objectives provide a clear and focused direction for the successful completion of the project, ensuring that the 
database system will effectively meet the needs of the workshop. The methodology followed to achieve the objectives 
of this project was systematic and thorough. It begins with gathering and analyzing data requirements, involving visits 
to the workshop, and conducting interviews with staff members to understand their needs. The next phase includes 
constructing an Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagram using Dia software, providing a visual representation of the data 
requirements. This E-R diagram is then reviewed with workshop representatives to ensure the suitability of the 
database design for their requirements. Once approved, the E-R model is mapped into a relational data model, forming 
the basis of the database's logical design. To ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy, the database design is then 
normalized. Following this, the relational data model is implemented in LibreOffice Base, a free and open-source 
database management system that can create databases and link between one another by function as a user interface 
thus offering a practical and user-friendly platform for data management. The final phase involves rigorous testing of 
the database, including data insertion and functionality checks to ensure its robustness and reliability. 
This project has successfully resulted in a preliminary database that efficiently meets the needs of the educational 
workshop. Through careful analysis and understanding of data requirements, we detailed the number and types of 
entities, their respective attributes and types, and the relationships between entities. An E-R diagram was constructed, 
graphically representing these elements. It comprises 13 entities and 32 relationships of unary, binary, and tertiary 
relationships. This E-R model was then transformed into a relational database model, which comprises a set of tables 
that are linked together by foreign keys which are primary keys in other tables, establishing new constraints and 
bounds between data of the related tables. Then implemented in LibreOffice Base. The final product is a

Abstract 
The ride-hailing industry has witnessed significant transformations globally, with companies increasingly recognizing 
the key role of knowledge as a strategic asset in creating and sustaining value. This research presents a case study 
focusing on Careem, a leading ride-hailing service, and its utilization of knowledge as a key driver for value creation 
within the specific context of Pakistan. Through a comprehensive analysis of Careem's strategies, operations, and 
market dynamics, we explore how the company leverages knowledge to address challenges, enhance services, and 
contribute to its success in the Pakistani market. 
Purpose – This research aims to highlight how knowledge can be handled to build innovative strategies and unravel 
the intricate ways by which knowledge is leveraged as a strategic asset for value creation within the ride-hailing 
industry. The study navigates through theoretical foundations, practical applications, and challenges encountered by 
Careem in its quest to associate knowledge for sustainable success. 
Design/methodology/approach – The core of research unfolds through an in-depth examination of a case study from 
the prominent ride-hailing service platform (Careem) in Pakistan, renowned for its innovative approaches and market 
leadership. This research spotlights how Careem strategically manages and applies knowledge to optimize operations, 
enhance customer experiences, and pioneer transformative changes in the transportation sector. Data are gathered 
through publicly available company information and interviews with Careem management, drivers, customers, and 
stakeholders. An explanation-building technique has been adopted for data analysis. 
Findings – Findings highlight three domains (knowledge, strategic, and value), arising from the market and societal 
needs along with technical progressions. First, the “knowledge domain”, where tacit, and explicit knowledge play

crucial roles in the operations and success of ride-hailing services like Careem. These two types of knowledge are 
often distinguished based on their nature and accessibility. While explicit knowledge (information) provides formal 
guidelines and procedures, tacit knowledge (experience) contributes to the intuitive decision-making and problem-
solving skills of drivers. Careem relies on a combination of tacit and explicit knowledge (actionable knowledge) for 
effective operation. The case of Careem shows that understanding the balance between two types of knowledge is 
crucial for developing strategies therefore knowledge-to-action cycle (knowledge capture, creation, sharing, and 
knowledge utilization) is discussed to enhance the operational efficiency of Careem`s services. 
Moreover, the “strategic domain” is where knowledge is the central part of Careem's strategic approach (making 
decisions, taking actions, and devising the best solutions). Careem has adopted multiple innovative strategies that can 
change over time based on market conditions, industry trends, and the company's evolving priorities as (1) Competitive 
localization: understanding and staying compliant with local regulations and culture in the regions (2) Learning 
organization: plan for entering new markets or expanding its services within existing markets (3) Boundary spanning: 
strategic partnerships with other companies, businesses, or local entities (4) Creating shared value (CSV) company: 
outlining its commitment to social and environmental responsibility in parallel with profitability, contributing to the 
communities it serves.  
Lastly, the “value domain” is the outcome of the strategic utilization of knowledge by Careem. It drives Careem's 
commitment to refining its services, processes, and technologies over time. Careem operates ethically and follows 
legal standards, ethical business practices, and responsible corporate behavior to create value for all the involved 
stakeholders (Careem itself, drivers, riders, investors, and 3rd parties) in its service transaction. 
Conclusion –The conclusion summarizes key findings from the case study, emphasizing the critical role of knowledge 
as a strategic asset for Careem in creating and sustaining value in the Pakistani market. It highlights the importance of 
adaptive strategies, customer-centric approaches, and effective knowledge management in navigating challenges and 
capitalizing on opportunities within the ride-hailing industry. The insights gained from this case study contribute to a 
broader understanding of how knowledge-driven strategies can shape success in dynamic and diverse markets. 
Originality/value – This research is the first attempt to conceptualize the essence of knowledge for creating value in 
the context of a ride-hailing platform.

Abstract 
The successful management of green supply chain management (GSCM) needs dedicated environmental principles 
and global benchmarking that can lead to a proactive strategy to improve environmental performance. The critical 
success factors (CSFs) play a significant role in accomplishing the implementation of strategy towards the defined 
objective/goal. The present research explores the CSFs for GSCM. The objectives are to diminish carbon footprint by 
implementing GSCM practices, reduce waste generation, and endorse sustainable sourcing through environmentally 
responsible practices. It also attempts to measure awareness regarding the significance of sustainable green supply 
chain practices and evaluate the CSFs based on their importance to GSCM. The questionnaire-based empirical analysis 
of the collected data was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v 23.0. The analyses reveal 
valuable insights into the CSFs responsible for GSCM. The research reveals the effectiveness and prioritization of 
CSFs in achieving GSCM. The manufacturing companies will benefit from the present findings to improve the product 
manufacturing cycle and accomplish GSCM.

1. Introduction
Green supply chain management (GSCM) supports green practices in supplier sourcing, materials management, 
manufacturing systems, material handling, packaging, warehousing, inbound and outbound logistics management and 
product distribution, throughout the supply chain until it reaches the customer. The GSCM helps in realising cost 
savings by optimizing the resources for lower energy consumption, material usage, and efficient eco-friendly 
manufacturing process selection. Thus, the GSCM can cut down the operational costs and provide cutting-edge for 
manufacturers to build competitive strategies to stay in the global market with enhanced market share. Nowadays, 
manufacturers adopt a proactive approach in adopting GSCM practices that can lead to better environmental 
performance to satisfy the stakeholder's demand and customers' needs by adopting green design, green supplier 
collaboration, green manufacturing, and recycling to accomplish circular economy for profit building.

Figure 6.  Mean and SD of CSFs 
 
The error bar plot Figure 6 provides insights into the variability of responses for each CSF. Longer error bars signify 
greater standard deviation, indicating a wider range of opinions among respondents. CSF6 (Lifecycle Assessment and 
Eco-design) stands out with a high mean score and relatively short error bars, suggesting that respondents generally 
agree on its importance with less variability. In contrast, CSF1 (Green Supply Chain Management Practices) has 
longer error bars, indicating a more diverse range of opinions on its significance. Figure 6  displays the mean and SD 
of CSFs. 
 
4.1 Discussion  
In the context of GSCM in Saudi Arabia, the identified CSFs hold significant implications for sustainable practices 
including sustainable procurement, energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption, green packaging and waste 
reduction, reverse logistics and product lifecycle management, environmental impact assessments, collaboration and 
partnerships, and continuous improvement and innovation. These factors drive integrating environmentally friendly 
practices into the supply chain, promoting sustainability, and reducing environmental impact. 
 
The study's findings, which emphasize collaboration, technology adoption, and continuous improvement in GSCM, 
align with well-established theoretical frameworks. Surprisingly, the strong emphasis on collaboration challenges the 
traditional ideas of transaction cost economics, highlighting the significance of relational contracting in the Saudi 
Arabian business context. The unexpected finding that ""Lifecycle Assessment and Eco-design"" is the most important 
factor for environmentally friendly supply chains in Saudi Arabia might be because companies there really care about 
reducing the impact their products have on the environment. This could be because the government has strict rules, 
consumers want eco-friendly products, and businesses see it as a way to stand out. To make this work, companies 
might need to learn more about eco-design, and the government could keep supporting businesses that are going green. 
Everyone in the industry should also work together and raise awareness of why eco-friendly products are important. 
 
However, it's important to acknowledge certain limitations in the study. Cultural biases in survey responses and the 
evolving nature of sustainability practices may affect the generalizability of the findings across all industries and 
business sizes in Saudi Arabia. To address these limitations, future research could explore the cultural influences on 
collaboration more deeply. This could involve investigating how cultural factors impact the way businesses in Saudi 
Arabia form relationships. Additionally, researchers could explore the specific challenges and opportunities for GSCM 
in different industries within the country. Furthermore, longitudinal studies could be conducted to track how effective 
these GSCM practices are over time. This would provide valuable insights into the sustainability and durability of the 
implemented strategies. Additionally, comparative studies with other regions could offer a broader. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the examination of CSFs for GSCM in Saudi Arabia provides valuable insights into the key 
determinants of successful sustainability practices. The research underscores the paramount significance of 
incorporating Lifecycle Assessment and Eco-design practices, as reflected in this study. Moreover, the study

emphasizes the pivotal role of Technology Adoption and Innovation, along with Continuous Improvement and 
Performance Evaluation, as critical drivers for fostering sustainability within the supply chain. However, the variable 
perceptions surrounding the overall importance of Green supply chain management practices (CSF1) suggest a need 
for further exploration to understand the factors contributing to this variability. Additionally, the challenges associated 
with cultivating a Green culture (CSF4) within organizations emerge as a notable area for consideration, emphasizing 
the importance of targeted efforts in shaping sustainable mindsets. These findings hold implications for both 
businesses and policymakers engaged in GSCM in Saudi Arabia, guiding strategic decisions and policy formulations 
to enhance sustainability practices within the evolving landscape of the supply chain. The dynamic nature of these 
factors emphasizes the need for ongoing research to deepen our understanding of their complexities and implications 
on sustainable business practices in the region.

Abstract 
Solid waste generation has witnessed a significant global upsurge, necessitating a shift from traditional handling 
methods to more intelligent approaches aligned with the contemporary paradigm of Industry 4.0(I4.0). Traditional 
techniques of solid waste management (SWM) pose challenges in adequately coping with the burgeoning volume, 
demanding the adoption of smarter solution. Achieving sustainability, encompassing economic, social, and 
environmental facets, is hindered by the persistent reliance on manual processes in waste management. This article 
aims to address these issues by conducting a systematic literature review on the application of I4.0 in SWM 
considering sustainability. This study also suggests a path for future research through in-depth content analysis. The 
findings contribute valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners and researchers aiming to develop strategies for 
intelligent and sustainable solid waste management in the current global landscape.

1. Introduction
In a period characterized by accelerated urbanization, augmenting population dimensions, and economic expansion, 
solid waste management (SWM) has emerged as critical global concern by 2050, with projections foreseeing an 
anticipated 3400 million tonnes of solid waste (SW) (Hashemi-Amiri et al., 2023). The rising SW rates lead to 
widespread dumping, adversely affecting property values and community well-being. Addressing these challenges 
requires integrating sustainability into SWM, which is crucial for source reduction, mitigating environmental 
pollution from disposal, promoting recycling, and promoting the harmonious development of humanity and nature 
(Pati and Agrawal, 2022; Yang et al., 2023). SW is categorized into various types, including electronic, municipal, 
hazardous, industrial, and, distinguished based on their sources and compositions. The synergistic application of 
Industry 4.0 (I4.0) alongside physio-chemical technologies elevates resource recoveries, ensuring effective 
management and yielding valuable outputs (Vyas et al., 2023). Leveraging I4.0 for efficient handling of value chain 
data for executing cognitive action and implementing at the local level not only enhance SWM but also contribute to 
sustainable economic growth (Chowdhury et al., 2022). In addition, it aspires to essentially convert conventional 
businesses into smart industry by bringing self-maintenance and personality traits, serving as the cornerstone of 
future network technologies where knowledge is intelligently transmitted and shared without human intervention. 
 SWM involves predicting SW generation, segregating waste, managing collection, transportation, and recycling. 
Addressing the intricacies of these processes can be achieved by employing computational designs that emulate

Abstract 
A work-study is a systematic examination of the methods used to complete tasks, intending to improve resource 
utilization and set performance standards for the activities being carried out. The application of this technology has 
considerable potential for improving productivity in management. By implementing method study and time study 
within an organization, it is feasible to achieve enhanced productivity at a lower expense, while concurrently 
enhancing the quality of the output. As a result, this results in increased levels of productivity. The main objective of 
this study is to reduce machine idle time, improve production efficiency, and mitigate worker fatigue. The objective 
of this study is to determine the standardized performance methods and cycle time required to maximize the efficiency 
of equipment and labour while minimizing excessive efforts and wasteful handling of materials. This study focuses 
on the production lines specifically involved in the manufacturing of dairy milk. There are four machining centres in 
the production line. The time study approach has been chosen as the methodology for quantifying labour. The present 
investigation was carried out at a dairy milk-producing plant to examine the application of time and work study 
approaches. This decision was prompted by the substantial quantity of unproductive time seen during the operation. 
After implementing the suggested measures for improvement, the company experienced a significant increase in 
productivity, namely by 27.77%. A refined flow process chart is suggested, derived from meticulous observations and 
in-depth talks with the company's manager.

1. Introduction
For a considerable period, work-study was commonly referred to as ""time and motion study"". However, as the 
technique evolved and found application in a diverse array of activities, a significant number of individuals began to 
perceive the previous terminology as too limited and lacking in descriptive adequacy. Productivity can be defined as 
the quantitative relationship between the output and input of a given process or system. The concept refers to a 
quantitative correlation between the output of our production and the corresponding expenditure incurred in the 
production process. The numerical value provided is 70. Productivity can be defined as the process of minimizing the 
inefficient utilization of various resources, such as labor, materials, machinery, time, space, and capital. The concept 
can be defined as the collective endeavors of individuals to enhance productivity by minimizing resource inputs, hence 
facilitating optimal distribution. According to the City Council, productivity might be seen as a mindset or attitude. 
The concept pertains to a mindset focused on advancing and enhancing existing elements. The ability to consistently 
improve upon one's previous performance is a definitive aspect of personal growth. The concept refers to the ongoing 
process of adapting economic and social activities in response to evolving circumstances. The application of novel 
approaches and methodologies necessitates a persistent and ongoing endeavor. The concept being referred to is the 
belief in the advancement of humanity. According to Peter Drucker, productivity refers to achieving a state of

6. Conclusion  
Work measurement encompasses two primary techniques: time study and motion study. In order to attain reliable 
outcomes, it is imperative to employ a combination of time and motion studies when doing work measurement. Prior 
to doing a time study, it is imperative to also take into account the motion study. Therefore, it may be argued that 
motion study serves as a fundamental framework for doing time study. As previously mentioned, time study is a 
method used to quantify the amount of time needed to complete a specific task by a predetermined process flow. The 
researchers conducted a study on bottleneck stations in order to reduce unnecessary time and enhance manufacturing 
output on the machine. The time required for each element was initially computed and afterward examined in order 
to identify any necessary modifications to be made to the machine. The examination of existing processes in a dairy 
milk-producing facility is conducted through the application of method study and layout techniques. Based on the 
preceding discourse, it can be inferred that the enhancement of the process may be achieved by the use of method 
study, optimization of work procedures, and effective usage of machinery. The proposed improvement has the 
potential to enhance the existing process by mitigating process complexity, lowering time requirements, and 
alleviating worker fatigue. Following the implementation of the recommended improvement strategies, the firm had 
a notable enhancement in production, with a significant rise of 27.77%.

Abstract 
The Pelemadu Rempeyek Industrial Center had a declining demand for peanut chips in 2020 until the research was 
done. Catfish chips becoming an alternative product to overcome the declining demand for peanut chips, they have 
high nutritional value and are easy to produce. This research was carried out by questionnaires and focus group 
discussions (FGD) to improve the design of catfish chips using the Kano model and quality function deployment 
(QFD). The results of the Kano model analysis show that the consumer requirements of catfish chips are a long time 
savage, ease of purchase, safe packaging, attractive design, clean packaging, and the variety of flavors offered. The 
results of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) show the important factors that must be considered in catfish chips to 
fulfill consumer requirements are the clarity of the oil used which has a contribution value of 17.66%, draining the oil 
with a spinner machine has a contribution value of 16.02%, the thickness of the catfish meat pieces has a contribution 
value of 15.22%, and the spices used have a contribution value of 9.37%. Thus, the Rempeyek Industrial Center must 
consider the type of cooking oil used which has high clarity, drain it after frying, and cut the catfish chips not too 
thickly. The design development of catfish chips in 100-gram packaging has a production cost of IDR 9.411 or rounded 
up to IDR 9.500. The consumers' willingness to buy is on average IDR 12.690, so the profit is IDR 3.190 for each 
package.

1. Introduction
The Pelemadu Rempeyek Industrial Center located in Imogiri, Bantul, Yogyakarta, is one of the regional centers of 
the peanut brittle industry which was founded in 1994. The Pelemadu Rempeyek Industrial Center has superior 
products, namely peanut chips, soybean chips, and sago chips. Tubilah, the owner of Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs) Pelemadu Rempeyek Industrial Center said that the problem currently was a significant decline 
in demand for peanut chips since 2020. The prices of peanuts as the raw material of chips fluctuate making the profits 
uncertain.Indonesia is the largest fish producer country in ASEAN, there are 21.87 million tons in 2021 and 28,43 
million tons in 2022 (Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries 2023). The national fish consumption in 2021 reached 
55.37 kg/capita. Maluku is the region with the highest fish consumption, it is 77.49 kg/capita. However, Yogyakarta 
is the region with the lowest fish consumption, it is 34.82 kg/capita (Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries 2022).

The estimated production costs are calculated for every 5 kg of fresh catfish. For every processing 5 kg of catfish, it 
can produce around 1.7 kg of chips. The equivalent of 17 packages per 100-gram packs of catfish chips. So, it can be 
seen that the cost of production for each 1 pcs of catfish chips is IDR 9.411 or rounded up to IDR 9.500.  
 
According to the results of 40 respondents, it can be seen that consumers' willingness to buy catfish chips products in 
100-gram packaging is on average IDR 12.690. With the basic production price of catfish chips per 100-gram package 
of IDR 9.500, the Pelemadu Rempeyek Industrial Center has made a profit of IDR 3.190 for each package. In practice, 
determining product selling prices can be adjusted to the environment and target market. For example, through the 
digitalpreneur which uses the internet as a medium for offering and buying and selling products. By marketing online, 
the product can increase the price sales and reach more consumers so the profit could increase too (Mazda et al 2023). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Kano model can be used as a tool for identifying consumer requirement attributes that fall into the attractive 
category, namely attributes that have a significant impact on consumer satisfaction. The attributes that consumers 
require that are included in the attractive category of catfish chips are last a long time, ease of purchasing the product, 
packaging safety, unique and attractive packaging design, and the variety of flavors offered. The technical 
characteristics that can be used as a priority in design with a contribution of 58.27% to fulfilling consumer desires

include the clarity of the cooking oil used, the use of a spinner draining machine, the thickness of the catfish meat 
pieces, and the spices used. Thus, the Rempeyek Industrial Center producers must consider the type of cooking oil 
used which has high clarity, and drain it after frying, as well as cutting the catfish not too thickly and the taste of 
catfish chips.  
 
The design development of catfish chips given the cost of production for each 1 pcs of catfish chips is IDR 9.411 or 
rounded up to IDR 9.500. The consumers' willingness to buy catfish chip products in 100-gram packaging is on 
average IDR 12.690, the producer has made a profit of IDR 3.190 for each package. In practice, determining product 
selling prices can be adjusted to the environment and target market. In practice, determining product selling prices can

Literature Review
Organizational culture is a basic concept in the field of management and organizations of all types and refers to the 
common beliefs, values, norms, symbols, procedures, and language patterns that shape the behavior and interactions 
of individuals within the organization. The collective mentality and patterns of behavior determine the identity and 
character of the organization, as organizational culture plays a crucial role in influencing employee behavior, decision-
making processes, and overall organizational performance (Bellot, 2011).

Abstract 
Hospital emergencies, which take care of patients who cannot be handled “on an outpatient basis”. This patient care 
is the most sensitive indicator of the health system's effectiveness. A comprehensive continuous improvement 
approach must be established, the first step of which is to identify the current state of the emergency department's 
operations. The objective is to analyze the activity of the Medical and Surgical Emergency Department (MSED), 
namely the hospitalization unit, and identify gaps. Conduct a quantitative assessment of the MSED hospitalization 
unit's activities in 2022 in order to understand its operations. The general organization of emergency services is known 
and described by regulations. At MSED, the work is divided according to distinct functional units (FU). Caregivers 
are divided into alternating teams, providing care all year round.  During 2022, the number of hospitalized patients 
was 23,435. The average daily admission was 217±20 patients, the average length of stay was 3.82±7.01 days. The 
average age was 38.12±26.42 years. These patients have multiple chronic diseases, the reason for admission is mainly 
ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, respiratory distress and pulmonary emboli.  The care pathway is considered long due 
to, on the one hand, the patients' age and polypathologies, and on the other hand organizational factors. The analysis 
of the care pathway and duration at the MSED showed interest in creating tools to improve quality of care and quality 
of work life. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The emergency department (ED) is often the first point of contact for patients entering the hospital. It is a critical 
service that must manage a high and unpredictable flow of patients with a variety of conditions. Thus, quality of care 
relies on optimizing patient reception and management in the ED. The phenomenon of ""long-stay hospitalizations"" is 
one of the main problems encountered in emergency departments. Many patients remain ""stuck"" in the ED, sometimes 
for several days, waiting for a bed due to the lack of available spots in hospitalization units.  
These prolonged hospitalizations, also known as ""bedblockers,"" have many negative effects. The patient's comfort is 
first affected. Remaining on a stretcher in a noisy intensive care area without privacy delays his/her recovery. 
Subsequently, this situation severely hinders the organization and fluidity of the emergency department. Due to the 
high number of patients waiting for beds in boxes and on stretchers, it is difficult to accommodate new arrivals. This 
leads to longer waiting times and an additional workload for staff. ED healthcare workers suffer from stress and 
professional burnout due to this situation.

These patients hospitalized for a long duration at MSED have multiple chronic illnesses (Table 2), and the main 
reasons for admission are primarily ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, respiratory distress, and pulmonary embolisms. 
Additionally, for elderly individuals, alterations in consciousness and general condition are common 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Patients admitted to the MSED hospitalization unit have a lengthy care journey due, on one hand, to the age and 
severity of the patients' illnesses, and on the other hand, to organizational factors and working conditions (staffing and 
lack of equipment). Optimizing hospitalization processes would therefore help streamline the patient's journey the 
emergency department and improve conditions for both caregivers and patients 
 
6. Conclusion  
This saturation of emergency services contributes to user dissatisfaction. Endless waiting times, dehumanized care... 
The lived experience degrades the image of public service in the eyes of patients.

Abstract 
Background: The nursing staff experiences a high psychological burden in the care setting, as well as a mental or 
cognitive strain; Psychiatric violence is one of the acknowledged health risk factors associated with psychosocial 
conditions at work; The Leymann model (Leymann Inventory Psychological Terror, or ""LIPT"") is the primary model 
used to evaluate this factor that has been identified by the scientific literature. The goal of this study was to assess the 
frequency of psychological violence at work and to suggest a preventive strategy tailored to the risks that have been 
identified. 
Materials and Methods: A working population of 1338 caregivers who agreed to engage in a descriptive cross-
sectional study served as the basis for this study. In this study, 658 men and 680 women who were employed in a 
public hospital system in 2010 participated in an interview and answered the Leymann's inventory self-questionnaire. 
Results: The LIPT makes it possible to assess the prevalence of exposure to 45 types of bullying during a 12-month 
period. According to Leymann's definition, the prevalence of violence is 4.5%, of which 57.64% were still 
experiencing harassment at the time of the survey; in the great majority of these cases, the aggressor is a superior in 
the hierarchy; also, the aggressor is more frequently a coworker for women than a male. 
Conclusion: The results of our study highlight, through a validated international instrument, that exposure to 
psychological violence at work risks altering the well-being of our healthcare staff.

Abstract 
This study examines the efficacy of the Quality Management System in a paint manufacturing setting, with a specific 
emphasis on reducing both internal and external defects. The research examines the dedication of senior management, 
the correlation between cost and quality, and obstacles to the sustainable operation of the Quality Management System 
(QMS) in order to tackle the ongoing problem of faulty products. The study employs a mixed-method approach, 
combining quantitative analysis of employees' perspectives from different branches with qualitative evaluation of 
internal rejects and customer complaint processes. The findings indicate that there are varied opinions about the level 
of dedication from senior management towards the Quality Management System. It is also evident that there are 
significant financial consequences associated with quality failures. Additionally, there are notable obstacles that hinder 
the long-term viability of the QMS, such as employees' comprehension and training. Suggested measures involve 
increasing the involvement of senior executives, enhancing the training program for Quality Management System, 
and establishing well-defined channels for communication. Future research should expand the range and 
comprehensiveness of Quality Management System (QMS) studies, investigating different models and their influence 
on staff training, commitment from leadership, and organizational culture in order to strengthen the effectiveness of 
QMS.

1. Introduction
Every year, the market experiences a number of product recalls and consumer advisories concerning manufactured 
goods that display notable defects (Mukherjee et al. 2021; Nicol 2021). These products, which have been identified 
as potentially dangerous or not meeting the established quality standards, need to be removed from the market. 
Afterward, they are sent back to the manufacturing entity for either replacement or refund, guaranteeing consumer 
safety and compliance with quality standards. Wolniak (2019) and later Sanchez-Lizarraga et al. (2020), creating a 
management system based on the criteria of International Organization and Standardization (ISO) 9001 offers a basis 
for an organization to define customer requirements and use the principles of customer focus, process approach and 
evidence-based decision-making to meet and develop these requirements and improve (Salim et al. 2019), therefore 
countering the production of defective products. This implies that the organization has guaranteed that the client 
requirements are identified and that the structure of the item meets the necessities. The controls, screens and measures 
are the procedures utilized all through the company to ensure they are working as arranged, if not to address any issues 
(Mok and Chowdhury 2019).

Abstract 
The Earth, a complex and interconnected system, faces an imminent threat from climate change, exacerbated by 
escalating carbon emissions. The Philippines addressed air quality concerns with the Clean Air Act of 1999, 
emphasizing mobile sources like vehicles. This paper proposed a catalytic converter prototype incorporating zeolite 
to assess its efficiency in reducing carbon emissions. Employing an experimental approach, the study utilizes t-tests 
as a statistical tool to compare carbon emissions between vehicles with and without the zeolite-based catalytic 
converter and value analysis and value engineering to optimize the production process and reduce costs. Based on the 
obtained results, ""Z-Lite'' is a profitable alternative exhaust filter for diesel engines, showcasing its potential to reduce 
carbon emissions significantly. The statistical analysis, yielding a low p-value, supports the hypothesis that zeolite 
filters effectively reduce carbon emissions. With over 100 emission centers in the Philippines, the marketability of Z-
Lite in Marikina City underscores its practicality in addressing environmental concerns and promoting sustainable 
practices in the transportation industry. The integration of value analysis and value engineering ensures that it is both 
environmentally friendly and affordable, making it a promising and sustainable choice for mitigating the 
environmental impact of diesel engine emissions.

1. Introduction
Earth is such a complex domain, as it persists in requiring different things to maintain its harmony. However, 
everything that people should ensure does have a significant impact on the environment. According to research 
undertaken by Weiskopf (2020), climate change poses a widespread and escalating worldwide menace to biodiversity 
and its ecosystems. As climate change constitutes a surging combination worldwide throughout the dominion, this 
particular phenomenon impacts individual species, influencing their interactions with other animals and habitats. 
Consequently, this spearheads modifications in the structure and functioning of ecosystems and the provision of 
products and services by natural systems to civilization (Díaz et al., 2019).  
The amount of carbon emissions trapped in the atmosphere contributes to the worsening case of climate change in the 
domain. Several harmful effects on the environment, human and animal life, and the future of the populace, including 
melting the polar ice caps, rising sea levels, disruption of animal habitats, and extreme weather events, are also 
contained within this dilemma. 
Since transport is one of the fastest growing sectors contributing to emissions, using catalytic converters on vehicles 
shows a practical approach to lessen the harmful pollutants. The researchers proposed further improving the catalytic 
converter's efficiency by incorporating it as a zeolite, creating an emission filter for automotive vehicles. The natural

A comparison of value analysis and value engineering of the current and proposed catalytic converter is shown in 
Table 3, along with its reasoning. The study reveals that by utilizing value engineering and analysis, ""Z-Lite"" 
demonstrates a substantial foundation for maximizing its exhaust filter's design, functionality, and cost. Through these 
approaches, the proponents want to present a reasonably priced remedy that not only efficiently lowers carbon 
emissions from diesel engines but also has a beneficial effect on the environment and the economy. Z-Lite is a viable 
option for long-term and significant diesel engine pollution management because of its modular design, low cost, and 
emphasis on excellent filtration and catalysis. 
 
4. Conclusions  
This study discovered Z-Lite to be a viable alternative exhaust filter for diesel engines, potentially significantly 
lowering carbon emissions and improving air quality. When included, Z-Lite efficiently filters out hazardous 
pollutants, reducing the adverse environmental effects of diesel engines. It highlights Z-Lite's potential as a valuable 
remedy for mitigating ecological issues related to diesel engine exhaust, enhancing overall air quality. It has also been 
revealed that zeolite is an adequate alternative exhaust filter for lowering carbon emissions from diesel engines. Its 
marketability in Marikina City emphasizes its applicability and utility in resolving environmental challenges and 
promoting sustainable habits, as evidenced by the more than 100 emission centers in the Philippines.

Abstract 
The global energy landscape has long relied on the oil and gas sector, a vital industry heavily dependent on an intricate 
web of pipelines, barges, and diverse transportation networks. This study delves into the pressing safety concerns 
within the oil and gas domain, specifically addressing transportation-related incidents, which notably exhibit a higher 
fatality rate compared to other aspects. Employing the Six Sigma methodology, this research endeavors to scrutinize 
and bolster the safety protocols within the land transportation sector of the UAE's oil and gas industry. Various 
analytical approaches are utilized to unearth the root causes of these issues, subsequently enabling comprehensive 
investigations and effective mitigation strategies. Drawing data from the International Association of Oil and Gas 
Producers (IOGP), committed to curbing land transportation accidents, insights are gathered from a wide spectrum of 
global oil and gas entities, including local firms in the UAE. Through the application of Six Sigma principles, the 
findings underscore that human factors, encompassing diverse facets, stand as the primary catalysts behind land-based 
incidents plaguing the industry. This study signifies a significant step toward identifying and rectifying critical safety 
concerns, ultimately striving for a safer operational environment within the oil and gas transportation sphere. The 
results of FMEA identified inadequate training for unusual situations as a major human factor in land transportation 
incidents, with the highest RPN of 504. After analysis, a significant 57.14% reduction in RPN was achieved, supported 
by statistical validation confirming the effectiveness of recommended actions in reducing severity and overall risk.

Introduction
Transportation methods differ based on the material to be transported, the material`s physical status, cost, available 
resources, etc. In the oil and gas industry, most transportation activities are on land using trucks vehicles, or pipelines. 
Although transport using pipelines is a reasonably safe method, it has had its share of risks throughout history. Factors 
contributing to pipeline failures have been studied and identified for safer and more effective systems, including 
corrosion, damage related to equipment and operations, in addition to natural or outside force damage. A clear 
understanding of historical events will guide successful planning for the future; by investigating several unfortunate 
disasters resulted from pipeline failure, vandalism was found to be the root cause of pipeline failure, accounting for

The statistical validation strongly suggests that the actions recommended in the FMEA effectively reduced the severity, 
occurrence, and risk priority number of potential failure modes. 
 
5.3 Challenges 
The implementation of such innovative technologies such as ADAS requires a heavy investment of money from car 
manufacturers. Nonetheless, any error in the testing phase would require an update on the whole software (Kaur, P., & 
Sobti, R, 2017). So, the main challenging issue for ADAS would be in terms of cost; softwares in industry face challenges 
in adoption, in comparison to the current implementation (Wiese et al., 2018). AI-driven sensors are usually within all 
autonomous vehicles. Such vehicles reduce risks and any damage related to human factors; however, it does need the 
process of huge data of different parameters, such as different types of vehicles, weather conditions, other road users, 
etc. (El Makhloufi, 2023). From the human-related aspect, adjusting flexible working hours for employees would 
positively affect their mental health; however, addressing employees' mental health requires more than that; it requires 
solid programs for all individuals in the company, and the barrier here would be the low level of awareness, as some 
people tend to underestimate the importance of good mental health. Lastly, the use of pipelines in the oil and gas industry 
as a replacement for land transport is not 100% applicable depending on the material being transported, and it requires 
several approvals for pipeline construction, in addition to operation costs and maintenance (Wang et al., 2022).  
 
6. Conclusion 
In summary, this study used the Six Sigma methodology to identify human factors as the main contributors to safety 
issues in the UAE's oil and gas land transportation sector. Achieving objectives through a systematic Lean Six Sigma 
approach, the research highlighted trends in work-related fatalities based on data from the International Association of 
Oil and Gas Producers. Proposed control strategies include training, communication protocols, and technological 
advancements. The study offers valuable insights for stakeholders working towards accident prevention and 
environmental protection in oil and gas transportation.

Abstract 
This research aims to design ergonomic footwear catering to the comfort, safety, and well-being of elderly 
women by considering their different anatomical characteristics. We collected anthropometric foot 
measurements from 25 elderly women in Sharjah, UAE, the results showed consistent dimensions, 
particularly within the 95th percentile. By comparing the data with existing studies, the proposed interior 
shoe dimensions were validated, and ethnic differences were highlighted. Several adjustable features were 
recommended, including stretchable materials, removable insoles, and closure mechanisms. We propose a 
shoe design that integrates key components such as a low heel height, a sloped heel, a wide rigid sole, 
stretchable materials, and an adjustable closure. Among the most important considerations in elderly 
footwear design were proper fit, cushioning, breathability, slip resistance, arch support, and durability. 
Developing ergonomic footwear tailored to elderly women's needs based on this research paves the way for 
developing safe, comfortable, and well- being-promoting footwear.

1. Introduction
Ergonomic footwear plays a crucial role in enhancing the comfort and safety of individuals, particularly the 
elderly population. As we age, our feet undergo various structural changes, affecting our overall well-being 
and quality of life. There is a pressing need to address these issues and create footwear that caters 
specifically to the needs of elderly women. Elderly women represent a significant portion of the global 
population, and they often face numerous challenges related to mobility, balance, and musculoskeletal 
health. The feet are critical components of mobility and body support, and they are susceptible to age-
related changes, including reduced elasticity, muscle strength, and joint flexibility. Furthermore, older 
women may experience foot conditions such as osteoarthritis, bunions, hammertoes, and other issues that 
can be escalated by improper footwear. Ergonomics presents an unmet challenge in developing specialized 
footwear that enhances elderly women's safety and comfort. As individuals age, they experience a range of 
anatomical and physiological changes, and the feet, being the foundation of mobility, are significantly 
affected. Elderly women face heightened vulnerability to discomfort, instability, and an increased risk of 
falls, injuries, and pain due to the unsuitability or poor design of their footwear. These issues have a 
significant impact on their overall quality of life and well-being.   This research project aims to address this 
issue by focusing on the creation of ergonomically optimized footwear. The primary objective is to design 
footwear that not only accounts for the unique anatomical characteristics of elderly women's feet but also 
prioritizes their safety and comfort. The methodology involves the collection of anthropometric data from

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this research project addresses the crucial need for ergonomically optimized footwear for elderly 
women, aiming to enhance comfort, safety, and overall well-being. The study collected anthropometric data from 
elderly women in Sharjah, UAE, emphasizing the 95th percentile in designing footwear for optimal comfort. The 
study's results demonstrated consistency and validity, confirming the importance of this study. Throughout the study, 
we prioritized ethical considerations for the elderly participants. A strong focus on protecting privacy was placed on 
obtaining explicit permission and informed consent before collecting anthropometric data. We created an 
environment that respects participants' well-being during measurements by prioritizing their comfort. After 
analyzing the anthropometric measurements obtained, a footwear design was proposed. It highlights key design 
considerations, including heel height, slope, and width, as well as the importance of a wide and rigid sole. 
Adjustability features such as stretchable materials and various closing mechanisms were explored to fit individual 
preferences and foot conditions. Footwear's slip-resistance characteristics were emphasized as well, highlighting the 
importance of high slip-resistant soles and regular maintenance to avoid slipping accidents. The findings of this study 
offer valuable insights and practical recommendations for developing ergonomic footwear for elderly women. By 
combining anthropometric data, design considerations, and adjustability features, the suggested footwear aims to 
enhance the daily lives of elderly women. These findings can be further developed to improve ergonomic footwear 
for diverse populations and specific conditions in the future. To be more specific, it would be useful for future 
studies to test whether users of the chosen demographic would want to buy such a shoe as the one designed in this 
study. In addition, the shoe design developed in this study incorporated design features that would make the shoe fit 
comfortably for elderly women with different foot conditions. Future studies could build upon the findings of this 
study perhaps by researching the dimensions and design features preferred by groups of elderly women who are 
facing different foot conditions. For example, a shoe design targeted specifically for elderly women with swollen 
feet, and another design for elderly women with arthritis could be created. This will ensure meeting the needs of the 
individuals facing a specific foot condition better. Future studies could also research the dimensions and features 
most suitable for the elderly male population. Lastly, it would be useful if shoe manufacturers could take into 
consideration the design features established by this study and any future studies in developing their future shoe 
products to better meet the needs of the elderly population.

Beyond Boundaries- Circular Economy in Plastics 
Hareem Arshad

Abstract 
Research on plastics has a long tradition. Despite of its versatile nature, its chemical properties specifically non-
biodegradable nature of the conventional plastics makes this useful resource a burden on the overall health of the 
economy. The wastage from the plastics is often being dumped in the land, in the ocean or being incinerated which 
eventually rises the greenhouse gas emissions and increases the carbon footprints (Plastic Europe). From the year, 2000 
until 2019, global plastic waste production doubled, reaching a total of 353 million tonnes. In the plastic industry, 
single use plastics highlight the difficulties in moving from the linear economy to the circular economy. According to 
the study conducted b, single use plastics symbolises the concept of linear economy which is all about using the product 
and later throw it away.  A significant portion, approximately two-thirds, originates from plastics with lifetimes of less 
than five years. Among these, 40% comes from packaging, 12% from consumer goods, and 11% from clothing and 
textiles. Plastics have become deeply entrenched in daily commerce and exchanges, which in itself is the challenge for 
the businesses and other entities to decrease its usage because of the fact that their entire infrastructure and operational 
practices are connected with it. 
The lucrative growth of the single use plastic packaging is often associated with its functional characteristics such as 
its potential in decreasing the transportation costs, supporting firms in exporting, and trading the products as well as 
protecting food and other items from damage and contamination. 
These concerns about waste from plastic, give prompt revival to the unpackaged movement which is about developing 
new markets and consumer acceptance towards it. Some of the studies offered a mixed perspective about plastics and 
circular economy and if this unpackaged movement which is about the removal of single use plastics, has any relation 
with reduced consumption as a concern for circular economy. 
Europe generates almost 26 million tonnes of plastic waste each year, and the amount is rapidly increasing. For decades, 
researchers are trying to find the innovative ideas and technical ways to prevent the world from pollution resulted from 
plastics. One of the ways to decrease plastics pollution is by considering the concept of circular economy. Even though 
there is an extensive body of research in the context of circular economy and clean technologies, still there exists a gap 
when it comes to understanding the development of these concepts in the context of packaging. There is a need to find 
a way to make plastic packaging production methods less intensive with respect to energy efficiency and material 
consumption. In addition to that in the literature circular economy and plastics are generally discussed from the social 
and political perspective instead of technological lens. Therefore, more research is needed to see how plastic packaging 
how plastic packaging can adapt and integrate new technologies to advance the development of a circular economy. 
Hence, this research will try to fill this gap by considering different case studies from the plastic packaging industry. 
The aim of this study is to better understand the concept of circular economy in plastic industry with the support of 
cases from the industry. The main focus will be on the new business models particularly on the critical actors involved 
in these models, who gain who loss, target audience, level of circularity (with respect to R’s) and enablers for circular 
economy.

Abstract 
Korean Culture disseminates rapidly across the globe. The young generation is highly engaged in Korean trends, such 
as Korean pop music, dramas or movies, fashion, food, and beauty standards. With the use of media, the effects of 
Korean trends may have resulted in the effects of media on people and society such as addiction, perceptual influence, 
psychological effect, time consumption, and impulsive spending. The study aimed to determine whether there is a 
relationship between variable factors affecting the student's academic performance. The proponents used a quantitative 
approach in the 388 participants at the Technological Institute of the Philippines. This study shows that the Korean 
Trends and the Effect of Media on People and Society correlated to its variable factors. Moreover, this study may help 
future research in colleges and universities in the Philippines about how the students in higher education who engage 
in Korean Trends affect their behavior and academic performance.

Korean Trends, Academic Performance, Effect of Media on People and Society, and Addiction 
1. Introduction
Students have been impacted by Korean culture as a result of its global popularity. These Korean trends have become 
a worldwide phenomenon in the age of globalization and the internet. This has led to a devoted fan base actively 
participating in different facets of Korean culture. Filipinos have great flexibility of adaptability as they easily embrace 
these trends. Generations of students are part of this generational trend and the researcher aims to provide data on how 
academic performance is being affected by their behavior according to their hobbies (Korean Culture). 
Currently, Filipino youngsters who are the majority of students are the major members influenced by the Korean 
'fever' due to the Korean wave's globalization through the media. The content of K-pop which displays young attractive 
men and women, as well as the creative creation of Korean dramas that intentionally meet the standards of its target 
viewers, mainly the younger audience. The degree to which Filipino students engage with Korean culture may have 
two effects on their academic performance. One way to look at it is that this involvement could be inspirational and 
educational in terms of culture. Conversely, it might result in decreased academic achievement because fandom 
activities take up study time and cause distractions. 
The study aims to analyze how Korean trends impact the academic performance of students by applying the 
quantitative approach which serves as a tool to validate these effects. It is identified that most students engage in social 
media wherein Korean trends have always been the top content creators, as well as the most followed idols and actors. 
Students tend to spend their time scrolling on social media which draws them into an addiction that distracts their 
performance as well as strains their productivity in school (Munene & Nyaribo, 2013). On the other hand, it is also 
highlighted by Ko et al. (2014) that when it comes to the Korean Wave, there's no doubt that the media plays a 
significant role in its immense popularity. Simultaneously, it fosters a sense of escapism for its fans. Therefore, the 
objective of this study is to investigate and understand the Korean trends of the students, such as watching

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Based on the findings and conclusion of the study, the following recommendations are proposed: 
 
Awareness campaigns: Educational institutions might run awareness campaigns aimed at educating students about 
the potential repercussions of being exposed to Korean trends for an extended period of time.  
 
Balancing academic life and leisure activities: Educational institutions can encourage students to find a balance 
between their academic and leisure activities. This can be accomplished by giving students the chance to participate 
in extracurricular activities like athletics, the arts, or community service that have something to do with Korean trends. 
 
Curriculum Integration: Educational institutions may find it beneficial to students' motivation and interest in these 
trends by integrating Korean trends into their educational programs. 
 
Counseling Services: Educational institutions have the capacity to offer counseling services to students who may be 
experiencing issues with addiction, excessive spending, or time consumption associated with Korean trends.  
 
Undertaking Additional Research: Additional investigation is warranted to dig deeper into the correlation between 
Korean trends and academic performance. Research that examines the effects of particular Korean trends on academic 
achievement, experimental research, or longitudinal studies can all fall under this category.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the statistical results, it appears that Korean trends do not directly influence academic performance. 
Statistical calculations show that contrary to original predictions, Korean trends have no direct impact on these 
students' performance in school. This important finding highlights the variety of cultural phenomena' influence on 
academic performance and suggests that students' broad exposure to Korean culture need not be detrimental to their 
academic success. 
 
A closer look at the data reveals a weak but positive relationship between the amount of time students spend watching 
Korean media and certain demographic variables including age, year level, and weekly allowance. This association 
shows that although there is some relationship between the socioeconomic status of the students and their exposure to 
Korean culture, it has little bearing on their academic achievement. On the other hand, a more robust positive 
association was found between students' engagement with Korean trends and their perceptions of the impact of Korean 
media on society. Although it has no direct bearing on academic achievement, this relationship shows how important 
cultural involvement is in forming students' social experiences and identities. 
 
This study's limitations include its dependence on self-reported data, which could be biased, and its focus on higher 
education students, which might prevent it from applying to other demographic groups. Furthermore, although the 
quantitative technique is helpful in finding connections, it falls short in examining the qualitative components of 
students' interactions with Korean culture and the complex ways in which these interactions affect their personal and 
academic lives. 
 
In conclusion, by demonstrating the intricate and nuanced relationship between students' engagement with Korean 
culture and their educational achievement, this research adds to the continuing conversation about the effects of global 
cultural trends on academic performance. It demands more investigation into the qualitative aspects of this 
involvement and its consequences for practice and policy in education.

Abstract 
There are many factors (ie age, noise level, shift, temperature) surrounding a person while working, causing difficulty 
in evaluating their productivity. This research aims to develop the relation between age, shift as well as noise level 
and worker productivity rate in an automotive machining shop and give company improvement suggestions on how 
to improve the worker productivity. Consequently, this research will help the company to maximize the productivity 
of their production line.  Method used for this project was 2 x 3 factorial experimental design. The scope for the 
research was CNC Machining Shop, Mass-pro design with U shape conveyor, manual loading and unloading work 
type, cycle time at 2.0 min with constant temperature of 32.2 °C, Humidity at 56% and 300 Lux. The research found 
that, among all three factors, only age was significant to productivity. Based on this research, younger workers were 
more productive by 3.1% as compared to older workers. The 3.1% acted as reference for employers in the production 
line to rotate their men, by putting older manpower at lower demands production line and younger manpower at higher 
demands production line.

1. Introduction
Productivity is an important yet complex issue which can help in cost reduction and increase efficient resource usage 
(Nestor et al. 2019).  But the definition of productivity is simple, which is the ratio between output and input (Puspita 
Andriyanti 2007). Widespread opinion assumes older workers are less productive, but research showed that older 
workers experience often compensates for any physical disadvantages Viviani (2019). Getting older also brings in 
wisdom and knowledge to people, which can make him better at his job in other ways Axel Börsch-Supan And 
Matthias Weiss (2013) . The production department often needs strong, fast, and flexible workers, yet those things 
usually get weaker with age.  
In addition, a better work environment will lead to better productivity and performance (Arminas, Nurwahidah and 
Ahdan 2020). Loud distractions and high noises reduce productivity. Noise affects productivity. Moreover, workers 
will experience more fatigue during night shift which reduces productivity (Iwan M Ramdan, 2007). Planning, 
conducting, and analyzing the results of experiments were done using the Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, in

reducing noise can increase productivity. In regard to the author's experience working in the production line, neither 
the current management nor the previous one conducted any research on the connection between noise levels and 
output. The impact of noise on workers' health was the only thing that was known, not how it affected their 
productivity. Therefore, further research can be conducted to comprehend the connection between noise and 
productivity, particularly in a mass-production automotive machining shop. 
 
According to Figure 1 and the ANOVA at Table 3, shift had no significant impact on productivity. According to Table 
2, the mean productivity during day shift was 96.4% with 93.1% at minimum and 99.3% at maximum while the mean 
productivity at night shift was 97.8% with 90% at minimum and 100% at maximum. The literature that was reviewed 
did not support this. Based on literature, night shift workers are less productive. The author had never before 
investigated the effects of shift work on productivity but based on his experience working in the production line, some 
validity can be found in the findings of the reviewed literature because weariness and drowsiness, quality problems, 
mistakes, and defects typically increase during the night shift. The lower productivity during the night shift can be 
attributed to these quality issues, errors, and defects. Therefore, more research can be conducted to comprehend the 
relation between productivity and shift, particularly in an automotive machining shop with mass production settings. 
  
For shift factor, the result found was not aligned with the reviewed literature could be due to the short period of this 
research. If this research was done for longer period, the result could be different.  
 
5.4 Suggestion to Company 
Based on the author’s experience in production line, here are the suggestions that the author would like to recommend 
to the company to improve their productivity, 
1. Re do their time study for the line, but using the average of multiple age group as the standard. 
2. Use automation improvement to help in reducing the workload. 
3. Rotate their men. Put old workers at low volume lines and young workers at high volume line. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Age is significant towards productivity while the other two factors, Shift and Noise Level, are not significant. Younger 
workers are 3.1% more productive than older workers. Based on the author's experience in managing production shifts, 
it is evident that older workers get tired easily than younger workers when their jobs involve a lot of physical labor. 
Regression analysis of the data demonstrated the validity of this result. Suggestions were also given to the company 
to improve their productivity. 
 
The author would like to suggest a few improvements to improve the research outcomes. 
1. Control more factors. Despite being the same in both work areas, the environment in this research is 
uncontrollable. Tiny changes in the variables under control may have an impact on the outcomes. 
2. Apply a multiple level factor. The author's coded approach for this research has two levels for the factors, 
denoted by the codes +1 and -1. If the factors—noise at 70, 75, 82, 90, and 100 dB and age at 20, 25, 30, 35, 
and 40 years old, the outcome may not be as clear-cut as ""younger workers are more productive."" Better 
worker selection will be possible because of increased precision. 
3. Include responses that specifically address the worker's health, such as oxygen saturation and heart rate. 
These data allow for a more thorough analysis of the relation between the environment, health and physical 
factors.

Abstract 
Small and Medium Enterprises play a crucial role in growing the economy of developing, emerging, and developed 
countries. With South Africa experiencing the highest unemployment rate, SMEs are known for eradicating that and 
bringing about innovation. Digitalisation has led enterprises and people to generate massive big data that can be used 
for gaining insights, making predictions, descriptions, and prescriptive. The use of big data can increase the revenue 
and productivity of the enterprise. Big enterprises often manage to adopt and implement big data as they have the 
resources to do so. Unfortunately, SMEs are reluctant to adopt and implement due to limited resources. For enterprises 
to embrace big data they should have a roadmap that they will follow. This study followed a bibliometric analysis 
where Scopus databases were used for analysis are 118. The purpose of the bibliometric analysis was to outline the 
research trends for the adoption of big data by SMEs following the TOE framework theory for the past 5 years dating 
from 2019. Network, overlay, and density visualisation are outlined in this study. Together with coauthorship. It was 
found that Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Australia are leading with the number of publications. South Africa is in the 
top 12 countries that have contributed more. It is recommended that there must be support for scholars in the discipline. 
Future studies should focus on action research where the TOE framework theory is tested for its effectiveness when 
adopted and implemented by SMEs implementing big data analytics.

Introduction
Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) also known as Small, Micro, and Medium Enterprises play a very crucial role in 
growing the economy of any country, including developing emerging and developed (Chiromo, 2019). China, the 
United States of America, and Europe contribute a lot to exporting goods (Truong 2022). They contribute over 60% 
to the economy globally. As they are celebrated in different countries for their contribution to job creation, economic 
growth, and improving the standard of living of people, they also encounter a myriad of challenges where they operate.

with links of 3 (Malaysia, Italy, and France), and total link strength is 4, documents 7, and an average publication per 
year is 2021.86.  
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Countries such as South Africa are contributing to the body of knowledge through research. It is in the top 12 globally, 
however, a lot still needs to be done to increase the research contribution. There is a call for impactful research that 
will be cited by many people. What will lead to this collaboration with leading authors from other countries? The must 
be incentives for scholars who co-author with international leading scholars. They must be awarded for top cited in 
the topic understudy. This will encourage academics to write impactful research and to collaborate with the right 
scholars. The National Research Foundation (NRF) which is a national foundation should facilitate the awards, and 
administration related to NRF. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The research in the adoption of big data analytics by SMEs using the TOE framework has gained momentum. 
Recommendations have been made that SMEs should adopt TOE as a framework theory for basing the adoption of 
big data analytics. It is worth noting that the TOE framework theory is used when engineers and entrepreneurs want 
to adopt the implement big data analytics. The growth in the publications in the Scopus databases shows that 
researchers are writing about this topic. During COVID-19 times the has been a sharp growth of the research in this 
discipline. This is a result of lockdowns and the number of data created during that time as many people did most of 
the things on the internet. The country under study, South Africa is in the top 12 countries that have contributed 
significantly to this country. However, it remains the lowest contributor on the top 12 list. The country can do more 
in terms of increasing publication because it has a high number of SMEs and this presents an opportunity for more 
research. Furthermore, South Africa has a presidential task team on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is worth noting 
that the Fourth Industrial Revolution includes big data. They should be invested energy in the adoption of big data by 
SMEs and research should be done on this topic. Future studies should focus on action research where the TOE 
framework theory is tested for its effectiveness when adopted and implemented by SMEs implementing big data 
analytics.

Abstract 
The problems faced nowadays are due to the quick advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning 
models, giving rise to an alarming trend of deepfake audio scams; posing financial risks, job security threats, and 
disinformation hazards, as well as political influence. The purpose is to improve voice authenticity and 
trustworthiness during calls, as this research tackles the critical need for safeguarding communication against 
deepfake scams, whilst making the public aware of this uprising issue. The methodologies used in this research 
focus on the integration of a deepfake detection model into the Jitsi open- source web communication application. 
The detection model has an audio feature extraction engine (using libraries from python like pyaudio and librossa) 
that will obtain features like mccf from raw audio data and transform it into a dataframe. It will then be fed into a 
machine learning model. The ML model will be an XGBoost, as it is good for extract intricate patterns from audio 
data. This makes it reliable for real time audio monitoring as well as helping in eliminating latency. which will aid 
in spontaneous identification of deepfake voices. An awareness game in the front end will be created to educate 
users the difference between a genuine and a manipulated voice. The results and the implications expected from 
this research extend to mitigating the global prevalence of deepfake frauds, thus emphasizing the important role of 
AI in addressing the evolving deceptive practices and contributing to a safer digital communication environment.

Abstract 
The accumulation of supply chain lead time caused by inventory handling inside the warehouse, which includes waiting 
time, queue time, and unexpected delays, makes it difficult to fulfill demand shocks and third-party stakeholder needs. 
Regardless of how complex production planning is, these issues persist and change. In that instance, studying or 
mapping a pharmaceutical warehouse supply chain inventory would be a significant difficulty in identifying areas for 
future development. The study focused on the warehouse of a pharmaceutical firm. Following extensive fieldwork and 
literature gap analysis, a case study technique was determined to be the most appropriate methodology for this study. 
Lean unified simulation modeling leverages Supply Chain Value Stream Mapping (SCVSM) and Discrete Event 
Simulation (DES) to capture, record, evaluate, and decrease inventory waiting times, delays, queues, and other wastes 
for a specific product family. Following various lean proposals in the future state SCVSM, the findings of this 
investigation reveal a significant improvement in warehouse lead time. There was significant increase in the value-
added time and reduction in non-value added time with the assistance of risk free DES models that replicated the entire 
operations for the purpose of present and future state simulation along with suggestions for improvements. This study 
proved to possess strong managerial and practical implications that shall help in better decision-making by deeply 
understanding the supply chain activities that occur as discrete events inside a warehouse.

1. Introduction and Problem Identification
This research is focussed on pharmaceutical warehouse supply chain operations. A leading Malaysian Pharmaceutical 
firm was approached to carry out this study. According to (Aigbogun, Ghazali, & Razali, 2014) the pharmaceutical 
industry is growing at a commendable rate and it appears to face problems in the field of on-time delivery (OTD) of 
medicines. Due to very high demand, hospitals and pharmacies run out of drugs on a few occasions, or some medicines 
are left unused for expiry on the other side. A percentage of these types of problems come directly from the 
pharmaceutical warehouse, which is primarily responsible for lead time build up and therefore struggles to align easily 
with market trends (Friemann and Schönsleben 2016; Leung et al. 2016).  
The research examined a firm that was experiencing challenges like as lead time, poor customer service, and supply 
chain misalignment. The warehouse manager, production manager, and sales manager conducted interviews to better 
understand the issue. They discovered that the warehouse employed a deterministic inventory model with a push-based 
approach, with many actions being unpredictable and undefined. The research sought to give a more complete view of 
the company's difficulties. The warehouse experienced a significant lead time build-up due to random operations and 
sub-operations. The inbound supply chain was threefold: raw material, production, and packing and shipping. The 
work-in-process supply chain in the pharmaceutical production building was difficult to map due to regulations and 
constraints. The warehouse facility and manpower struggled to solve the problem, leading to unpredictable throughput

Simulation and quantification were not done to target a single lean tool, but the relative lead time reduction was 
incorporated in the model which was later validated by the warehouse expert.  
 
This integrated strategy can be directly used for effective decision making and production process planning from the 
perspective of warehouse related problems. The lean supply chain needs a strong strategy to validate its existence and 
effectiveness. The supply chain VSM is very much helpful in sorting the causes of buffers and queues in the process 
charts. The performance and efficiency of the supply chain and in this case a warehouse is seen to be changing positively. 
The scope for reduction of waste, waiting time, unwanted buffering and handling the work in process inventory was 
greatly magnified. Overall inventory related activities inside the warehouse were visualized thoroughly. Integration of 
static future state VSM and analytical DES widened up the scope for the development of the warehouse activities and 
help in better decision making on cutting down wastes in terms of lead time. This study provides useful suggestions for 
improving inventory handling and storage procedures effectively inside the pharmaceutical warehouse and also can be 
adapted to other sector warehouses. The results of this can help warehouse managers to structure their warehouse 
management contingent on the context in which the warehouse operates 
 
Since the study is conducted in one of the Malaysia’s leading government based pharmaceutical firms, this may pave the 
way for other small scale industries all over the world to learn and find insights towards lean warehousing and take better 
decision making after a detailed DES simulations. Step by step standard of operations according to the practical industrial 
procedure backed up by literature support were followed in this study to build the present and future state VSM and later 
build DES models. The proposed VSM and DES integration framework that was applied to study this warehouse can 
also be adopted by other firms to improve their warehouse. However, the successful lean implementation in the 
warehouse will face several hurdles in its course. According to the inferences gained from this study, the scope for supply 
chain VSM was abundant, especially in pharmaceutical warehouse scenarios. Some of the literature cited in this paper 
can be used to set a goal and redesign a new work-plan for an effective supply chain. The significance of the framework 
proposed by (Schmidtke et al. 2014a) was adapted in this study to understand the gaps in the current system. Effective 
decision making and optimal resource allocation can be done by modelling a set of warehouse activities using the VSM-
DES integrated approach and also with an strong material handling library. It can also be used nowadays to analyze time 
taken and reduce costs in the warehouse environment. Insights from this research can break down complex supply chain 
systems and model into minute discrete events in order to display the relationship between the activities and the time and 
performance that impacts the overall system.  
 
Moreover, complex warehouse behaviors were modelled by a flexible modelling approach to note down interactions 
between environment, population, and individuals using this software tool. The model moves forward in time at discrete 
intervals. It is used to solve a wide range of problems. Entities, attributes, queues, assets, and time form the core concept 
model in this study. Entities are the initiators or starters of a model. Attributes are feature dependence and carry 
information regarding the previous entity. Other parameters are queues (waiting time), assets (inventory), and time (time 
taken for each module and sub-module. All these were used to quantify the benefits of lean. Time-based performance 
statistics were obtained to visualize details on inventory, transportation, manpower, and equipment usage was visualized 
under a time-based graphical output which can portray a performance measure of any activity.

Abstract 
At present, debates addressing climate change, fossil fuel depletion, and energy saving highlight the need for a more 
sustainable built environment to reduce energy consumption and emission trends in the building sector. With a primary 
focus on commercial buildings in Sri Lanka, where Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems 
account for a significant portion of electricity usage, this research investigates into the underexplored area of airside 
efficiency strategies. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature synthesis was conducted, and a qualitative research 
approach using a semi-structured interview survey was conducted targeting 17 experts. The collected data was then 
analysed using content analysis. The findings of the research revealed 17 strategies under 3 categories namely, Air 
Handling Unit (AHU) optimisation, system design and layout optimisation, and cooling system optimisation. Key 
strategies identified are, the installation of efficient AHU filters, Variable Air Volume (VAV) system implementation, 
advanced controls and automation, reduction of coil losses, Variable Speed Drive (VSDs) installation, a control system 
addressing varying loads, night purging and air distribution and balancing. The knowledge gathered through this study 
can be used by respective industry professionals to enhance HVAC energy performance, while it will also help the 
academia to research more on this sub-branch of HVAC system in the Sri Lankan context.

1. Introduction
The global landscape is witnessing a surge in energy consumption, triggering concerns about resource depletion and 
environmental repercussions (Song et al. 2015). Within this context, the building sector stands out as a significant 
contributor, accounting for approximately 33% of the world's final energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions 
(Urge-Vorsatz et al. 2019). At the forefront of energy consumption in buildings is the Heating, Ventilation, and Air 
Conditioning (HVAC) system, a vital component that plays a pivotal role in providing thermal comfort and indoor air 
quality. When it comes to the Sri Lankan context, a similar situation can be seen. For example, in the context of Sri 
Lanka, the building sector has become the dominant consumer of primary energy, constituting nearly 60% of the 
nation's electricity consumption (Ministry of Power & Energy 2019). Within this sector, a substantial portion of energy 
is allocated to HVAC systems, reflecting the operational and functional characteristics of commercial buildings. 
Analysis of aggregated sub-metering data reveals that HVAC systems account for approximately 51% of electricity 
end-use breakdown in Sri Lanka (Geekiyanage & Ramachandra 2018).  
Recognising the complexity of HVAC systems, it is imperative to dissect their components for a comprehensive 
understanding (Ahmad et al. 2018). Patel et al. (2018) emphasise the division of HVAC systems into waterside 
(chillers, pumps, and cooling towers) and airside (VAV terminals, supply and return fans). Both these subsystems 
contribute synergistically to the overall energy efficiency of the HVAC system. Faulkner et al. (2023) stress the need 
to consider both waterside and airside components simultaneously to achieve optimal energy savings in buildings. 
Hence, the HVAC airside system plays a critical role in the broader context of energy efficiency. The airside system 
significantly influences indoor air quality (IAQ), occupant health, and overall productivity (Kang et al. 2021).

strategies identified from the research findings under Cooling system optimisation which involves the utilisation of 
cool outdoor air during nighttime hours to naturally ventilate and to use fresh air if its enthalpy is lower than that of 
return air.  
 
7. Conclusions  
In Sri Lanka, the building service that uses the most energy in a commercial building is HVAC. It combines elements 
of both waterside and airside systems, and at the moment, energy-efficient techniques are primarily applied to 
waterside systems because they have larger and more numerous components. Nevertheless, implementing waterside-
only energy efficiency measures will only result in approximately 60% of energy savings; the remaining 40% can be 
attained by implementing airside-only energy efficiency measures, as the combined effect of both systems will result 
in savings for the HVAC system as a whole. 
 
Even though this is already adopted in developed countries, this is an area, in which commercial buildings in Sri Lanka 
are lagging in. Thus, this research was intended to explore the strategies to enhance the energy efficiency of HVAC 
Airside systems of commercial buildings in Sri Lanka. Altogether, 17 strategies were identified from this study to 
enhance energy efficiency of HVAC Airside system. Out of it, 11 are from the literature review, and they are namely, 
installation of an efficient AHU filter, efficient AHU fan system, airside economizer, heat recovery wheel, efficient 
ducting system design, installation of VAV system, efficient AHU selection, Pre-cooled Air Conditioning System, 
Demand Control Ventilation, advanced controls and automation and optimal start-stop mechanism. Additionally, six 
strategies were discovered from the research findings, and they are, reducing coil losses, installation of VSD, 
installation of a control system to meet varying loads, air distribution and balancing, and night purge ventilation. The 
conclusion of the literature analysis and expert insights underscores several key strategies pivotal for enhancing the 
energy efficiency of HVAC Airside systems. Among these, the installation of efficient AHU filters, implementation 
of VAV systems, adoption of advanced controls and automation, reduction of coil losses, installation of VSD, 
implementation of a control system addressing varying loads, air distribution and balancing, enthalpy controlling and 
embracing night purging emerge as central pillars. These strategies, consistently highlighted across diverse literature 
and emphasised by experts, collectively form a robust foundation for advancing energy-efficient practices in the realm 
of HVAC airside optimisation. Furthermore, it can be concluded from the research findings that all identified strategies 
are applicable to the Sri Lankan context and will facilitate commercial buildings to reach energy efficiency levels, 
hence mitigating the existing energy wastages of the HVAC system.

Abstract 
This study was looking to find what the general public thought about how they would want the form of a humanoid 
robot to appear physically and that robot’s general physical capability. In much of the available research, there was 
little if any information on polling people for what they wanted a humanoid robot to appear as physically before 
development. There are dozens of humanoid robots with vastly different size, colors, levels of realistic appearance, 
and physical capability (Raju et al. 2020). There are many studies about how people feel about the physical appearance 
of humanoid robots (Kanda et al.). There are studies on how people feel about specific robots (Mutlu et al. 2006). 
There was extremely minimal information on robots being designed from general polling of people before 
development occurred. A survey was created to ask people what a group of survey takers would desire a humanoid 
robot to look like and its general physical capability. The survey contains responses from 170 people. The people 
range from 18 to over 65. The purpose of this study was to get the general idea of what people wanted a humanoid 
robot to physically appear as regardless of other demographic factors. The survey also asked about how much physical 
capability that theoretical robot would have in their interactions with people and the general knowledge of humanoid 
robotics the survey taker possessed. The final results showed some interesting and distinct trends.

1. Introduction
There is a lot of research involving robots. In the field of humanoid robotics, there is an expansive amount of research 
for many facets within the field of study. The research includes robotic speech (Lee 2021). There is research about 
robot’s ability to walk (Ames). There is research about the physical appearance of robots (Tung 2016). There was one 
type of research that had only limited information available, and had aspects of that research with extremely limited 
information. The information deficit involved what people actually wanted a humanoid robot to look like. There is 
research available for why existing robots look the way they do (Hanson, 2019). There is research on how people 
perceive currently existing humanoid robots (Phillips et al. 2017). There was a dearth of research involving the 
designing of a robot based on how people wanted a humanoid robot to look like in general. Perhaps this information 
exists in the proprietary archives of the groups and companies of those making humanoid robots, but those records

further away it got from their age category. There are charts showing percentages and average answer values by age 
range in the survey (Table 1). 
 
This table shows by percentage by age range the respondents who were aware of the humanoid robots discussed in 
this survey. While the low survey numbers within certain age ranges could have skewed the data, it was not very 
consistent between the different robots and different age ranges. The one exception to this is the youngest age range, 
they had the highest knowledge of all robots in all age ranges. This Table 2 will show the mean value by age range 
and overall, for all the 1 through 5 questions.

These numbers show that knowledge and desire of humanoid robots is not necessarily consistent. While the youngest 
age range had the highest knowledge, they had among the lowest desire for human-like appearance in the individual 
categories. The oldest age group had very inconsistent results between the categories. They ranged from the absolute 
lowest in some areas, while being near the top in others. The second oldest age range was either the highest average, 
or very close to it, in every category. There is the issue that all 3 of these age ranges had the lowest number of 
respondents and that could have affected the results. 
 
 
The results of the survey have shown some weaknesses of this survey. The low number of total respondents allowed 
for small numbers of individuals to potentially skew the data, especially once it was divided out into the separate age 
groups. The lack of demographic information may have assisted in the stated goal of getting additional participants, 
but could have hidden other factors regarding the results. Gender would have been a question that, in hindsight, could 
have illuminated additional information about the results. Gender may have played a much larger role than age, or 
maybe not. The survey did not require any registration and was not controlled. This means that 1 individual could 
have submitted multiple responses to the survey. There were precautions taken to make this more challenging, but it 
was not impossible to do so. The issue with having some kind of registration to take the survey is that it may have 
scared off potential survey takers. The largest issue remained getting more people to take the survey to mitigate small 
numbers of people from skewing results. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results of the survey proved to be very enlightening. The Uncanny Valley appears to be a distinct factor in most 
of the survey respondents' minds. There seems to be a general acceptance of robots and for the physical capability of 
those robots. Moving arms, walking, and talking all were viewed fairly favorably. Humanlike appearance and full 
human-like robots were viewed much less favorably. Knowledge of specific humanoid robots and age played a factor 
in the responses the survey takers provided, but the results are very clear. The survey takers have shown that they want 
their robots to not look too much like an actual human.
