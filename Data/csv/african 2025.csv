Abstract 
 
This study addresses the persistent issue of low equipment availability in Peruvian SMEs within the metalworking 
industry. Previous research has highlighted the need for tailored maintenance strategies to enhance operational 
efficiency in similar contexts. This investigation focused on a small company specializing in office furniture 
manufacturing, which faced recurring downtime and insufficient maintenance practices. The proposed model 
integrated Lean Manufacturing, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) 
to foster sustainable improvements. Key actions included implementing autonomous maintenance for early fault 
detection, prioritizing equipment reliability through RCM, and establishing standardized maintenance procedures. 
Quantitative results demonstrated an 11.80% increase in equipment availability and a 20.73% reduction in cycle time. 
These enhancements not only improved productivity but also contributed to employee engagement and a proactive 
maintenance culture. Future research is encouraged to explore similar models in other SMEs, addressing sector-
specific challenges and fostering industrial resilience in dynamic markets.

1. Introduction 
Exploring the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the metalworking industry is fundamental to 
understanding their impact on the global economy, especially in Latin America and Peru. This sector is crucial, as it 
represents a significant portion of industrial production and employment in many emerging economies. According to 
the International Labour Organization (ILO), SMEs are responsible for approximately 70% of employment in Latin 
America, highlighting their importance in income generation and economic stability (Vaidyanathan et al. 2012). In",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

The research also underscores the socioeconomic impact of implementing an efficient maintenance model in Peruvian 
metalworking SMEs, a sector that significantly contributes to local economy and employment. By improving 
equipment availability and reducing operational costs, these companies can not only increase profitability but also 
strengthen their competitive position in a globalized environment. Furthermore, reducing downtime and production 
defects enhances customer satisfaction, improving the companies' market reputation. In a context where sustainability 
is increasingly valued, this model offers a viable alternative that incorporates environmentally responsible practices 
through resource optimization and waste reduction, aligning with sustainable development goals. 
 
For the future, further research is suggested to explore this model's application in other industrial sectors and 
geographic contexts to validate its effectiveness and adaptability. Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate the 
impact of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), in maintenance 
management, as these can improve fault detection accuracy and further optimize resources. Finally, it is recommended 
to investigate the long-term impact of implementing this model on the organizational culture of SMEs, examining 
how the benefits of a culture of continuous improvement and employee empowerment can be sustained amid changing

Abstract 
 
The study focused on addressing critical production inefficiencies in Peruvian garment manufacturing SMEs, a sector 
vital for economic and social development yet challenged by high defect rates and resource mismanagement. Prior 
research emphasized the potential of Lean Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), yet their 
application in SMEs remained underexplored. This research proposed a structured model integrating tools like 5S, 
Kanban, and TPM across three phases: change management, methodology design, and process standardization. 
Implementation yielded notable results, including a reduction in defect rates from 11.7% to 5.1%, a 7.1% decrease in 
average production time, and a 37,214 PEN cost saving in rework. These improvements enhanced operational 
efficiency, product quality, and employee engagement. The findings demonstrate the scalability of Lean and TPM 
methodologies for SMEs, bridging gaps in existing literature. Further studies should explore advanced technologies 
and their integration into such frameworks, fostering long-term resilience and competitiveness in dynamic markets.

1. Introduction 
The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the garment manufacturing industry play a crucial role in the 
global economy, particularly in regions like Latin America and Peru. This sector is not only a driver of employment 
but also significantly contributes to the economic and social development of these nations. According to the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), SMEs represent over 90% of all businesses and generate approximately 60% 
of global employment (ILO, 2020) (Garzoni et al. 2020). In Latin America, the textile sector is among the most 
significant, with a direct impact on the economies of countries such as Peru, where garment-manufacturing SMEs 
account for a substantial portion of clothing production and exports (Lima Chamber of Commerce  2019). The ability 
of these companies to adapt to the demands of both global and local markets is essential for their sustainability and 
growth, underscoring the need to implement efficient and effective management practices (González et al. 2021). 
 
Despite their importance, garment-manufacturing SMEs face numerous production challenges that limit their 
competitiveness and efficiency. Among these are the inadequate distribution of processes, which can lead to 
bottlenecks and production delays (Cruz et al. 2020). Additionally, the lack of sewing inspection plans results in low-",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025

The contributions of this research are significant for the field of industrial engineering and operations management, 
particularly in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises. It bridges a notable gap in the literature by providing 
a detailed, scalable model tailored for the garment manufacturing sector, where existing studies often focus on larger 
enterprises or other industries. The proposed approach demonstrates that implementing Lean and TPM principles in 
SMEs can effectively address critical operational challenges, providing empirical evidence to support future 
applications. Moreover, this study offers a framework that integrates technical, organizational, and cultural aspects, 
ensuring a holistic transformation process that aligns with the realities of resource-constrained environments. 
 
Final observations suggest that the methodology developed in this study can serve as a reference for similar industries 
facing comparable challenges. However, further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of these 
interventions, particularly in terms of sustained employee engagement and adaptability to market changes. 
Additionally, future studies could expand the application of this model to other sectors, validating its scalability and 
identifying potential modifications to enhance its effectiveness. The integration of advanced technologies, such as IoT 
and predictive analytics, within the Lean and TPM frameworks may also offer new opportunities for improving 
decision-making and operational resilience. These considerations provide a pathway for continued exploration and 
development, ensuring the relevance and applicability of this research in evolving industrial contexts.

Abstract 
 
The operational inefficiencies of retail distribution centers, such as prolonged order preparation times, incomplete 
shipments, and increased costs, have a profound impact on supply chain performance and customer satisfaction. 
Previous studies have primarily focused on general logistics challenges, leaving a research gap in addressing these 
issues through Methods Engineering. This study aimed to optimize productivity and reduce operational costs in order 
preparation and dispatch processes by implementing a structured model comprising six interconnected phases. Key 
improvements included process standardization, ergonomic interventions, and data-driven workflow optimization. 
The results demonstrated a 40.85% increase in productivity, a reduction in headcount by 28%, and a 35.29% decrease 
in logistics costs, alongside a rise in on-time deliveries from 92% to 96.1%. These findings contribute to the academic 
field by providing a replicable and scalable framework, fostering both operational efficiency and worker safety. Future 
research should explore advanced technologies like automation to further enhance the model’s adaptability.

workflow optimization, and continuous improvement strategies, bridging gaps in the existing literature regarding 
operational inefficiencies in retail logistics. This model is particularly relevant for organizations seeking to enhance 
their adaptability and competitiveness in dynamic market conditions. Moreover, the emphasis on quantitative metrics 
allows for precise monitoring and evaluation of improvements, ensuring that interventions are both effective and 
scalable. 
Final observations highlight the necessity of adopting comprehensive strategies that combine human-centric 
approaches with technological advancements to optimize operational processes. While the proposed model 
demonstrates substantial improvements, future research could explore the integration of advanced technologies such 
as automation and IoT to further enhance efficiency. Additionally, studies could focus on the long-term impacts of 
ergonomic interventions on worker health and productivity. Expanding the application of this model to other industries 
and operational contexts could provide valuable insights, fostering the development of adaptable and resilient logistics 
systems.

operational performance. By integrating the 5S methodology and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), the study 
proposed a structured model to optimize workflow and enhance punctuality.Key outcomes included a 33.62% 
reduction in material transport distances and a 27.27% decrease in service line delays, leading to a compliance rate 
improvement from 89.6% to 100%. The elimination of diner incidents underscored the model's effectiveness in 
improving safety and quality. These findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating the scalability of Lean tools 
in service sectors, offering actionable frameworks for operational excellence. Future research could explore advanced 
technologies to sustain these gains.

Abstract 
 
The study addressed critical inefficiencies in heavy goods transport SMEs, focusing on improving service levels and 
operational reliability. It identified challenges such as low On-Time In Full (OTIF) rates and high equipment failure 
rates, which significantly impacted service quality. The proposed research integrated Total Productive Maintenance 
(TPM) principles and Process Management into a unified maintenance model, emphasizing planned and autonomous 
maintenance strategies. Key findings revealed measurable improvements: OTIF increased by 7.24%, fuel shortages 
dropped by 50%, and damaged load indices decreased by 23.20%. These outcomes underscored the model’s potential 
to enhance resource utilization and service reliability. This research demonstrated the relevance of systematic 
maintenance strategies in aligning operational activities with organizational goals, fostering efficiency and 
sustainability. By addressing specific gaps in existing maintenance practices, the study provided a replicable 
framework applicable across similar contexts, offering actionable insights for enhancing operational metrics in 
resource-constrained environments. It significantly contributed to bridging knowledge gaps in maintenance 
management for SMEs, particularly in the transport sector. Future investigations should explore integrating advanced 
digital tools, such as IoT-based monitoring systems, to expand predictive maintenance capabilities. Moreover, cross-
sectoral comparative analyses could enrich understanding of the model’s adaptability and limitations. This research 
sets the groundwork for ongoing advancements in SME maintenance management.

implementation of a maintenance management model integrating Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Process 
Management addressed these inefficiencies effectively. Key findings showed a 7.24% improvement in the OTIF 
indicator, alongside a 50% reduction in fuel shortages and a 23.20% decrease in damaged load index. The planned 
and autonomous maintenance strategies contributed significantly to these outcomes, highlighting their potential to 
enhance operational performance. By focusing on systematic maintenance scheduling and empowering drivers 
through autonomous maintenance, the model demonstrated the feasibility of achieving cost-effective, sustainable 
improvements in equipment reliability and service delivery. 
 
This research underscores the importance of integrating structured maintenance methodologies with operational 
strategies in SMEs. The study’s emphasis on aligning maintenance activities with organizational objectives reflects 
its contribution to operational sustainability and service quality in the heavy goods transport sector. By addressing 
gaps in existing maintenance practices, the proposed model not only improved the operational metrics of the case 
study but also provided a replicable framework applicable to similar contexts. The results validate the strategic value 
of TPM and Process Management as complementary approaches for enhancing resource utilization and reliability. 
The contributions to the field are manifold. First, the study bridges a significant research gap by extending TPM 
methodologies to SMEs in the transport sector, a domain often overlooked in the literature. Second, it offers a practical 
application of process management in maintenance, demonstrating its role in reducing inefficiencies and aligning 
operational goals. Third, the findings provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to implement maintenance 
strategies in resource-constrained environments, thereby promoting broader adoption of these methodologies in 
similar industrial settings. 
 
Observations indicate that while the proposed model achieved measurable improvements, the long-term success of 
such interventions depends on continuous training, adherence to maintenance schedules, and regular performance 
evaluations. Future studies could explore integrating digital tools, such as IoT-based monitoring systems, to further 
enhance the predictive maintenance capabilities and scalability of the model. Additionally, comparative analyses 
involving multiple SMEs across different industrial sectors could provide a broader understanding of the model’s 
adaptability and limitations. Such investigations would enrich the academic discourse on maintenance management 
while offering practical solutions for industry stakeholders. The findings and framework presented herein establish a 
foundation for ongoing research and practical advancements in maintenance management for SMEs, fostering a 
culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence.

Abstract 
 
This study investigates the axial crushing behaviour of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymeric (CFRP) tubes, both hollow 
and filled with polyurethane (PU) foam infused with varying amounts and sizes of milled glass fibres. The micro-
glass fibres were added to the foam during the manufacturing process to enhance its shear properties. Different weight 
percentage and sizes of the microfibers were studied. After full curing, composite tubes were subjected to axial 
crushing tests. Properties like load-bearing capacity, energy absorption, crushing efficiency, and specific energy 
absorption were studied. The results showed that finer 1/32-inch fibres significantly enhance load bearing and energy 
absorption in foam-filled tubes, with the 1-32 5% configuration demonstrating the highest performance. On the other 
hand, the non-filled CFRP tube exhibited the highest specific energy, indicating superior energy absorption efficiency 
relative to its weight.

1.Introduction  
Composite materials, mainly carbon composites (CFRP), are widely used in engineering because of their advanced 
mechanical properties. They are associated with high performance, such as high strength, stiffness, and energy 
absorption capabilities. These characteristics of corban fiber composites are ideal for aerospace, marine, and many 
more engineering industries applications. One of the main advantages is carbon fiber composite's weight reduction, 
and their crashworthiness is critical (Khan et al. (2023)). Conventional engineering materials, such as metallic 
elements, are progressively being replaced by carbon composites due to their advanced advantages in physical, 
mechanical, deliquescence, and thermal properties (Sebaey and Mahdi (2017)). Including high-performance 
advantages, which are tensile, compressive, and low density, all outstanding fatigue properties are important structural 
performance adoptions. One of the main advantages the carbon composites is that they are very lightweight due to 
this characteristic of its impact on fuel efficiency (Junaedi et al. (2023)).  
 
The researcher recently became inadequate and focused on improving the crashworthiness of composite structures 
with some modifications to the composites for reinforcement technique. Recently, many techniques for modifications","Proceedings of the 6th AfricanInternational Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

the same magnification) 
 
 
Adding the milled glass microfibers into PU foam within carbon composite tubes improved the axial characteristics. The 
microfibers are 1/32-inch in size at 5% weight, demonstrating the most favorable axial load capacity and energy absorption 
performance and providing potential engineering applications in crash structures, such as automotive safety. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, CFRP tubes with and without foam filler were subjected to axial crushing tests, and the results were 
analyzed. The effect of infusing foam filler with different sizes and weight percentages of milled glass fiber was also 
examined. The experimental analysis revealed changes in properties such as load bearing, energy absorption, and 
crushing efficiency of the composite tubes studied. The study showed that introducing milled glass fibers into PU 
foam within CFRP tubes significantly influences the crushing characteristics of the composite. Notably, the composite 
with 1/32 5% fibers achieved a peak strength of 12 kN, significantly higher than the NF tube's performance of 8.4 kN, 
with the composite with 0% fibers exhibiting a strength of 11.3 kN. This indicates that the 1/32 fiber size contributes 
to better load distribution and overall strength, emphasizing the importance of optimizing fiber dimensions for 
improved structure. 
 
It was found that larger fibers (1/16 5% and 1/16 20%) exhibit lower energy absorption (~0.45 kJ) and specific energy 
(~20 J/g) due to fiber agglomeration, which hinders load transfer and weakens the composite. Achieving a balance 
between total energy absorption and specific energy is crucial, as improper fiber size and dispersion can lead to 
inefficient load transfer. Proper optimization of these factors is essential to enhance the mechanical performance and 
structural integrity of fiber-reinforced composites. The analysis of crushing force efficiency shows that the 20% 
sample with smaller 1/32-inch fibers at higher concentrations (1/32) achieves the highest efficiency, around 80%, in 
converting applied force into energy absorption. In contrast, the NF sample demonstrates the lowest efficiency. Future 
work could further optimize fiber parameters to improve crashworthiness in automotive and aerospace applications.

Abstract  
  
This paper develops a demand forecasting model based on SARIMA and inventory management methodologies such 
as 5S, FIFO and ABC Classification in a food, beverage and cleaning products marketing company. The integration 
of these tools allowed to improve the accuracy of the forecasts, optimize inventory turnover and reduce the 
obsolescence rate, contributing significantly to the increase in sales conversion and customer satisfaction. By using 
the SARIMA model, replenishment decisions were adjusted to seasonal patterns, while 5S and FIFO methodologies 
improved warehouse organization and inventory traceability. The results of the project show a positive impact on key 
indicators such as MAPE, RMSE and MAE, as well as on the customer conversion rate, achieving an increase from 
78% to 95%. In addition, training processes and audits were implemented to ensure the sustainability of improvements 
in the long term. This approach demonstrates how the integration of mathematical models and lean manufacturing 
practices can transform operational efficiency in the retail sector.

1. Introduction  
Effective inventory management is a critical determinant of success in the retail industry, particularly in sectors dealing 
with perishable goods such as food, beverages, and cleaning products. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
frequently encounter challenges related to demand forecasting accuracy, inventory obsolescence, and inefficient 
storage organization, which lead to stock shortages, financial losses, and suboptimal sales conversion rates. These 
inefficiencies hinder business performance by reducing product availability and increasing waste, ultimately 
impacting profitability. 
 
This study proposes an integrated approach that combines time-series demand forecasting using the SARIMA model 
with inventory management techniques such as 5S, FIFO, and ABC classification to optimize inventory control and 
enhance sales performance. The research is based on a case study of a small retail company currently experiencing a 
customer conversion rate of 78%, where 68% of lost sales are due to product unavailability and 17% result from 
expired stock. By implementing a data-driven demand forecasting model and a structured inventory management 
system, this research aims to increase the conversion rate to 95%, improve inventory turnover, and reduce 
obsolescence. 
 
Furthermore, the study assesses the economic impact of inefficient inventory control, demonstrating how predictive 
analytics and systematic warehouse organization can mitigate financial losses. Emphasis is also placed on the role of 
workforce training in sustaining these improvements over time.",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on retail inventory optimization by providing empirical evidence 
of SARIMA’s practical applications in improving demand forecasts. Unlike traditional inventory models that rely on 
historical trends alone, this study emphasizes the importance of continuous model refinement and real-time 
adjustments to enhance accuracy and efficiency. 
Future research could explore the integration of AI-driven forecasting models alongside SARIMA to further enhance 
predictive capabilities. Additionally, expanding this methodology to other retail sectors could validate its scalability 
and broader applicability. 
 
Although this study focused on a small retail business dealing with perishable goods, the proposed methodology is 
potentially adaptable to other sectors, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and fast-moving consumer goods. 
Adjustments to the frequency of demand updates, classification criteria, and shelf-life controls would be necessary to 
tailor the model to specific industry contexts. This suggests the framework has broader applicability, particularly in 
environments where accurate demand forecasting and inventory control are essential for operational 
efficiency.Overall, this study reinforces the value of data-driven decision-making in inventory management, 
demonstrating that statistical forecasting, when properly integrated with operational strategies, leads to measurable 
efficiency gains and financial benefits in retail environments.

Abstract 
 
Agricultural cooperatives play a crucial role in rural development and sustainable agriculture. This study examines 
the role of mediating governance in the application of cooperative principles among agricultural cooperatives. The 
research draws on evidence from multiple studies across different regions to provide a comprehensive analysis. 
Governance structures in agricultural cooperatives have undergone significant changes in recent decades, adapting to 
evolving market environments and member needs. These changes have implications for member control, manager 
accountability, and overall cooperative performance. The study explores how governance mechanisms mediate the 
application of cooperative principles, such as democratic member control, member economic participation, and 
concern for community. The research reveals that cooperatives have developed innovative governance models to 
balance traditional principles with market demands. For instance, some cooperatives have adopted multi-stakeholder 
approaches, integrating producers, consumers, and other stakeholders to create more sustainable food systems. This 
approach challenges the conventional divide between producers and consumer cooperatives, potentially enhancing the 
application of cooperative principles. The study reveals that effective governance plays a critical role in mediating the 
application of cooperative principles in agricultural cooperatives. It enables cooperatives to maintain their core values 
while adapting to changing market conditions and member expectations.",,,african 2025

Abstract 
 
This research investigates faculty mentorship as a pivotal factor influencing educational quality in private universities 
in Oman, highlighting the tension between academic rigor and financial imperatives. The study underscores the need 
to address how mentoring practices are increasingly shaped by profit-driven pressures, a topic largely overlooked in 
the Quality Education framework. Using in-depth interviews, observations, and secondary data analysis, the research 
examines the extent to which financial constraints and mentorship practices affect academic standards and student 
outcomes. The findings reveal that mentorship programs, originally intended to support faculty development, have 
been repurposed to align with revenue generation goals. This shift prioritizes financial objectives, such as student 
retention and satisfaction, over academic integrity. Informal mentoring further exacerbates the issue, reinforcing 
profit-focused policies and fostering practices like lenient grading and reduced rigor. These trends contribute to grade 
inflation, diminished academic standards, and devalued degrees, which undermine student success and institutional 
credibility. Additionally, the profit-oriented approach displaces academic priorities, leading to ethical conflicts, job 
dissatisfaction, and reduced faculty morale. The study calls for a critical reassessment of mentorship roles in private 
universities, advocating for transparent and accountable policies that balance financial sustainability with academic 
excellence. By preserving the integrity of higher education, such reforms can enhance faculty development, support 
student success, and uphold the fundamental values of academia.

Introduction  
The United Nations has designated this decade as a critical period for advancing quality education. Education is 
recognized as a fundamental right for all individuals, irrespective of their social backgrounds or demographic 
characteristics, including gender, race, and geographical location. It is imperative to provide equitable opportunities 
for everyone, particularly marginalized groups, without compromising educational quality. Faculty mentorship is 
expected to play a pivotal role in upholding and enhancing these educational standards. However, the rapid growth of 
universities, along with increasing student enrollment and faculty numbers, presents significant challenges for 
managing academic programs, especially in the profit-driven private university sector (Qureshi & Khawaja 2021). 
This surge in educational institutions has led to various issues, particularly with a diverse student population from 
urban areas, rural communities, and Bedouin backgrounds (Awashreh & Al Ghunaimi 2025). Unfortunately, many 
private universities seem to prioritize financial gains over their commitment to academic integrity and quality 
(Awashreh 2025 a) . 
 
In Oman, approximately 50% of higher education students are enrolled in 27 private institutions (Awashreh 2024). 
Most, if not all, of these students receive government funding, especially those in undergraduate programs. This 
highlights the necessity of faculty mentorship, which directly impacts the quality of higher education and the skill 
outcomes of graduates. A concerning trend has emerged where these institutions shift their focus from genuine 
academic development to financial sustainability. The profit motive can erode academic standards, leading institutions",,,african 2025

Abstract 
 
This paper aims to identify and classify the barriers of implementing circular economy principles in the context of 
maintenance 5.0. This study employed an approach that involved developing a structural relationship model based on 
interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to analyze and prioritize the drivers impacting the implementation of circular 
economy principles. Results confirmed that the barriers identified including technical and knowledge barriers, 
financial constraints, and infrastructure limitations, are recognized as the most significant challenges. The results of 
this study make it easier for decision-makers to identify and overcome these barriers. Additionally, the limitations of 
this study have been outlined, presenting opportunities for further research in this area. Finally, we discuss future 
research directions as well as the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings.

Improving Radiology Workflow Efficiency: Insights from 
Simulation-Based Operational Modeling

Abstract 
 
Healthcare systems are challenged globally to provide high quality care while managing limited resources and budgets. 
Radiology departments provide critical diagnostic services to nearly every medical discipline. Delays in imaging 
services can unnecessarily extend patient hospital stays and lead to overcrowding in inpatient departments. Therefore, 
any inefficiencies in radiology can have a cascading effects on the operations of other departments and the hospital 
performance as a whole. Despite the importance of improving workflow efficiency in radiology departments, little 
attention has been paid to detailed case studies that investigate its specific challenges. This study addresses this gap 
by applying a simulation-based analysis to a radiology department in a major hospital in Saudi Arabia. A validated 
discrete event simulation model was developed through a comprehensive analysis of historical records and close 
collaboration with stakeholders. The findings highlight the transformative potential of simulation in providing 
actionable insights for healthcare managers and enhancing the department performance. The results of Scenario 2 
(Demand-Based Scheduling) outperformed those of Scenario 1 (Adjusted Staffing), achieving a 60% improvement in 
resource utilization and 40% cost savings relative to the baseline model. However, implementing demand-based 
scheduling introduces greater scheduling complexity and may lead to increased staff resistance. A phased transition 
strategy is suggested to maximize long-term benefits while minimizing disruptions to operations. Future research 
should focus on empirical validation through assessing the implementation in real-world hospital setting to strengthen 
the applicability of the findings.

1. Introduction 
Healthcare systems are challenged globally to provide high-quality care while managing limited resources and 
budgets. The complexity of healthcare delivery derived from growing populations, restricted recruitment pools and 
technological advancements has amplified the need for optimizing operations. In order to utilize resources efficiently, 
hospitals need to streamline workflows to sustain serving growing patient volumes while maintaining accessibility of 
healthcare services. Radiology departments provide critical diagnostic services that enable treatment planning. Nearly 
every department in the hospital relies on accurate and timely imaging services to guide patient care. Delays in imaging 
services can unnecessarily extend patient hospital stays and lead to overcrowding in inpatient departments. Therefore, 
any inefficiencies in radiology can have a cascading effect on the operations of other departments and the hospital 
performance as a whole. 
 
To sustain high levels of efficiency, radiology departments must balance resource allocations with patient arrival 
volumes. However, prolonged patient waiting times, high or low levels of resource utilization and workforce 
scheduling issues can  arise due to inflexible staffing structure and shifts that fail to accommodate the dynamic nature 
of patient demand.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

within a sonographer’s shift further enhance the flexibility of this shift schedule. However, it is more complex to 
implement since it requires accurate demand forecasting and frequent shift changes.  
 
The changes proposed by both scenarios inherently carry the risk of resistance to change. The anticipated increase in 
workload further amplifies this risk. This could result in reducing morale and increasing turnover. The flexible 
scheduling in Scenario 2 may particularly impose an additional burden on staff. Frequent shift changes and having 
two-hour gaps in the schedule may not be well received by staff. Therefore, a change management program is essential 
to support the successful implementation of the new scheduling approach. 
 
It is possible to combine both scenarios in a hybrid strategy to maximize long-term benefits while minimizing 
disruptions to operations. Scenario 1 (Adjusted Staffing) can be implemented first by reducing staff gradually while 
monitoring patient waiting times and tracking sonographers workloads. This ensures that service levels continue to be 
within the target range while quantifying the impact on sonographers. A gradual transition to Scenario 2 is 
recommended following a thorough evaluation of its operational impact and staff adaptability. This can include 
developing and refining forecasting tools, introducing some shift variations gradually and conducting pilot tests. 
 
In summary, these results show that both scenarios significantly enhance sonographer utilization and cost saving 
compared to the baseline. Scenario 1 (Adjusted Staffing) is simpler to implement and leads to minimal increase in 
patient waiting time. On the other hand, Scenario 2 (Demand-Based Scheduling) performs considerably better than 
Scenario 1 in terms of sonographer utilization and cost saving. However, it introduces scheduling complexity and 
more change resistance. These finding highlight the need for a balanced approach to implementation. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The radiology function serves as a cornerstone of healthcare services, enabling essential diagnosis that underpin 
patient care. In this study, the operations of radiology were simulated to assess and enhance patient workflow. A 
tailored simulation model was developed to address the department’s needs while focusing on its core function. The 
analysis of historical data combined with stakeholders input enabled the development of a realistic and valid model. 
This simulation model allows for evaluating the current workflow to identify key bottlenecks, formulate intervention 
strategies and test potential scenarios that minimize patient waiting times and improve productivity. 
 
The analysis of the baseline revealed that resources were underutilized with opportunities to enhance the productivity 
while adhering to waiting times targets. The proposed interventions include: Scenario 1 (Adjusted Staffing) and 
Scenario 2 (Demand-Based Scheduling). These experiments confirmed that both scenarios improve sonographer 
utilization compared to the baseline model while average patient waiting times remain within the target level. 
 
The results of Scenario 2 outperformed those of Scenario 1, achieving a 60% improvement in resource utilization and 
40% cost savings relative to the baseline model. However, implementing demand-based scheduling introduces greater 
scheduling complexity and may lead to increased staff resistance. Scenario 1 is easier to implement as it involves a 
relatively smaller reduction in the number of sonographers while maintaining the existing shift structure. A phased 
transition strategy is suggested to maximize long-term benefits while minimizing disruptions to operations. The 
proposed strategy begins with implementation of Scenario 1 while elements of Scenario 2 are incorporated gradually. 
 
While this study provides valuable insights, some limitations should be acknowledged. The analysis relies on historical 
data assuming stable patient inflow rate, which may not account for sudden unexpected fluctuations such as 
emergencies with high number of cases. In addition, the model assumes changes to the baseline are applied without 
significant change resistance, which may not hold true in practice.  
 
A further study could integrate workforce considerations by investigating the relationship between shift structure and 
length on staff well-being and performance. In addition, future research should focus on empirical validation through 
assessing the implementation in real-world hospital setting to strengthen the applicability of the findings.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract  
 
The importance of textiles to humanity cannot be understated. They are used for clothing, domestic furnishings and 
industrial applications. Selection and choice of textiles and clothing follows fashion trends. Unfashionable textiles are 
discontinued from production lines, discarded in landfills, burnt, or sold as second-hand items often to poorer 
communities. Textile industry in less industrialized countries especially in Africa is facing steep decline and, in some 
cases, the entire sector has collapsed leaving the population relying on preowned products. Developed countries often 
sell preowned textile products to less developed nations. The uncontrolled influx of these products is causing 
deindustrialization due to local firms failing to compete and loss market share, unemployment, and environmental 
pollution as excess stock and degraded textiles end of in landfills and illegal dumpsites outside cities. Local industry 
needs to adopt new manufacturing technologies and strategies to revive and survive considering these challenges. This 
paper takes a life cycle approach to investigating the problem of declining textile industry in African countries and 
the impact of imported preowned textiles and how local industry can improve their manufacturing capability and 
responsiveness. This is exploratory research from literature sources. A life cycle logistics of textile products, and their 
economic and environmental impact in developing countries are studied from literature sources. A framework for 
responsible production, use, recycling, and reuse methods are identified. Ways of improving resilience of textile 
industries in developing nations together with the required technology are also prescribed.

1. Introduction  
In recent years research on second-hand economies in diverse disciplines, especially anthropology, history, geography, 
and sociology (Hansen & Le Zotte 2019). An example is the second hand clothing market which is having a profound 
effect in developing countries. The textile and clothing market share of less industrialised countries in Africa is rapidly 
declining and facing collapse as traders resort to imported preowned clothing (EEA 2019). Preowned clothing 
imported into developing countries are often too used or of  poor quality, which reduces the financial benefit of trading 
in them (Ralls, 2024). The weight of global textile waste produced each year is 92 million tonnes and is projected to 
double by 2030 (Ralls  2024). In the beginning of the last century, clothing and textiles were from natural, high-quality 
materials, easily biodegradable while today they are made of thin polyester blends (eWASA Team n.d.).  In 2021 a 
WEF report revealed that fashion was the third-most polluting industry after agriculture and construction (eWASA 
Team, n.d.). Due to competitiveness challenges in the textile sector Africa imports  most of its branded clothing and 
textile, as well as footwear and leather. For example, South Africa although being the most industrialised on the 
continent is a net importer of textiles and related  products of which R60.2 billion’s worth were imported in 2022 
(Green Cape 2023). Africa is in a strong growth phase with a young population of 1.3 billion people which is set to",,,african 2025

1. Introduction  
The foundry industry is important in growth of any industrialising nation contributing parts and components  of 
aerospace and defence, oil & gas, mechanical engineering, and automotive industries (Grand View Research 2024; 
Ramaprasad & Srinivasan 2012). Foundries are diverse processing materials such as cast iron, ductile iron, steel, 
copper alloys, aluminium, magnesium, and zinc alloys (Twarog 1993; Tiedje, et al. 2010; Merta et al. 2021; 
Ramaprasad & Srinivasan 2012). It supports downstream industry and provides employment (50th Census of World 
Casting Production  2016). A study in South Africa, 170 operating foundries employed about 9,500 people by 2015 
with an output of 430,000 metric tons (South African Institute of Foundrymen  2017; Davies  2015). It is reported that 
in 2023, the global die casting market size was estimated at USD 77.99 billion, growing to USD 82.86 billion in 2024, 
and projected to reach USD 112.14 billion by 2029 with an annual growth forecast to grow at 6.24% per year annually 
(Mordor Intelligence 2024). The global investment casting market which dominates aerospace & defence components 
was valued at USD 16.55 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow by 5.0% from 2023 to 2030 (Grand View Research, 
2024). Major foundry producers are in  North America, Europe ,Asia and South America (Grand View Research, 
2024).  
A study of the foundry industry in South Africa showed that there are 114 (66%) in Gauteng, 27 in KwaZulu-Natal, 
14 in Cape Town, and eight in the Eastern Cape. The majority in Gauteng contribute 34.7% of the gross domestic 
product (GDP) in South Africa (Iloh  et al. 2019). However, small, and medium-sized foundry sector has seen a total 
of 25 foundries closing since 2010, shedding 1,600 jobs (South African Institute of Foundrymen 2017). Foundries lack 
manufacturing economies of scale, with outdated infrastructure for capital equipment parts and lack capital investment 
to achieve capacity utilisation (South African Institute of Foundrymen  2017). Raw material made up 40% of the cost 
of an aluminium casting scrap was a key cost driver in producing castings (Fubbs  2015).The output in 2013 of 375 
240 tons was down from 660 400 tons in 2007, or 43% lower (Fubbsn2015). Sustainability is important in the foundry 
industry (Beyerstedt 2021; Foundry-Planet 2022 ). In addition to sourcing affordable raw materials and energy,",,,african 2025

Abstract  
 
Stochastic gradients are used in the training and optimization of many algorithms and techniques used in modern 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), e.g., playing a central role in stochastic gradient descent used 
for training deep neural networks. Prior to such AI/ML applications, these techniques have been around for over half 
a century, arising in diverse areas of industrial engineering (IE) and operations research (OR) areas such as queueing 
networks, production/inventory and preventive maintenance systems, and quality control, as well as in financial 
applications.  This talk will review the history of stochastic gradients, as well as survey the various approaches, both 
in the IE/OR and AI/ML contexts. More recent research has focused on discontinuous sample performance measures, 
for which conditional Monte Carlo and the generalized likelihood ratio method are two of the most successful 
approaches. IE/OR applications that require these approaches include problems that can be modeled as Markov 
decision processes (MDPs), for which it is often the case that optimal policies often take the form of a threshold policy. 
One healthcare example that will be presented has to do with optimal acceptance of a donated organ, e.g., a kidney 
patient with end-stage renal disease in need of a transplantation, which is modeled as an optimal stopping MDP. 
Another example that will be presented is estimating higher-order derivatives for queueing systems, focusing on the 
well-known single-server queue to serve as illustrative example.

Abstract  
 
In an evolutionary and increasingly demanding work environment, health professionals are challenged to demonstrate 
operational efficiency by mastering a set of skills. Technical or specialized skills alone are far from being sufficient 
to guarantee a response to the expectations of actual hospital systems and the level of service quality 
desired.Paramedical programs in higher education shape a training path that addresses several challenges to face 
current and future professional issues. Collaborative skills, teamwork, communication and autonomy remain key 
transversal skills to be developed among students. In the digital and artificial intelligence field, developing appropriate 
computer skills is also essential. Among the diversity of teaching approaches, the major challenge is to go beyond the 
limits of the classical framework towards a more engaging, motivating and promising learning environment. 
 
Computer science education remains an important training pillar enabling students to deploy the IT tools to manage 
or solve technical situations, as well as to collaborate and communicate inter- and intra-paramedical team. The 
participatory management project-based approach and storyboarding in computer science education is a mixed 
approach that encourages autonomy in learning and stimulates student engagement and motivation, not only in 
computer science, but also to enhance this tool’s effective use in the field of health care and paramedical services. 
Thus, several transversal skills are activated while learning to collaborate by jointly carrying out projects, presenting 
them and discussing them in a collective way. In this paper, a literature review was first established to identify the 
main competencies and approaches for informatics teaching. On the other hand, an observational study has been 
conducted on a sample of 90 students from two different options to conclude the value added of the proposed approach 
in terms of competency development.

1. Introduction  
Both supply chain management (SCM) and environment management literature serve as the foundation for GSCM. 
The influence and connections between SCM and the environment must be addressed in order to incorporate the 
""green"" element into SCM. The investigator's objective determines the boundary of GSCM, just like it does for SCM 
(Srivastava 2007). Under the reactive strategy, businesses start labeling recyclable products, devote less resources to 
environmental management, and employ ""end of pipeline"" activities to reduce the production's environmental impact. 
By recognizing a little resource commitment to start product recycling and creating environmentally friendly 
products, they begin to anticipate new environmental rules with a proactive strategy. Under the value-seeking 
approach, businesses incorporate strategic environmental measures like ISO adoption and green purchasing into their 
overall business plan (Srivastava 2007).  
 
According to Hajikhani et al. (2012) Numerous GSCM research have shown a wide range of factors that influence 
businesses to implement environmental management strategies and practices throughout their supply chains. It may 
be driven by the demands of the company's stakeholders, convinced by the desire of the company to fully comply 
with environmental legislation, or even encouraged by the company's internal strategic motives, which are connected 
to the chance to obtain a competitive edge in the market. Reviewing prior research indicates that the following 
categories apply to the determining factors of GSCM adoption: (1) External factors, primarily associated with 
environmental regulations and stakeholder pressures; these factors are referred to as relational motives because they","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

6. Conclusion 
The study aims to reveal the relationship between managing green supply chains and giving it a 
competitive advantage to the Arab Potash Company, to sum up, this study's findings emphasize how 
important it is for businesses to incorporate green supply chain methods. By using these strategies, 
businesses can meet consumers' increasing demands for sustainability while simultaneously improving 
their competitiveness. Investing in eco-friendly technologies and procedures can pay off in the long run 
by lowering expenses and improving branding. Therefore, it is evident that switching to sustainable supply 
chains is crucial for businesses to survive over the long run in a market where consumers are becoming 
more conscious of their environmental impact. It is also good for the environment.  
The findings reinforce the significance of green supply chains in achieving competitive advantage. 
However, the research highlights that additional factors, such as regulatory support and industry trends, 
should be considered. Practical implications for industry stakeholders include strategic investment in 
green technologies and stronger supplier collaborations.To strengthen the study’s impact, future research 
should incorporate larger sample sizes and longitudinal analyses to capture evolving trends in sustainable 
supply chain management. 
The following were the most notable outcomes:  
Fostering enduring collaboration and cooperative working partnerships.  
Compared to its rivals, growing the company is consumer base for its products.  
Collaborating and exchanging the future vision between the supplier and the company.  
Total costs drop faster than those of competitors.  
 
7. Recommendations 
Based on the previous results the researchers reached the following: 
1. Strengthen green procurement management by adopting supplier sustainability assessments. 
2. Enhance investment recovery strategies through efficient waste management. 
3. Improve statistical analysis by incorporating additional variables that influence competitive advantage. 
4. Develop clearer guidelines for integrating sustainability into purchasing policies.

Abstract 
 
The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in the last decade has transformed numerous sectors, including healthcare, 
manufacturing, finance, and logistics. As a foundational discipline supporting these industries, project management 
has a significant potential to benefit from this technological evolution. In particular, deep learning, a subset of artificial 
intelligence, is transforming project management by equipping its practitioners with advanced analytical tools that 
enable data-driven decision-making, leading to improved efficiency, adaptability, and success. This study explores 
the state of art of deep learning applications in project management, with a focus on the benefits and challenges, to 
identify knowledge gaps in utilizing these techniques to enhance project outcomes. Our findings highlight two primary 
knowledge gaps: first, the lack of empirical research exploring how deep learning integration is reshaping project 
managers' responsibilities, despite its growing adoption; and second, the limited application of artificial intelligence 
across all project phases, especially initiation and closure. While deep learning has the potential to improve overall 
project performance, challenges such as data integrity, ethical considerations, and model transparency remain 
unaddressed. Overcoming these obstacles requires closer collaboration between researchers and project managers to 
develop practical, specific solutions. In this context, this study emphasizes the need for further research to explore the 
full impact of deep learning techniques on project management and to bridge the identified gaps.

1. Introduction 
In a world of relentless change, project management must evolve dynamically to tackle emerging economic, social, 
and technological challenges with precision and foresight. In this respect, artificial intelligence has emerged as a 
transformative force, with deep learning, showing remarkable potential for revolutionizing project management 
practices. Despite its promise, the incorporation of deep learning into project management remains a largely 
unexplored domain, with knowledge gaps obstructing its broader implementation. Additionally, challenges such as 
ethical considerations, may evoke apprehension among project managers, potentially leading to resistance against 
adopting these technologies. By analyzing these aspects, this study seeks to advance the understanding of how deep 
learning can be effectively utilized to improve the outcomes throughout the project lifecycle. 
 
1.1 Objectives

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this research has successfully achieved its objectives by conducting a comprehensive literature review 
on artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and project management, with a particular emphasis on 
deep learning applications throughout the project lifecycle. The study provides a balanced analysis of the benefits, 
such as enhanced predictive capabilities, and challenges, including ethical considerations, associated with integrating 
deep learning into project management. This systematic approach has effectively identified trends and opportunities, 
demonstrating the framework's value in understanding deep learning's role in project management. 
 
Furthermore, the research has pinpointed knowledge gaps at the intersection of deep learning and project management. 
While the technical advantages of deep learning are evident, it is crucial to recognize the enduring importance of the 
human element. Deep learning models should be designed to complement leadership, team dynamics, and ethical 
considerations within project management. The future of the field will be characterized by a synergy between 
advanced artificial intelligence technologies and the invaluable expertise of project managers and their teams, ensuring 
that technological advancements are leveraged to drive project success. 
 
Two primary knowledge gaps have been identified, offering exciting opportunities for future research. Firstly, there 
is a pressing need to explore how deep learning can be more effectively applied across the entire project lifecycle, 
from initiation to closure. Secondly, understanding the human factors in the adoption of deep learning technologies 
within project management is essential. This includes examining how project managers interact with these 
technologies, the skills required for effective utilization, and the ethical and accountability issues involved. 
  
The unique contribution of this research lies in its systematic approach to categorizing deep learning applications by 
project lifecycle stages, providing a balanced analysis of benefits and challenges, and uncovering underexplored areas.  
This early-phase study shares preliminary insights and observations, as well as future research directions. The next 
step is to delve deeper into the scientific foundations of deep learning, focusing on various algorithm types and their 
practical applications in project management. This exploration aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps and contribute 
to the advancement of deep learning applications, fostering a harmonious integration of advanced artificial intelligence 
technologies with the indispensable expertise of project managers and their teams.

Abstract 
 
This work addresses the problem of the optimal integration of distributed photovoltaic generators (PV) and distributed 
static compensators (D-STATCOM) in electrical distribution systems (EDS), a complex challenge due to the 
nonlinearity of the mathematical models that describe both their operation and the integration of operational and 
investment costs, while adhering to the operational constraints of these devices. To solve this problem, a two-stage 
solution methodology is proposed: the first stage employs the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA), and the second utilizes 
a matrix power flow method based on successive approximations. The main objective is to minimize operational and 
annual investment costs through the optimal operation of photovoltaic generators and D-STATCOM devices. 
Although various researchers have proposed similar methodologies with the same goal, many of these studies lack 
robustness and do not include statistical analyses to evaluate the quality of the solutions obtained. In this study, a 
comparative statistical analysis is conducted with different optimization algorithms from specialized literature,",,,african 2025

Abstract  
 
Injection molding is a widely used manufacturing process for producing plastic components with high precision and 
efficiency. However, optimizing mold design and machining parameters remains a critical challenge to ensure product 
quality and minimize defects. This study focuses on the optimization of CNC machining parameters for efficient mold 
design and validation in injection molding. By using CAD/CAM software for mold fabrication and employing Fusion 
360 simulations for plastic flow analysis, this research aims to enhance mold performance and production efficiency. 
The study explores key factors such as material selection, machining strategies, and injection molding conditions to 
minimize defects like warpage, sink marks, and short shots. Experimental validation through prototype testing and 
simulation-driven optimization demonstrates significant improvements in mold accuracy and defect reduction. The 
findings of this research provide valuable insights into cost-effective and high-precision mold manufacturing, making 
it particularly relevant for small-scale production using desktop injection molding machines.

1.Introduction 
Plastic products became very common in modern live. It started replacing metal products in specific as it is lighter in 
weight, less expensive, more available and easier to shape. These advantages lead to a 70 percent of consumer products 
being produced by polymer production business. One of the techniques of creating a plastic product is plastic injection 
molding, which is injecting melted plastic into a mold that have the shape of the required product. The injection 
molding process has become an indispensable tool in modern manufacturing, enabling the efficient production of a 
vast array of plastic products. However, the success of this process hinges on the quality of the molds used. The design","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Table 2.  Injection pressure results at two different injection points 
 
 
 
Observations: There are two observations in Table 3 . The first observation is that the first injection point provides a 
lower injection pressure except in the first and second bowl scoops. The second observation is eliminating the holes 
in shovel scoop and 15 ml scoop reduced the injection pressure by 4.7 MPa and 1 MPa respectively. 
 
Conclusions:  
1. The first injection point is the optimum point for injection 
2. Eliminating the holes and grooves from the design results in a lower injection pressure as the flow 
of the molten plastic in the mold will flow smoothly without interruptions. 
3. The 15 ml capacity and 9.3 MPa injection pressure are the most suitable results across the scoop 
designs 
 
After selecting the 15 ml to be injected further optimization is made to reach a lower pressure, this is made by 
changing the melt temperature and mold temperature in simulations and observe the injection pressure response to 
these changes. 
 
Table 3.  Injection pressure of 15 ml scoop at different melt and mold temperatures 
 
 
Observations:  
1. At melt temperature of 240°C and mold temperature of 50 the part has the lowest injection pressure 
2. The part has a higher injection pressure after decreasing the mold temperature to 30°C 
Conclusions: 
1. As melt temperature increase the injection pressure decreases because the molten plastic in the sprue 
solidifies slower than usual so less injection pressure is needed. 
2. As mold temperature increase the injection pressure decreases because the wall of the mold keeps 
the material molten for a longer time which makes the flow easier and reduces the shear rate. 
 
Each part in the mold is manufactured and assembled, the core has a thickness of 60 mm while the cavity has a 
thickness of 30 mm leaving a 60 mm gap between the core and the cavity while ejection of the part.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
 
The present investigation develops a comprehensive solution to improve logistics management in the Scottish 
Distributor, located in Arequipa, Peru, which has 8,45% of damaged products, more than double the sector standard 
(3%), the company faces losses significant and operational challenges. Identified causes include inefficient warehouse 
layout, lack of inventory classification, and lack of clear handling procedures.The study uses key industrial 
engineering tools. Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) reorganizes the warehouse, improving material flow and 
reducing unnecessary manipulations by 40%. The ABC Matrix, based on product rotation, optimizes inventory 
distribution, reducing stacking damage by 21%. Finally, Standardized Work establishes clear procedures, reducing 
human errors by 13%.The results include a reduction in the percentage of damaged products to 3.92%, exceeding the 
proposed goal. This achievement translates into projected economic savings of more than five million soles annually, 
highlighting the financial and operational viability of the improvements. The research contributes to literature by 
combining these tools in an emerging distribution sector, validating their effectiveness through simulations with Arena 
software.This comprehensive approach offers a replicable model for companies facing similar problems, establishing 
a robust framework for future research on sustainability and advanced technology in warehouse management.

1. Introduction 
Logistics management is a critical aspect in the beverage distribution industry, as it directly impacts profitability, 
operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Companies face constant challenges due to inefficient handling, 
poor warehouse design, and the lack of standardization in their processes. In this context, damaged products represent 
a significant problem that affects both operational costs and service quality. 
The Beverage Distributor faces a critical challenge, as it currently has a 5,45% gap above the damaged product rate 
in storage, while the industry standard is 3%. This issue not only impacts the company’s profitability but also 
compromises customer satisfaction and logistics efficiency. 
 
The main problem identified at the Scottish Distributor is the high percentage of damaged products (8,45%), which 
exceeds the industry standard (3%). This issue stems from three main causes:

• 
Scope Expansion: Apply these tools to other areas of the logistics chain, such as distribution and 
transportation, to further optimize processes. 
• 
Cross-Industry Comparison: Conduct studies in other industries to validate the universality of the results and 
explore specific adjustments based on the sector.

Abstract 
 
The intersection of supply chain management (SCM) and entrepreneurship has garnered significant scholarly 
attention due to its potential to drive innovation and sustainability. This systematic literature review (SLR) 
explores the evolving relationship between these interconnected fields, with a focus on how entrepreneurial 
approaches influence sustainable supply chain practices. By analysing key studies, this review highlights the 
critical role of circular entrepreneurship (CEE) in embedding circular economy (CE) principles within SCM, 
fostering innovative business models, improving resource efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and 
promoting recycling within supply chains (SCs). Furthermore, the review examines the contributions of small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs) to sustainable and green supply chain practices, demonstrating how entrepreneurial 
efforts can establish more eco-friendly manufacturing processes. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis 
of current research, identifies gaps in the literature, and proposes directions for future studies at the nexus of SCM 
and entrepreneurship.",,,african 2025

Abstract 
 
Operational Excellence (OpEx) has become a cornerstone of modern industry, prompting numerous manufacturing 
companies, particularly in the Moroccan automotive sector, to adopt it to optimize costs and maximize profits. 
However, the lack of prior studies on OpEx implementation often leads to significant obstacles. This research aims to 
identify the critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing OpEx in Moroccan automotive companies. By doing so, 
it seeks to maximize the chances of success and evaluate the impact of OpEx before its widespread deployment. Based 
on theoretical and practical knowledge of OpEx CSFs and considering cultural factors, this study presents the results 
of an exploratory research. A questionnaire was developed, validated, and distributed to 265 individuals in various 
managerial positions across all Moroccan automotive companies, with an 93% response rate. This study fills a 
significant gap in the literature by examining, on a large scale, the adoption and integration of the OpEx approach 
within Moroccan automotive companies, thus contributing significantly to academics, OpEx practitioners, and 
performance optimization researchers.

Success Factors (CSFs).  
 
Introduction  
In an increasingly competitive economic environment, performance has become a strategic imperative for businesses. 
While traditionally associated with productivity and profitability, performance now encompasses broader dimensions 
such as customer satisfaction, innovation, and social responsibility. As (Issor 2017) points out, performance is 
measured by a company's ability to achieve its objectives while optimizing the use of its resources. (Berrah 2013) 
further argues that performance is not merely about efficiency and effectiveness but also about effectiveness, meaning 
alignment with the company's strategy. 
 
Operational Excellence, closely linked to performance, aims to optimize processes, improve quality, and reduce costs. 
It is rooted in a continuous improvement approach, where the company constantly strives to surpass itself. Company 
performance is a dynamic concept that goes beyond simply measuring financial results. It now integrates social and 
environmental dimensions and is closely linked to Operational Excellence. Similarly, cultural adaptation is essential. 
Previous research highlights that simply copying foreign models is insufficient. OpEx must be adapted to the 
Moroccan socio-cultural context, taking into account the specificities of the local industrial fabric. As (Anvari et al. 
2011) and (Liker  et al. 2012) point out, simply imitating foreign models is doomed to fail.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

context, with a score of 75.60%. This result aligns with previous empirical research on OpEx success factors, which 
has consistently demonstrated a positive relationship between management attitudes and actions and desired OpEx 
outcomes. Effective leadership mobilizes employees, manages resistance, and creates an environment conducive to 
adopting new practices (Liker 2004; Lu, et al. 2011; Brow 2013; Friedli, et al. 2013; Jaeger et al. 2014; Yew et al. 
2014; Carvalho et al. 2017; Alkhalidi et al. 2018; Aguilera  et al. 2019) 
 
The survey findings, backed by a strong consensus among employees, identify the critical factors for achieving 
Operational Excellence in the Moroccan automotive sector. By focusing on these fundamental elements, companies 
can foster a culture of continuous improvement, strong leadership, and employee engagement, leading to superior 
operational performance, higher product quality, and a sustainable competitive advantage in a dynamic industrial 
landscape. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study aims to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing Operational Excellence (OpEx) in the 
Moroccan automotive industry. Through a survey of 588 employees from 246 companies, the study highlighted 
several key factors. The allocation of sufficient resources to improvement projects emerged as the most critical factor, 
followed by strong management commitment and leadership. The study also emphasizes the importance of a culture 
of continuous improvement, employee training, and the involvement of all levels of the organization. These findings 
underscore the need for a comprehensive and strategic approach to OpEx in the Moroccan context. Adapting methods 
and tools to the specific realities of the sector and organizational culture is crucial. Moreover, the study highlights the 
importance of strong leadership commitment and employee engagement for successful OpEx implementation.  
 
This research contributes to a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities of adopting OpEx in the 
Moroccan automotive sector, providing guidance for companies seeking to improve their performance.

Abstract 
 
Accurate demand forecasting significantly benefits the food and beverage industry – minimizing waste, optimizing 
inventory, and meeting market demands. Traditional forecasting methods fail to capture non-linear relationships and 
external factors such as holidays, weather conditions, and macroeconomic factors. This study developed a machine 
learning-based forecasting framework by working on alcoholic beverages as a representative product category, given 
its growing per capita consumer spending and consumption. The research aimed to evaluate the performance of 
different ML models in comparison to one another and other traditional forecasting techniques. The models also 
incorporated feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictions and were assessed through different 
accuracy metrics. Results demonstrated that XGBoost excelled in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Feature 
selection using correlation enhanced computational efficiency but led to a slight reduction in forecast accuracy. 
Additionally, hyperparameter tuning methods of Random Search outperformed Grid Search in both accuracy and 
execution time. Overall, the study recommended adding more factors, leveraging algorithms for other applications, 
incorporating hyperparameter tuning, and investing in data.

Abstract 
 
This study focuses on enhancing the level of service in medical consultations at MedSalud Medical Center through 
the implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies. MedSalud currently faces challenges such as excessive waiting 
times, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of automation in administrative processes. Using the DMAIC framework, 
key problem areas were identified, including inefficient manual processes and limited operational capacity. Solutions 
include automating patient registration, optimizing physical space with Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), and 
standardizing processes. Indicators such as average waiting time, consultation duration, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
were used to measure effectiveness. The proposed improvements aim to reduce waiting times from 67 to 49 minutes, 
align consultation times with industry standards, and increase patient satisfaction by 10.87 percentage points. This 
research highlights the potential of Lean Six Sigma to improve efficiency and patient experience in medical centers, 
ensuring sustainable operational practices.

1. Introduction 
Healthcare service quality plays a critical role in patient outcomes and overall satisfaction, yet many medical centers 
struggle to meet efficiency and satisfaction benchmarks due to operational inefficiencies and outdated processes. At 
MedSalud Medical Center, the average waiting time for consultations is 67 minutes—considerably higher than 
industry standards. This not only affects patient satisfaction but also the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the 
center. Given the growing demand for accessible and high-quality healthcare, addressing these inefficiencies is 
imperative for providing better service and achieving sustainable operations.MedSalud faces several challenges that 
hinder its ability to deliver optimal healthcare services. Key issues include a lack of automation in administrative 
processes, limited medical personnel, insufficient infrastructure, and an outdated patient management system. These 
factors result in prolonged waiting times, low Net Promoter Scores (NPS) of 39.13%, and inefficient resource 
utilization. Additionally, the center's inability to expand its service offerings due to physical and operational limitations 
exacerbates the problem. 
 
This research aims to address these issues by leveraging Lean Six Sigma methodologies to identify inefficiencies, 
propose targeted solutions, and validate improvements through measurable outcomes. The study not only contributes","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies at MedSalud 
Medical Center achieved significant advancements in improving the quality of medical consultation services, 
addressing the main operational challenges identified. During the Define phase, the root causes of inefficiencies, such 
as prolonged waiting times and limited infrastructure capacity, were diagnosed using tools like the Ishikawa Diagram. 
These tools provided a comprehensive understanding of the issues, laying the groundwork for selecting specific 
solutions. In the Improve phase, the interventions implemented included process automation through ticket kiosks and 
advanced software, as well as physical space redistribution using Systematic Layout Planning (SLP). According to 
estimates obtained from simulations in Arena, these improvements reduced the average waiting time from 61 minutes 
to 46.75 minutes and shortened the average consultation time from 40 minutes to 28 minutes. Although the achieved 
Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 48.75% fell short of the projected goal of 50%, this result represents significant progress, 
highlighting the positive impact of the interventions on the patient experience and establishing a foundation for future 
enhancements. 
 
Additionally, the analyses and simulations validated the sustainability of these improvements, emphasizing how 
resource optimization and reorganization of the care flow directly contribute to operational efficiency. This study not 
only offers a replicable framework for clinics with similar characteristics but also underscores the importance of 
systematic approaches to addressing inefficiencies in healthcare environments with limited resources. Ultimately, 
MedSalud has demonstrated its commitment to operational excellence and continuous improvement, moving towards 
higher standards of quality and patient satisfaction.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

1. Introduction  
Industries are adopting advanced technologies to enhance automation and, productivity, reduce costs, and improve 
traceability and reliability (Mohamed & Al-Jaroodi 2019). Technologies such as cloud computing, fog computing, 
IoT, blockchain, cyber-physical systems, and data analytics offer manufacturing benefits (Hamzah et al.  2023). Smart 
manufacturing creates a connected network that improves operations. Product recalls and failures negatively impact 
manufacturers’ sales and reputation, making it essential to address these challenges early (Bortoli & Freundt 
2017). The Wall Street Journal highlighted the significance of blockchain (Kursh & Gold 2016), with a predicted 
market growth of $176 billion by 2025 (Kramer 2019), prompting this research on its application in product lifecycle 
management. Therefore, this research therefore investigates through a literature review the application of blockchain 
technology in manufacturing to support the ideals of product lifecycle management. The research looks at different 
research articles that investigated the application of blockchain technology as solution to address manufacturing 
concerns.",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
 
Purpose: The objective of this research is to identify risk issues in hotel projects in China as seen through the views 
of hotel managers and to propose targeted recommendations. We use the lens of project management to understand 
the risks in the Chinese hospitality industry which is quickly evolving due to a surging economy. 
Design/methodology/approach: To accomplish the research objectives, a qualitative approach was utilized. We 
conducted 8 semi-structured interviews with hotel managers in China to understand the nature of risks and risk 
management practices they employ to manage them. We use thematic descriptive analysis to unpack the interviews. 
Findings: The key findings of this study indicate that: the risks associated with the hotel projects are broadly consistent 
with those associated with the hotel industry; the hotel projects are subject to high financial and security risks; the 
complexity of hotel project risk stems from customer behavior and human resource, and the hotel project risk could 
be a threat or an opportunity. Originality/value Based on the findings, this study presents a risk management model 
for hotel projects that differs from the general risk management process by including customer communication and 
the influence on the hotel's day-to-day operations.

1. Introduction  
The expansion of the tourism business in any country can create jobs and produce foreign exchange profits for the 
national economy (Kaliti 2015). The tourism industry has dining, entertainment, accommodation, transport, and 
shopping functions. And the hotel sector is the only one that integrates all these functions into one. It can be said that 
the hotel industry is a representative sector of the tourism industry. In recent years, the hotel industry has seen 
tremendous growth worldwide. In Asian countries, particularly China, the hotel business and hotel management are 
facing considerable challenges. With economic development and technological advances, customer demand for","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Based on: Project lifecycle (Kevin 2021) and risk management process (PMI 2017).Combining efficiency-oriented 
project risk management with service-oriented hotel operation management can not only help the successful 
completion of hotel projects but also improve the efficiency of hotel operations, thus allowing hotels to remain highly 
competitive. It can be argued that project risk management is very important to the success of a hotel in the quickly 
evolving and fiercely competitive business world of today. However, it is not enough to operate the principles and 
tools of project risk management within a hotel project. It is important to emphasize that risk management in projects 
will not succeed if there is no risk awareness in the organizational culture (Giorgetto 2021). Hotel managers must 
therefore introduce risk awareness at a strategic corporate level, develop a risk culture and train the organization’s 
staff in understanding the complexities with scope creep (Quah & Prabhakar 2008). As mentioned in the literature 
review, soft skills are just as important to the effectiveness of project risk management as hard skills. 
 
7. Conclusion  
This study is set out to explore project risk management in hotel projects from the view of hotel managers in China. 
The objectives of this study are divided into two parts: exploring the current situation and making recommendations. 
Exploring the current situation entails investigating the hotel project, its risk factors, and the current state of hotel 
project risk management. Making recommendations entails making sound recommendations for the use of project risk 
management in hotel projects while taking the theoretical basis and the characteristics of hotel projects into account. 
To answer these questions, a qualitative method with semi-structured interviews was used. 
 
Firstly, this study identified the hotel projects that hotel managers encounter in their work (Table 3). It was also 
discovered that the hotel business currently implements projects independently of the day-to-day operations of the 
hotel and that most hotel managers are unaware of the projects. Secondly, this study classified the risk issues present 
in hotel projects (Table 4). The general risk issues observed in this study were identified and grouped into 11 categories 
and categorized as systemic and unsystematic risks. Within systemic risk, there are five risk categories: political, 
economic, environmental, technology, and covid-19. Unsystematic risks are subdivided into six categories: finance, 
demand, security, supply chain, customer behavior, and human resource risks. These risk categories in hotel projects 
are numerous and complex and interact with each other. And they are almost identical to the risks that exist in hotel 
operations.  
 
This shows that studying risk management in hotel projects is not only helpful for the smooth implementation and 
success of hotel projects, but also contributes to risk management in hotel operations, and even in the hotel industry.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025

For the practical application of risk management in hotel projects, this study found that although hotel managers do 
not have the concept of a systematic risk management process, they all implement risk assessment and treatment in 
the project planning and implementation phases. However, their risk management is static, with single actions. 
Combined with the fact that many of the previously identified risks can be avoided or controlled through sound 
management. Naturally, the importance of project risk management to the success of a hotel project is reflected. 
In line with the second objective of this study, the researcher proposed a hotel project risk management model (figure 
6). The model combines efficiency-oriented project risk management with service-oriented hotel operations 
management and emphasizes the importance of communication with consumers, which provides practical 
recommendations for risk management in hotel projects. 
 
This study contains several limitations that must be considered due to time, geographical location, language, and other 
factors. The first limitation stems from the way data were collected due to geographical constraints. Interviews by 
phone or online do not build trust with the interviewee quickly and tend to miss out on some useful information, 
compared to face-to-face conversations. The researcher made efforts to reduce the impact of this limitation by 
repeatedly confirming with respondents the completeness and accuracy of the information collected. This study's data 
collection was entirely in Chinese, and data analysis was based on the translated information. During the translation 
process, expression bias and mistranslation of proper nouns may occur, limiting the accuracy of the study's results. 
The most significant limitation of this study is the small sample size. The eight respondents in this study were all from 
branded hotel chains in first-tier cities in China, which is small sample size for the large Chinese hotel market. This 
limits the comprehensive collation of hotel projects and the in-depth analysis of risk issues in this study. Therefore, 
one suggestion for future research is to examine more participants and improve the generalizability of the findings on 
this research topic. 
 
Project risk management is essential to maintain a high level of competitiveness in a highly competitive environment. 
Therefore, it is very important that future research explores the application of project risk management in the day-to-
day operations of hotels. Project management is not just about installation or refurbishment or upgrading; project 
management is a philosophy of management and is about the culture of an organization. It is also very important that 
future research explores the application of other principles of project management to the hotel industry.

The current competitive environment is drawing increasing attention to green logistics. Road transport is a significant 
source of carbon emissions, which contribute to environmental pollution. Multi-objective algorithms are typically 
used to represent transportation problems like the Green Capacity Vehicle Routing Problem (GCVRP). These 
problems are NP-difficult and provide a Pareto front with incomparable solutions. In this context and in order to divert 
these issues, the purpose of this article is to propose a new approach to modeling the GCVRP problem in the form of 
single-objective programming. The idea is to look for the shortest path in a new virtual graph that is designed by 
integrating CO2 emissions into actual distances. This new modeling approach facilitates digital resolution and 
decision-making. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the model. In addition, the calculation time and the 
quality of the solution are much better.

Introduction 
The transportation system has become a crucial link in a logistics chain as a result of rising freight quantities brought 
on by expanding populations, technology, internationalization of markets, and globalization. One of the biggest issues 
facing the logistics industry is to improve the effectiveness of freight logistics while reducing the energy use of existing 
logistics systems and transforming them to be environmentally friendly. Meanwhile, the logistics process aims to 
reduce the cost of transportation by reducing factors like journey time, distance, and reliability. Additionally reducing 
air pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2). The construction of a set of routes for a fleet of vehicles carrying items 
to a set of clients falls under the broad category of challenges known as vehicle routing. Finding a set of ideal routes 
for a fleet of similar vehicles (with fixed capacity) that, from a central depot, service the demand of the customers is 
the fundamental model of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that we explore in this article (Toth and Vigo 2002). 
 
The green vehicle routing problem (GVRP) is described by (Lin et al. 2014) as a way to apply effective routes to 
address financial indices and environmental issues while balancing the economic and environmental costs. The Green 
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (GCVRP), one of the GVRP's versions and one of the most significant 
transportation challenges in logistics, is presented in this article. The goal is to serve a limited number of clients. 
Taking into account a fleet of vehicles with uniform and limited capacities while reducing overall transportation costs 
and CO2 emissions. Only for cases of small sizes can we solve the extremely NP-hard GCVRP accurately and 
optimally using exact methods. Heuristic and meta-heuristic methods are therefore used to develop workable and 
good, but not necessarily guaranteed, optimal solutions while consuming reasonable amounts of processing time. CO₂ 
emissions and fuel usage are influenced by a number of factors, including individual driving style, vehicle and road 
types, vehicle load, distance traveled, traffic circumstances, etc. Additionally, fuel usage and speed of the vehicle also","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

more thorough evaluation of the method's scalability and usefulness. To address these larger cases, we intend to use 
more sophisticated metaheuristics in subsequent work. The approach will be improved, and its efficacy in resolving 
real-world issues will be ensured by the use of metaheuristics, which are renowned for their capacity to effectively 
explore vast and intricate solution spaces. By bridging the gap between theoretical validation and real-world 
implementation, this process will offer a more thorough review. 
 
      5. Conclusion 
To conclude, this article introduces a new approach to model the GCVRP, the proposed model is mono-objective 
minimizing the total virtual traveled distance, including the number of CO2 emissions. The article presents the 
methodology adopted to quantify CO2 emissions in distance and the passage from a GCVRP multi-objective that 
minimizes two objectives, distance and CO2 emissions to a Virtual GCVRP mono-objective minimizing only one 
objective which is the virtual traveled distance. The M2 model has given good results justifying the possibility and 
feasibility of the methodology proposed in this work. An improvement of the introduced model plus a validation on 
large instances is necessary to have better visibility which will be presented in next works.

Abstract 
 
Sustainability and sustainable development are becoming more popular in the literature and are applied in many 
sectors since environmental concerns have increased globally. Consequently, sustainability concerns have started to 
focus on shipyards, where all ships are constructed, repaired, maintained, and dismantled. Since 90% of world trade 
merchandise is transported by ships, the shipbuilding sector has been concerned with energy efficiency and focused 
on either environment or emission-oriented research. However, sustainability has three dimensions: environmental, 
social, and economic. Each innovation and transformation have a positive or negative impact on each of those 
dimensions. In addition, the shipyards should implement a simple approach or initiative to reach the necessary 
sustainability targets. Therefore, the authors proposed modeling of identified indicators determined by the experts and 
used an analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method to prioritize the dimensions and indicators. The model is applied 
in a shipyard, and the economic dimension with profitability and revenue indicators was found to be significant. The 
shipyard evaluates environmental issues from an economic and social point of view, as shipyards face fierce global 
competition and the challenge of ensuring the availability of skilled labor with a minimum of accidents. Surprisingly, 
environmental dimensions are not at the forefront because shipyards are not obliged to respect international standards 
like ports and ships sailing on the overseas.

1. Introduction 
The sustainability concept emerged in 1987 regarding Brundtland reports. After that report, governmental and non-
governmental organizations, academicians, and private sector executives started to examine the subject in detail, and 
many studies, approaches, and reports were published as an outcome of these efforts. In 1995, the intention of United 
Nations meetings evolved into seventeen sustainable development goals. Conference of Parties (COP) meetings were 
held every 4 years, so the awareness about sustainability increased globally and the governments, international 
institutions, local and national corporations, entities, and academicians have started to act to decrease unexpected 
effects of environmental pollution, economic constraints, and social unrest.

5. Conclusion 
Sustainability and sustainable development have gained importance globally. The shipyards where the ships are 
constructed, maintained, repaired, and dismantled are confronting new regulations, standards, or requirements about 
environment and sustainability due to the IMO emissions targets or international or local regulatory bodies and 
administrations. The shipyards are aware of these challenges and act to adapt to new situations. Regarding the incident, 
this study first aimed to evaluate the weighting of sustainability performance and then the performance indicators of 
each dimension, environmental, social, and economic respectively.  
 
The findings are summarized in Table 8. It is evident that the shipyards continue to emphasize the economic issues 
and then social issues of sustainability and sustainable dimension although the environmental issues are usually in the 
front to discuss. The reason is that shipyards engage in environmental issues but act regarding economic (mainly profit 
indicators) and social (mainly cost of labor force indicator) issues. The profitability indicator (Eco3) is ranked first 
position among the other performance indicators, enhancing the argument above. Revenue (Eco2) is in the second 
rank because it is one of the most important financial metrics that measure the company's performance and growth. 
Employee wages and benefits (Soc2) is the third indicator in the model and emphasizes the labor force's importance 
for revenue and profitability. The fourth indicator is Material cost (Eco4) which is also an important variable for 
profitability. Then comes work accidents (Soc4) because the accident rate has a linear and negative effect on a 
company's economic performance, Estudillo, et al. (2024)Estudillo, et al. (2024). Energy consumption (Env1) is 
ranked in the 6th position since shipbuilding is an energy-intensive sector, Vakili, et al. (2021). The other indicators 
ranking are Scrap recycled (Eco2), Average hours of training per employee (Soc1), Greenhouse gas emissions (Env4), 
attendance and absence days (Soc3), Hazardous waste (Env3), and Scrap recycled (Env4), respectively.

In conclusion, the shipyards evaluate environmental issues from economic and social views since shipyards confront 
a global competition Mickeviciene (2011) and challenge to guarantee of qualified labor force availability with 
minimum accident, Barlas, et al. (2018). Surprisingly, environmental dimensions are not at the forefront because 
shipyards are not obliged to respect international standards like ports and ships sailing on the overseas.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
 
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) represent a powerful Generative AI tool that learns the underlying structure of input 
data and generates new data. This paper applies VAEs to model complex, real-world demand distributions in the 
context of inventory management. Existing research often relies on traditional methods, such as linear regression or 
Gaussian mixture models, which frequently struggle to capture the non-linear and multimodal nature of actual demand 
patterns. VAEs utilize deep neural networks to learn intricate patterns within data and map them to a regularized latent 
space, enabling the generation of novel demand scenarios. Consequently, using VAEs could result in finding the 
optimal order quantity more accurately. We hypothesize that VAEs empower businesses to make data-driven decisions 
to optimize inventory levels and minimize costs, providing a robust and adaptable framework for inventory 
management compared to traditional approaches. To test our hypothesis, we simulate ten sets of demand distributions 
with complex patterns and shapes and use VAEs to model these demand patterns. Based on the distributions identified 
by the VAEs, we calculate the optimal order quantity and expected profits. We then compare these results to scenarios 
where demand is assumed to follow traditional distributions, including Normal, Poisson, Erlang, and Uniform 
distributions. Our findings reveal that, in most cases, the VAE-based approach outperforms the approaches that use 
traditional distributional assumptions. This research demonstrates the potential of VAEs to contribute to inventory 
management by providing a more accurate and flexible approach to modeling demand variability, ultimately leading 
to significant cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

1.Introduction 
The increasing complexity and dynamism of business environments necessitate effective inventory management for 
firms to maximize profitability and ensure quality operations. However, firms face significant challenges in aligning 
inventory levels with uncertain demand, often resulting in overstocking or stockouts (Hao 2024). Traditional models, 
such as the Newsvendor model, remain widely used due to their analytical tractability and practical applicability.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025

4.Conclusion 
The comparison between the two approaches—one using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate the demand 
distribution and the other assuming a normal distribution—demonstrates the clear advantages of the VAE-based 
method. The profit trends in the VAE-generated model exhibit greater stability and higher average profitability 
compared to the normal distribution approach, which shows more fluctuations and lower overall profits. This suggests 
that the normal distribution assumption may oversimplify the underlying demand structure, failing to capture complex 
variations and real-world uncertainties. In contrast, the VAE effectively learns intricate demand patterns from data, 
allowing for a more precise estimation of the true demand distribution. This, in turn, leads to more informed inventory 
decisions and improved profitability in the newsvendor setting. 
 
Future research can explore further enhancements to the VAE framework, such as incorporating additional external 
factors like seasonality, economic trends, and competitor behavior into the model to refine demand estimation. 
Additionally, integrating reinforcement learning with VAEs could provide adaptive decision-making strategies that 
dynamically adjust inventory levels based on real-time data. Investigating the robustness of VAEs in handling sparse 
or limited data scenarios is another promising direction, as real-world demand data may often be incomplete or noisy. 
Overall, our findings highlight the potential of deep learning models in supply chain optimization, paving the way for 
more intelligent and data-driven inventory management solutions.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract  
 
Higher education is an evolutionary context demonstrating continuously new engaging expectations to boost the 
educational system’s performance and improve its quality and adaptability to current professional needs.Health care 
and nursing programs main objective is to develop the theoretical and practical scope of the technical and soft skills 
to meet the latest health care sector requirements. Therefore, many challenges are facing students and the academic 
staff as well within the emergence of Artificial Intelligence tools and digitalized systems raising new questions and 
addressing new learning methodologies. Simulation of diverse clinical situations in an interactive way could enhance 
the practical learning via the virtual care experience bringing closer the professional environment and allowing to 
detect and manage student mistakes and observed deviations before the real experience. The AI deployment is 
effectively bringing out a new pedagogical framework that should balance and optimize the use of AI and digital tools 
to serve learning purposes without flowing over other real nursing practices or real trainings.

Abstract 
 
In the Philippines, jeepneys are a key mode of transportation, accounting for 40% of public motorized trips. Launched 
in 2017, the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) proposed modern jeepneys to address air 
pollution, enhance passenger safety, and alleviate traffic congestion. The Bureau of Philippine Standards issued 
specifications for four classes of modern jeepneys, focusing on dimensional limits. Despite millions of Filipinos using 
the Jeepneys, daily exposure to poorly designed jeepneys can lead to Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) among 
passengers, affecting their ability to work effectively and safely. Existing studies indicate that discrepancies in seat 
design and measurement exacerbate MSDs. To assess whether modern jeepneys align with the anthropometric 
measurements of Filipino commuters, researchers collected various dimensions, including seat height, depth, and 
backrest height. The researchers measured 120 Filipino passengers, obtaining eight key anthropometric measurements 
such as popliteal height and sitting shoulder height. Using z-tests for analysis, it was found that seat width and ceiling 
height had the lowest percentage of unfit users. A mismatch analysis was created, utilizing the 5th and 95th percentiles 
of the anthropometric measurements to offer recommendations for improving modern jeepney dimensions. This 
research highlights the importance of ergonomic design in public transportation to enhance passenger comfort and 
prevent the onset of MSDs.

Table 6 summarizes the proposed modern jeepney dimensions relative to its anthropometric measurements. The 
analysis for these numbers is as follows: the proposed seat height of 37 cm resulted in 99.78% male and 92.07% 
female comfortability, the proposed seat depth of 32.3 cm resulted in 99.97% male and 94.18% female comfortability, 
the proposed upper seat width of 50.2 cm resulted in 93.19% male and 95.15% female comfortability, the proposed 
ceiling height of 180 cm resulted in 96.33% male and 99.84% comfortability, and the proposed seat width of 43.8 cm 
resulted in 100% male and 95.54% female comfortability. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the study highlights significant ergonomic issues in passenger seating and modern jeepney design, 
particularly concerning upper seat width and ceiling height in class 1 modern jeepneys. These shortcomings lead to 
passenger discomfort and increased injury risk, as current dimensions do not align with Filipino anthropometric 
measurements. Poor ergonomic design affects factors like posture, legroom, and cushioning, resulting in health issues 
such as musculoskeletal strains. Using Gaussian probability distribution, the study identified the percentage of Filipino 
passengers experiencing discomfort with existing measurements. Proposed adjustments to seat height, depth, width, 
and ceiling height, as detailed in Table 5, aim to enhance travel comfort for Filipino commuters.

Abstract 
 
Signal Detection Theory (SDT) is a valuable framework for studying decision-making processes. In this research, 
SDT was applied to evaluate the decision skills of medical students in diagnosing trauma radiography. To assess their 
performance, pre-test and post-test evaluations were conducted, providing each student with 50 trauma radiographic 
images (25 depicting injuries and 25 without injuries). The students were required to indicate whether they observed 
an injury or not. Based on their responses, the students' behaviors were categorized as liberal, conservative, or optimal, 
with the latter representing the desired behavior. The actual response bias and sensitivity were calculated for each 
student and compared the results between the pre-test and post-test stages. As a result, no optimal behaviors were 
observed during the pre-test; however, in the post-test, four students demonstrated optimal behaviors. An increase in 
conservative behavior among students during the post-test was observed, indicating an enhanced sense of awareness 
and caution. This change can be attributed to the focus and encouragement provided to the students throughout the 
study. Although no significant differences were found in the actual response bias values between the pre-test and post-
test, noteworthy behavioral changes were observed. By employing SDT, this research highlights the decision-making 
abilities of medical students in trauma radiography diagnosis. The findings indicate that targeted interventions and 
training programs can play a vital role in improving decision-making skills. Further investigations are warranted to 
explore effective strategies for fostering optimal decision-making behaviors among medical students in radiographic 
diagnosis.

Abstract 
 
This study analyzed the perceptions of undergraduate students living in student housing in the City of Manila regarding 
emergency and disaster preparedness as they faced various challenges when it comes to emergency response given 
the nature of their living arrangement. The researchers examined how these perceptions affect their responses to 
emergencies, focusing on factors such as personal experiences, prior training, climate change awareness, and the roles 
of local governments and universities in disaster response and management. Using stratified random sampling, surveys 
were distributed online and on-site, with data analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings reveal 
that while students recognize the importance of preparedness, many lack confidence in their ability to respond 
effectively. Factors such as the frequency and type of training received, familiarity with local emergency protocols, 
and understanding of climate-related risks significantly influence their perceived preparedness. The study emphasizes 
the need for improved training programs and stronger collaboration between universities and local governments to 
enhance disaster preparedness.  
 
Based on the results, the researchers recommend strengthening training programs, improving student awareness, and 
developing partnerships between academic institutions and disaster management authorities that will ultimately boost 
the overall disaster readiness and response of the students. Additionally, this study stresses the need for targeted 
strategies to bridge preparedness gaps, specifically among students in temporary housing near universities, and calls 
for further studies to address these critical issues.

A well-fitting model not only strengthens the credibility of the data but also enhances the robustness of the findings 
by accounting for dependent variable variances (Stone 2021). Furthermore, it provides a foundation for future 
research, offering a framework that can be expanded and refined in subsequent studies. A strong structural model adds 
to the overall quality of the study, ensuring that the relationships between variables were carefully considered and 
rigorously tested (Hooper et al. 2008). 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study assessed the disaster preparedness perceptions of undergraduate students in Manila’s student housing, 
focusing on the factors that influence their preparedness levels. It found that while many students felt confident in 
their preparedness, there were gaps between their perceived and actual ability to respond effectively to emergencies. 
Key factors such as compulsory disaster courses and knowledge of climate change were found to improve 
preparedness, while personal experiences and institutional safety measures had less impact. The study highlights the 
importance of education and training in disaster preparedness, offering recommendations for universities and local 
authorities to enhance programs and better equip students for emergencies. With this, the study may provide concerned 
authorities with the knowledge required to reinforce existing emergency preparedness tools that are taught or 
disseminated through various channels that ensure that members of the community can make informed decisions 
during emergencies.

Abstract 
 
Automation and precision are two main aspects of manufacturing; computer numerical control (CNC) milling 
machines are important machinery that must be in a workshop. First, a new CAD model was designed in Solidworks 
software with the required specifications. Afterwards, the materials were chosen to build a fully functioning CNC 
machine prototype. The second step was to set up the GRBL controller on an Arduino UNO. Then, the UGS platform 
was used as a G-code reader and as a user interface to access the GRBL controller. The third step was to build the 
prototype from the chosen materials. Finally, the last step was to wire the stepper motor drivers together with the 
power supply and the Arduino. As a result, the prototype was built and the machine achieved an accuracy of 0.01 mm.

1. Introduction  
National economic strength and productivity rely heavily on industrial manufacturing, which is being transformed by 
technologies such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and IoT. Countries such as U.S.A., Germany, 
and China have implemented strategies, such as Industry 4.0, to integrate advanced technologies for smarter, 
sustainable manufacturing. Milling, a critical subtractive process known for its high Material Removal Rate (MRR) 
and excellent surface finish, plays a key role in this evolution. CNC milling machines, widely used in aerospace, 
automotive, and mold manufacturing, utilize CAD and CAM software to manufacture complex parts with high 
precision in addition to minimizing reliance on the operator skill. Traditional ISO6983 programming for CNC 
machines is being replaced by STEP-NC (ISO14649), which integrates design and manufacturing data for improved 
performance. Variations in machine controllers, algorithms, and kinematics influence the efficiency and accuracy of 
CNC milling systems, underscoring the importance of innovation in manufacturing processes.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

4.5 Proposed Improvements 
The machine base structure needs to be 100 mm lower to work on hard materials like iron. Also, the X-axis and Z-
axis platforms can be machined from iron instead of aluminum profile to increase the rigidity of the machine. Finally, 
servo motors can be used instead of stepper motors for sending feedback. 
 
5. Conclusion  
In conclusion, it was found that high stability was obtained using concrete instead of cast iron. Also, the machine 
manufactured a workpiece using a G-code; the accuracy was 0.01 mm.

Abstract 
 
This research focuses on developing and characterizing a nutritional supplement in powder form derived from 
Ungurahui (Oenocarpus bataua) using freeze-drying processes. Native to the Peruvian Amazon, Ungurahui is rich in 
antioxidants, polyphenols, tocopherols, and healthy fatty acids, offering significant nutritional and functional benefits. 
A study by the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana highlights Ungurahui’s cardiovascular health 
benefits and its role in preventing cellular damage due to its high content of unsaturated fatty acids (81.50% of total 
fatty acids) and antioxidants (DPPH: 82.13 µmol TE/g fresh sample) (Vargas-Arana 2022). This study addresses food 
preservation challenges, such as perishability and nutrient retention, by utilizing lyophilization, which effectively 
preserves the fruit’s bioactive compounds and sensory properties. Objectives include evaluating the state of the art in 
Ungurahui and lyophilization, designing a freeze-drying methodology, and formulating a powder with enhanced 
antioxidants and sensory profiles. Experiments at the University of Lima included proximate analysis, antioxidant 
tests, and sensory evaluations. Results demonstrated lyophilization’s potential to produce a high-quality, shelf-stable 
powder with antioxidant levels exceeding 200 mg GAE/100 g. Market trends indicate increasing demand for health-
focused, convenient powder foods, with a 35% growth over the past five years. This research emphasizes innovation 
in Amazonian fruit utilization, promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing food waste. The final product is a 
freeze-dried Ungurahui powder nutritional supplement, preserving its nutritional, physicochemical, and organoleptic 
properties, ideal for applications in beverages, juices, and desserts.

Abstract 
 
 Optimizing incident energy at the surfaces of solar modules is one of the most important parts of energy extraction. 
The goal of the solar-energy maximization problem is to maximize the amount of solar energy that strikes the flat 
surfaces of conventional flat solar-PV modules. The amount of solar energy that strikes the surface of photovoltaic 
(PV) panels is determined by the tilt angle of the panels. The position of the sun, latitude, and regional topography all 
affect the optimal tilt angle. This article discusses the optimal fixed-tilt solar-PV system angles for the Saudi Arabian 
city of Najran (18.00o N, 45.40o E). In addition to using meteorological equipment at the engineering college of 
Najran University in Saudi Arabia, LSI also gathered data on the city of Najran's horizontal solar radiation from 
""Climate.OneBuilding.Org."" After evaluating the monthly, seasonal, and annual fixed-tilt choices, the optimum 
solution was selected. Najran's ideal annual tilt was determined to be 20.97 degrees. The annual ideal angle value was 
rather close to the latitude of the individual place. The range of 20.04 to 26.01 MJ/m2-day was discovered to be the 
average solar radiation at the annual optimal tilt. Based on monthly, seasonal, and annual ideal tilts, average annual 
solar radiation gains were projected to be 9.56%, 8.08%, and 3.32% higher than those of solar-PV modules put 
horizontally. In comparison to the optimal monthly tilt, the surface at seasonal and annual optimal tilts was predicted 
to lose 1.36% and 5.70% of its energy, respectively.

Abstract 
 
Cloud computing is one of the latest commercial ideas that has become popular and provides users with limitless 
access to virtual resources. Task scheduling in cloud computing refers to assigning VMs to cloud tasks. Due to service 
demand costs associated with the usage of software and hardware, such as bandwidth, storage, and processing, 
effective task scheduling and balancing the usage of VMs are essential for increasing data center efficiency and 
reducing energy consumption. Therefore, using an effective task scheduling algorithm that minimizes makespan and 
maximizes resource utilization is crucial. In many studies, different algorithms—such as Min-Min, Max-Min, and 
Adaptive Incremental Genetic Algorithm (AIGA)—have been developed to solve this problem, and these algorithms 
are used on many platforms. The goal of this study is to compare commonly used heuris tic-based algorithms, which 
include Min-Min and Max-Min, bio-inspired algorithm AIGA, and offer an exact solution guarantee through the 
Exhaustive Learning Optimization Algorithm (ELOA). With this aim, the instance types of Amazon EC2 have been 
used to implement virtual machines with various computing capacities on CloudSim. The results show that Min-Min 
and Max-Min algorithms provide computationally efficient feasible solutions, and AIGA also provides feasible 
solutions with adaptive and efficient processes. Finally, ELOA provides an optimal solution that minimizes makespan. 
This makes Min-Min, Max-Min, and AIGA suitable for large-scale task scheduling in cloud computing, while ELOA 
is a great choice for small-scale problems.

6. Conclusion  
To minimize the computational costs and conserve energy, efficient allocation of resources and the minimization of 
the time required to complete all the tasks, i.e. makespan, is crucial in the realm of cloud task scheduling. Among the 
strategies employed to address these challenges are the heuristic algorithms Min-Min and Max-Min, as well as the 
bio-inspired AIGA. While ELOA demands substantial computational power, it excels in smaller projects where 
sufficient resources are available. In order to identify the most efficient task order while ensuring the best possible 
outcome, this algorithm takes a constructive approach by thoroughly evaluates all possible task sequence. However, 
its exhaustive nature makes it computationally intensive. Our findings indicate that while heuristic-based algorithms 
like Min-Min, Max-Min, and AIGA operate efficiently and help control computing costs, they don’t always guarantee 
the optimal solution. For smaller-scale projects where precision is paramount, ELOA is often the superior choice, as 
it rigorously evaluates all potential solutions to find the best one. Among the heuristic approaches, AIGA performs 
closely to ELOA, while the Max-Min algorithm also proves to be a strong alternative. Notably, the makespan 
difference between Min-Min and ELOA can fluctuate more significantly than that between Max-Min and ELOA, 
highlighting the varying performance of these strategies across different cloud computing scenarios 
Further research could explore hybrid algorithms that merge the efficiency of heuristic methods with the thoroughness 
of exhaustive approaches. These hybrids may provide a well-balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and 
solution accuracy, especially for medium- to large-scale applications. Additionally, evaluating these algorithms in 
edge computing environments—where data is processed closer to its source—could be advantageous, given the 
growing role of edge computing in reducing latency for cloud services.

Abstract 
 
Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) has proven effective in enhancing the efficiency of resource-constrained 
and time-sensitive projects, especially in high-stakes environments such as military engineering. In the Corps of 
Engineers, Armed Forces of the Philippines (CEAFP), where complex infrastructure and disaster response projects 
often encounter delays and resource allocation inefficiencies, CCPM offers a systematic framework for improvement. 
This research integrates data from CEAFP’s Annual Reports to analyze CCPM’s potential applications and impacts 
on project outcomes. By reviewing case studies of two key projects—the construction of an ammunition dump and a 
disaster response facility—the study demonstrates CCPM’s ability to optimize project timelines, resource allocation, 
and fund utilization. Findings show a 15% improvement in resource efficiency and reduced project delays by 20%, 
highlighting CCPM’s role in fostering operational excellence within CEAFP’s engineering initiatives. 
Recommendations for institutionalizing CCPM within CEAFP’s project management processes are also discussed.

1. Introduction 
Military engineering projects under the CEAFP operate in environments characterized by uncertainty, limited 
resources, and stringent deadlines. The CEAFP’s dual role in national defense and development requires its 
engineering arm to execute projects such as barracks construction, road rehabilitation, disaster response facilities, and 
military infrastructure. However, these projects frequently face challenges, including budget constraints, resource 
conflicts, and delays in project completion. 
 
Traditional project management methods, such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Gantt chart scheduling, while 
effective in structured environments, often fall short in addressing dynamic and uncertain conditions prevalent in 
CEAFP projects. Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM), introduced by Goldratt (1997), offers a viable 
alternative by focusing on constraint management, buffer allocation, and critical chain prioritization. This study 
evaluates CCPM’s application in CEAFP projects, using data from the 2022 Annual Report to assess its impact on 
project performance, resource utilization, and fund efficiency.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

5. Discussion 
 
5.1 CCPM’s Relevance to CEAFP 
The data strongly support the applicability of CCPM within CEAFP's engineering project portfolio. CCPM's strategic 
focus on managing uncertainties through project buffers and prioritizing the critical chain aligns with the CEAFP’s 
mission of delivering timely infrastructure that supports both military readiness and humanitarian objectives. These 
efficiencies directly contribute to CEAFP’s broader goals under its national defense and socio-economic development 
mandates. 
 
5.2 Challenges and Limitations 
Adopting CCPM was not without challenges. Initial resistance to change and a lack of familiarity with CCPM 
principles among personnel posed early implementation barriers. Although the 2022 Annual Report highlights 
ongoing personnel development, it became evident that additional specialized training—especially in buffer 
management, task dependency analysis, and constraint identification—was essential to fully leverage CCPM's 
advantages. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
6.1 Conclusion 
The integration of Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) in the planning and execution of CEAFP engineering 
projects has yielded substantial gains in terms of schedule adherence, optimized resource utilization, and overall cost 
savings. The comparative analysis of projects before and after CCPM implementation—specifically the Ammunition 
Dump and Disaster Response Facility—revealed marked reductions in project duration and budget overruns, while 
also demonstrating increased operational efficiency. These outcomes provide empirical support for CCPM’s relevance 
as a systematic, scientifically grounded methodology tailored to the dynamic and resource-constrained conditions of 
military engineering environments. Thus, CCPM emerges as a transformative model for project delivery that aligns 
with the CEAFP's dual mandate of national defense readiness and socio-economic support through infrastructure 
development. 
 
6.2 Recommendations 
Institutionalizing CCPM. To fully leverage the advantages of CCPM, it is recommended that the approach be 
institutionalized within CEAFP’s standard project management framework. This entails embedding CCPM principles 
and practices into official project management guidelines, operational protocols, and organizational workflows. 
Formal adoption would ensure consistency in execution and foster a culture of disciplined planning, buffer 
management, and task prioritization. Institutionalization would also facilitate smoother collaboration across different 
units and stakeholders by providing a unified language and process model for managing engineering projects. 
 
Capacity Building. A critical component of sustaining CCPM implementation is capacity development among 
CEAFP personnel. As reflected in the 2022 Annual Report, ongoing training programs exist; however, these should 
be expanded to incorporate CCPM-specific modules. These modules should cover core concepts such as the 
identification of critical chains, buffer sizing and management, task dependency mapping, and resource constraint 
resolution. It is also recommended to adopt a tiered training structure, with introductory sessions for general staff and 
advanced workshops for project managers and technical officers. Simulation-based learning and case study analysis 
may further enhance conceptual understanding and practical application.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025  
Performance Monitoring. To evaluate the long-term impact of CCPM, CEAFP should develop and institutionalize 
a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) tailored to project efficiency and effectiveness. These KPIs may include 
metrics such as schedule variance, cost variance, buffer penetration, throughput rates, and stakeholder satisfaction 
levels. Integrating these indicators into a real-time performance dashboard would allow project managers to monitor 
deviations, conduct root-cause analysis, and apply corrective actions promptly. Periodic review of these KPIs can also 
inform continuous process improvement and policy refinement. 
 
Future Research. Given the promising results observed in CEAFP’s engineering projects, future research should 
explore the broader applicability of CCPM across other units within the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). This 
includes evaluating its feasibility for logistics, civil-military operations, and disaster response initiatives managed by 
the Philippine Navy, Air Force, or unified commands. Moreover, further studies could investigate the scalability of 
CCPM across different types of infrastructure projects—ranging from vertical construction to horizontal works and 
systems installations. Comparative analyses involving other project management frameworks such as Earned Value 
Management (EVM) or Lean Construction may also be conducted to identify potential synergies or complementarities.

Abstract 
 
With the rise of diverse transportation options worldwide, companies now consider various factors in mobility and 
delivery. Motorcycle taxis have become widely available and are rapidly transforming the transportation scene in the 
Philippines. Due to increasing commuter demand, tens of thousands of additional ride-hailing motorcyclists are 
needed, leading to continuous growth in this sector. Despite its expansion, a significant research gap exists. Most 
studies focus on risk factors without incorporating ""pain level"" as a measure for identifying musculoskeletal disorders 
(MSDs) among ride-hailing motorcyclists. This study addresses that gap by examining the correlation between risk 
factors and the pain levels of MSDs among ride-hailing motorcyclists in the Philippines. The primary objective is to 
determine the significant risk factors influencing MSD-related pain. The research focuses on male ride-hailing 
motorcyclists aged 21–55 in Metro Manila, utilizing surveys, interviews, and observations for data collection. Multiple 
linear regression analysis with ""pain level"" as the dependent variable is employed. Findings indicate that weight, 
alcohol consumption, motorcycle vibration, and riding duration significantly impact MSD-related pain levels. These 
factors contribute to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among ride-hailing motorcyclists. To mitigate 
risks, the study recommends careful monitoring of rider weight, reducing alcohol intake, regular motorcycle 
maintenance, and limiting travel to 7–9 hours per day to minimize fatigue. Addressing these factors can improve rider 
well-being and work efficiency, reducing the prevalence of WMSDs among motorcycle taxi drivers in the Philippines.

Abstract  
 
Underwater radiated noise (URN) from ships is an increasingly critical issue in sustainable maritime transport, with 
significant implications for vessel efficiency and decarbonization efforts. Traditional noise prediction methods, 
including empirical models like those of Ross and RANDI, are limited by their reliance on outdated datasets and 
oversimplified assumptions, while physics-based methods, although theoretically robust, demand substantial 
computational resources and often fail to generalize across diverse ship types. Recent validation studies reveal that 
even functional regression models, when applied to vessel noise datasets, account for only 25-50% of noise variability. 
This underscores the complexity of accurately capturing real-world URN patterns and highlights the need for more 
advanced, data-driven solutions to address this challenge effectively.",,,african 2025

Abstract 
 
The integration of live-streaming on the renowned social media application TikTok has caused a rapid evolution in 
the beauty and cosmetics industry, redefining e-commerce and consumer engagement and making TikTok a crucial 
platform for e-commerce and live-selling. This study investigates the influence of TikTok live-selling on impulse 
buying behavior within this industry, addressing the gap in understanding the specific factors at play. 
 This study investigated the significant factors affecting consumers’ impulse buying decisions through seven key 
factors: discounted prices, social influence, brand familiarity and reputation, emotional state, consumer’s social status 
(net income), age, and gender. Findings reveal that of all seven factors, social status and emotional state are two of 
the most significant of impulse buying in the context of TikTok live-selling. This means that the social status and 
emotional state of consumers amplify their impulsive buying tendencies within TikTok live-selling while factors like 
discounted prices, social influence, brand familiarity and reputation, age, and gender have less impact in this specific 
context. The research suggests that companies leverage emotional triggers like consumers' fear of missing out (FOMO) 
through targeted marketing as well as utilize paid advertising to showcase products in a way where consumers feel 
that the brand represents their desired lifestyle to catch the attention of consumers of higher social status. Through 
these identified factors, the study aims to provide retailers, specifically live-selling retailers, an insight into their 
consumers to help them optimize their strategies and enhance sales.

1. Introduction   
The world-renowned short video platform TikTok has evolved into an essential tool for live selling and e-commerce, 
revolutionizing the dynamics of customer interaction and business (Kaye et al. 2021). The massive growth of TikTok 
in the Philippines is particularly noteworthy, amassing 49.09 million members, or 36% of the nation's total population","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

5.4 Numerical Results (Ref- Table 1.) 
The researchers assessed model fit using several statistical metrics: Average Path Coefficient, Average R-squared, 
Adjusted R-squared, Average Block VIF, Average Full Collinearity, Tenenhaus GoF, SRMR, and SMAR. Full 
collinearity is acceptable at 5, with 3 as the ideal VIF (Kock 2015, 2017). Tenenhaus GoF is a measure of model fit, 
with thresholds of 0.1 (small), 0.25 (medium), and 0.36 (large) (Ali et al. 2016). In structural equation modeling, an 
SRMR < 0.1 indicates an acceptable fit (Beribisky and Cribbie 2024) and SMAR should also be smaller than 0.1. 
Adjusted R-squared, adjusted for number of predictors, is often preferred to R-squared. Provided that the predictors 
are statistically significant, an R-square value as low as 0.1 can be acceptable (Miles 2014). Low R-squared is a signal 
of behavioral complexity and a low R-squared may or may not be a bad model (Ozili 2023). The results revealed 
unfavorable model fit; therefore, SRMR, Average Path Coefficient, R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared ratios did not 
satisfy the postulate, pointing discrepancy between empirical and predicted merit values, and structural concerns in 
the analysis. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study examined the factors influencing consumers' impulse buying behavior in TikTok's live selling of beauty 
and cosmetic products, focusing on key variables such as net income, emotional status, social status, discounted prices, 
and brand familiarity. Structural Equation Modelling and the data gathered revealed that net income and emotional 
status significantly impact consumers' impulse buying behavior, as evidenced by their respective P-values (0.001). 
These results validate the hypothesis that a consumer's financial and emotional state is crucial to purchasing decisions 
on TikTok live selling platforms. In contrast, other factors, such as discounted prices and brand familiarity, showed 
less significance in directly affecting impulse buying behavior. 
Relating to theories such as Diffusion of Innovation, Elaboration Likelihood, and Impulse Buying, the study highlights 
how emotional and financial conditions influence consumers' purchasing behavior. The results indicate that 
individuals with higher net income or potent emotional triggers are more likely to engage in impulse buying. 
Additionally, the study employed statistical validation methods to ensure the reliability of the findings, reinforcing the 
significance of financial and emotional factors in driving consumer decisions in live-selling environments. 
The results of this study also support a number of important conclusions from prior studies about consumers’ impulse 
buying behavior. Specifically, results show that there is a significant correlation between consumer income and 
impulsive purchases which mirrors the findings of Rani & S (2023). However, in the study conducted by Rani & S 
(2023), it was found that discounts and offers have a significant impact on consumers’ impulse buying behavior, while 
our analysis indicated no statistically significant association. It is worth noting that the results from Zhang et al. (2022) 
provide supporting evidence to our findings by also finding little to no correlation between discounts and impulse 
buying behavior. The result of this study also shows that there is a significant correlation between consumers’ 
emotional state and their impulse buying behavior. This can be related to the findings of the study by Gottumukkala 
et al. (2023), which shows that impulse purchases are often driven by consumers’ feelings and momentary urges rather 
than logic. 
Based on the findings of the study, the researchers suggest that retailers should leverage emotional triggers of 
consumers as well as their desire to reflect their lifestyles. The researchers suggest that retailers prioritize a marketing 
strategy centered around the emotions of their target consumers. The fear of missing out (FOMO), jealousy on other 
consumers, and happiness are just some of the factors that retailers may use to their advantage for their marketing 
strategies. They may also use consumer and live-seller engagement to their advantage to create a bond between 
subjects to increase purchase. 
For the sellers, they can show testimonials or videos from happy customers to build trust and emotional relatability. 
Additionally, personalizing interactions with buyers by greeting viewers by name and responding to their comments 
can help make consumers feel acknowledged, boosting emotional connection. For brands, adapting pricing strategies, 
like tiered pricing models, can appeal to consumers across different income levels. 
As for social status, consumers with higher social status may feel a greater need to maintain or enhance their social 
image. With this, retailers can focus on building a brand image and aesthetic that appeals to the social status of their 
target market to create an appeal to their consumers. Retailers can utilize paid advertising and commercializing their 
products to catch the attention of these types of consumers.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

The study recommends future research to explore additional psychological and social factors, expand the sample size, 
and examine the impact of marketing strategies on impulse buying behavior. Further investigation into consumer 
decision-making processes can provide deeper insights into effective sales strategies for TikTok live selling and 
similar e-commerce platforms.

Abstract 
 
Several companies from supplier areas have issues of poor performance due to inadequate forecasting which results 
to stock-outs and over-stock conditions. The Qubes company of Saudi Arabia faces similar challegnes. The adoption 
of an improved sales forecasting mechanism can soundly help Qubes and/or other such companies maintain adequate 
stocks, minimize the likelihood of stockout situations, and in effect improve their customer satisfaction. To address 
such challenges, a forecasting and inventory management interface is designed and developed. The interface is linked 
with the demand/sale’s historical data, the forecasting techniques, and forecasting results. The main characteristics of 
the interface includes its user friendliness, easiness of data entry, graphical highlights, and the important quantitative 
indicators. The future period demand, safety stock, reorder point, and location-wise demand distributions of different 
products can be grasped through one-shot click and displayed at single screen. The presented forecasting-based 
inventory solution can improve resource utilization, reduce waste, and promote sustainable businesses. The interface 
can globally be utilized by different businesses, especially the start-ups, having their historical demand/sales data of 
one year. The interface offers results within 10% error in forecasting as compared to historical figures. Moreover, the 
inventory solution and the reliability of the interface is validated through three different cases; 1) preparing for high 
demands during seasonal peaks, 2) Supplier lead time issues with varying lead times, and 3) a case of launching a new 
product. Hence, the inventory solution and the designed interface are considered as the sustainable with global impact 
on business economy through controlling overstocking and understocking. The appropriate safety stock calculated by 
the dashboard will help achieving high customer satisfaction that leads to have a direct societal impact of the design.",,,african 2025

Abstract 
 
The aviation sector in the Philippines offers various local and commercial airlines, with mainline, regional, and charter 
airlines operating in different sectors. This study discussed the research opportunity to determine the airline 
preferences among Filipinos in association with the SERVQUAL model and Rational Choice Theory. The variables 
conceptualized in relation to Airline Preferences show the independent variables derived from the Rational Choice 
theory, namely Customer Lifestyle, Flight Comfort, and Flight (airline) Safety. Partial Least Square - Structural 
Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess the structural importance of independent variables in relation to 
dependent variables. 625 Filipinos were gathered to assess these factors, with the respondents being Filipino citizens, 
at least 18 years old, and having traveled through air transportation at least once in their lifetime. Having 622 valid 
responses out of 625, results showed that in the SERVQUAL model, Customer Satisfaction is the most significant 
factor in Filipinos’ perceived airline preference, while for the Rational Choice Theory, it was found that Customer 
Lifestyle had the strongest influence on Resource Allocation. Given these, it was recommended that airlines should 
prioritize improving their overall service quality and focus on aligning their services and marketing strategies to 
different lifestyle preferences.

6. Conclusion  
Philippine Airlines carried 11 million passengers by the end of September. This was more than the 6.4 million 
passengers in the same period last year and the 9.3 million passengers for the whole of 2022. Meanwhile, Cebu Pacific 
saw its passenger volume shoot up by 48.8 percent to 15.5 million (Piad 2023). With the gradual return of operations 
in airlines and given these increases in demand as well as the forecasted increase in revenue, airlines have incorporated 
several strategies to accommodate these. However, there is no assurance that these will become effective, given the 
fluctuation in the market. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in SmartPLS, results from 622 respondents 
revealed that Customer Satisfaction (ß = 0.718, p = 0.000) is the strongest determinant of airline preference, suggesting 
that Filipino airline passengers are more likely to choose an airline that guarantees safety and transparency. Assurance 
(ß = 0.276, p = 0.000) primarily drives satisfaction, indicating that courteous service influences Filipino travelers. 
Under Rational Choice Theory, Resource Allocation (ß = 0.160, p = 0.000) is the strongest factor in airline preference, 
mainly driven by Customer Lifestyle (ß = 0.472, p = 0.000). Insignificant relationships were found between Flight 
Comfort and Resource Allocation (p = 0.227) and Societal Norms and Airline Preference (p = 0.343). 
 
This study provides further discussion and data specific to the Philippines since most available literature on this topic 
is outdated, requires updates in data and literature, and is mainly global in scope. The integration of the Rational 
Choice Theory and SERVQUAL presents a unique perspective on how individuals go about their approach regarding 
airline preference. The study emphasizes service quality using the SERVQUAL Model, highlighting Filipinos' 
preference for airlines prioritizing safety, transparency, and customer service. Philippine Airlines' drop in Skytrax 
rankings signals the need for improvements, while competitors like Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways excel 
through service excellence and strategic partnerships. Under the Rational Choice Theory, Filipino passengers value 
loyalty programs and sustainability-driven services. The liberalization of the Philippine air transport industry 
improved competition, reduced fares, and enhanced service, with technological advancements playing a key role. 
Philippine Airlines' mobile app demonstrates the impact of digital transformation on engagement and sales. It is 
recommended that airlines integrate digital solutions further to enhance customer experience and operational 
efficiency. Customer satisfaction, driven by assurance, is the strongest factor influencing airline preference. Airlines 
should enhance interactive safety briefings and cultural training while offering personalized services and lifestyle-
based packages. Marketing should emphasize functional benefits rather than prioritizing societal norm factors. Future 
studies are recommended to explore demographic-specific insights, emotional influences, and qualitative perspectives. 
These strategies can strengthen airline competitiveness and align services with evolving passenger expectations for 
long-term industry success.

Abstract 
 
Street sweepers are known to experience high levels of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to the physically 
demanding nature of their work. This study aimed to identify the risk factors affecting work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders (WMSDs) among street sweepers in Quezon City, Philippines. The researchers investigated various 
demographic (age, gender, occupational seniority), individual-related (BMI, drinking habits, smoking habits), work-
related (work duration, work posture, work tools), and environmental (heat exposure, noise exposure) factors. A total 
of 130 participants were included in the study, exceeding the required sample size of 123. Quantitative research 
methods were utilized, with data collected using the MSD Severity and Frequency Questionnaire (MSFQ) and a 
researcher-administered questionnaire. The Ovako Working Posture Assessment System (OWAS) was employed to 
assess working postures, while a weighing scale and measuring tape were used to record participants’ weight and 
height. Multiple Linear Regression was performed to examine the relationship between the prevalence of WMSDs 
and the identified risk factors. The results revealed that four factors—work duration, work tools, drinking habits, and 
smoking habits—were significantly associated with the prevalence of WMSDs. These findings highlight the 
importance of addressing these significant risk factors to improve the quality of life of street sweepers.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025

Table 7 summarizes the hypothesis testing results on factors influencing WMSDs among street sweepers. Drinking 
habits, smoking habits, work duration, and work tools showed significant associations, while age, gender, BMI, work 
posture, heat exposure, and noise exposure were not statistically significant. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study successfully identified the risk factors affecting work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among 
street sweepers in Quezon City, fulfilling its primary objective. By analyzing various demographic, individual-related, 
work-related, and environmental factors, the research determined that work duration, work tools, drinking habits, and 
smoking significantly contribute to the prevalence of WMSDs. The findings highlighted that increased alcohol 
consumption, smoking frequency, prolonged work duration, and dissatisfaction with work tools lead to higher levels 
of musculoskeletal discomfort. Conversely, factors such as age, gender, BMI, work posture, heat exposure, and noise 
exposure showed no significant relationship with WMSDs, suggesting that their variations do not directly impact the 
condition. 
 
A key contribution of this study is its empirical evidence on an overlooked labor sector, reinforcing the urgent need 
for ergonomic interventions and policy improvements tailored to street sweepers' working conditions. The cost-benefit 
analysis further demonstrated that with minimal financial investment and behavioral changes, the health and well-
being of street sweepers can significantly improve. These insights provide a strong foundation for future research and 
policymaking aimed at reducing occupational health risks and enhancing the overall quality of life for workers in 
physically demanding environments.

Abstract  
 
The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Industry is the most significant contributor to the economy of the Philippines 
as it is a significant outsourcing location due to the high skill level of its workforce, with 1.3 million Filipino BPO 
employees recorded in 2019 (Rostron, 2024). Nowadays, BPO industries have noticed that traditional working 
methods are impractical. One major issue of the hybrid setup is the vagueness of company regulations as employees 
indicated concerns regarding dissatisfaction and setbacks. According to Gumasing et al., 2023, occasional call 
connections caused social isolation, general anxiety, more work hours, reduced productivity, and job satisfaction. This 
study assessed the significant factors affecting the mental workload of inbound voice contact center agents in the 
Philippines in a hybrid work setup and provided insightful recommendations for managing their mental workload. 
The primary basis is a custom-made survey questionnaire on their experience working in a hybrid setup as inbound 
voice contact center agents, and data analysis is done using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-
SEM) in WarpPLS software. The results revealed that customer type (p = 0.051), emotional dissonance (p = 0.001), 
psychological factors (p = 0.007), depersonalization (p = 0.022), work design at home (p = 0.001), and non-work 
stressors (p = 0.057) significantly impact mental workload. These findings highlight the complex interaction between 
personal, organizational, and external factors affecting the contact agents’ mental workload. The researchers 
recommended that organizations conduct a mental health examination routine, offer emotional wellness programs, 
and ensure an ergonomic work environment to mitigate the mental workload of the employees.

1. Introduction  
According to Talmage-Rostron (2024), the Philippines has become a major global outsourcing hub due to its skilled 
workforce, contributing $30 billion annually to the economy and holding 10-15% of the global BPO market. The rise 
of remote work, accelerated by the pandemic, has significantly reshaped the industry, with hybrid and work-from-
home setups becoming more prevalent despite challenges like low productivity, data security concerns, and poor",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Abstract  
 
In recent years, practitioners and researchers have paid great attention to increase the efficiency of supply chain 
management due to global economic changes. One of the most important issue of any supply chain is warehouses and 
therefore, managing warehouse operations in an effective way has become very significant for both manufacturers 
and e-commerce companies. Previous studies about warehouse operations showed that one of the most costly and 
labor incentive process in warehouse is order picking operations. Because of this, increasing order picking efficiency 
has huge impact on total warehouse management efficiency. Researchers have focused on different aspect (problem 
scope) like order batching, routing, storage assignment etc. of warehouse management operations and developed 
divergent solution approaches like exact solution methods, simulations and/or heuristic/metaheuristic algorithms to 
handle these problems. In this study, it is aimed to analyze the effect of constructing multiple depots while solving 
order batching and assignment problem under order splitting strategy. For this purpose, mathematical model is 
developed and two different randomly generated order groups which contain 20 and 25 customer orders are used to 
conduct analyses. For each group, 20 separate experiments are performed from two divergent perspectives, single and 
multiple depots. Results of the experiments showed that constructing multiple depots can decrease total order picking 
distances. There is also the potential for the positive impact of constructing multiple depots to increase when the 
number of customer orders handled increases.

Finally, paired t-tests are applied to assess the statistical significance of the results obtained. The main purpose of 
conducting paired t-test is to test whether the means of two paired measurements are significantly different. If the 
obtained p-value at the end of the test is smaller than the significance level (alpha is equal to 0,01 or 0,05), it can be 
said that the results are statistically significant. The results of the paired t-test conducted using Excel are shown in 
Table 2 and Table 3 for 20 and 25 customer orders, respectively. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the 
obtained result with proposed mathematical model is statistically significant. In other words, the positive impact of 
constructing multiple depots on reducing total order picking distance is not due to the randomness of customer orders.

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
In this study, the effect of constructing multiple depots instead of single left-most located depot is analyzed while 
solving order batching and assignment problem under order splitting strategy. A mathematical model is developed to 
solve mentioned problem. Two different order groups which contain 20 and 25 randomly generated customer orders 
are used and for each group 20 different experiments are conducted. The results of the experiments showed that if 
order splitting strategy is followed to solve order batching and assignment problem, constructing multiple depots will 
be beneficial to decrease total order picking distances.  
 
As future researches, a new heuristic algorithm can be developed to solve this problem for large-size problem. In 
addition to this, the effect of applied storage strategy can be analyzed with the above mentioned problem scope. 
Especially, mixed-storage strategy can be integrated to mathematical model and results can be analyzed.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
 
This paper investigates the possibility of adopting banana pseudostem (BPS) fibers as a sustainable medium-density 
fiberboard (MDF) reinforcement for the Philippine construction industry. The purposes were to evaluate and compare 
the mechanical properties of BPS fiber-reinforced MDF, BPSF MDF, to conventional MDF, or CMDF, in terms of 
internal bond (IB), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and modulus of rupture (MOR). To achieve this, quasi-experimental 
research design was used for testing the five fiber ratios. Results indicated that the optimal mixture of 50% BPSF and 
50% wood fibers proved to possess better mechanical properties than the other mixtures and conventional MDF. 
Although the production cost of the Mixture 3: 50/50 mixture was a bit higher, enhanced durability and flexural 
strength values suggest its feasibility for applications in construction projects. The research thus recommends using 
the Mixture 3: 50/50 BPSF-WF mixture for producing MDF in the future due to environmental sustainability 
combined with better mechanical performance. Further research is also suggested to be conducted on long-term 
performance in order to be perfected in the method of production, which will enable the high utilization of this 
sustainable material.

Abstract 
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as robots, computer vision, natural language processing, machine 
learning, and more, have the potential to completely transform education by offering automated grading, intelligent 
mentoring, individualized learning, and more. Despite its benefits, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
Philippine education is challenged with significant obstacles such as cultural taboos, limits in digital infrastructure, 
and expensive internet expenses.  The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT 2) was utilized 
in this study to determine the factors that have significant effects on generation Z's perceived behavioral intention to 
use text generative artificial intelligence in the Philippines. Ethical consideration was also added to assess how they 
affect perceived risk and attitude on how they perceive their behavioral intention. Multiple regression was done for 
the data analysis with the use of Minitab. It was determined that the factors Effort Expectancy (EE), Performance 
Expectancy (PE), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Habit (HB), Ethical Considerations (EC), 
Perceived Risk (PR), Attitude (ATT), Region, and Gender all significantly affect how Generation Z utilizes text-
generative artificial intelligence. These findings serve as a better understanding of how these factors influence the PBI 
of students in utilizing text generative artificial intelligence.

1. Introduction 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and act like 
humans (Dong et al. 2020). This study differs from existing literature in that it looks specifically at the behavioral 
intentions of Filipino Gen Z students with the use of text-generative AI in education. The literature focused on a 
general analysis of AI adoption, this article examines explicitly a quantitative approach using multiple regression","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Figure 4 depicts the residual plots that help analyze the normality, homoscedasticity, independence, and model fit of 
Generation Z’s Perceived Behavioral Intention to assess the regression model’s validity and assumptions. The 
normality probability plot was used to test for normality, which shows that the residuals follow a normal distribution 
as the points lie along the red line. However, the tails show minor deviations, indicating mild skewness. In testing, the 
homoscedasticity versus fits model is used where it can be seen that the points are randomly scattered with no 
systematic pattern, indicating constant variance with the residuals. The histogram depicts the distribution of the 
residuals as symmetric and bell-shaped, the normality of the assumption, and the fact that there is no bias in the 
prediction. Lastly, the model fit is assessed through the versus order that identifies the autocorrelation. In this graph, 
the points are randomly scattered with no identifiable trends. It also shows that the residuals are independent over time 
through arbitrary upward and downward movements.  
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The Philippines is a developing country still in the initial phase of adapting to different artificial intelligence tools in 
different industries (Chitturu et al., 2017). That being said, the usage of it poses freedom for everyone who uses it with 
no limitations in place regarding its proper usage. No laws or regulations center on using artificial intelligence, leaving 
a gap in ethical considerations, liability, privacy risks, etc.  
 
Through the results of this study, academic institutions can guide students through the development of school policies 
or guidelines on the effective utilization of text-generative artificial intelligence in education. These policies can center 
around plagiarism, prohibition of uploading official school materials for summarization purposes, utilizing them 
cautiously, and verifying all information gathered. In addition, this can also help schools create new curriculums that 
can help students utilize artificial intelligence in their respective fields of study. This new curriculum may explore 
ethics courses on proper usage of artificial intelligence, incorporation of grammatical and plagiarism checkers as part 
of education tools, and how artificial intelligence is used in the workplace. 
 
The application of this study could also benefit educators to understand further how students utilize artificial 
intelligence and why they utilize them, using this to their advantage in guiding their students how they can properly 
utilize the power of artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks. This will allow students to not only use artificial 
intelligence to cheat but to expand more their skills and use them to aid in their studies in the right way. In relation to 
integrating ethics courses in the curriculum, educators may use this study to leverage the level of understanding the 
generation has with regards to artificial intelligence and adjust their materials to further cover what the learners need. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study on Generation Z's utilization of text-generative artificial intelligence reveals significant insights into their 
behavioral intentions. The findings through the regression model were able to reveal that the factors Effort Expectancy 
(EE), Performance Expectancy (PE), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Habit (HB), Ethical 
Considerations (EC), Perceived Risk (PR), Attitude (ATT), Region, and Gender all significantly affect how 
Generation Z utilizes text-generative artificial intelligence. This highlights Generation Z’s uniqueness towards 
curiosity, exploration, and risk-taking as the key characteristics that shape how they perceive life and embrace 
technology. Curiosity is a way in which they seek new experiences and explore a different perspective in what they 
do. Their risk-taking drives them to seek fulfillment and engage in new activities regardless of the consequences as 
long as the technology satisfies them (Salleh et al. 2017; Lopez and Abadiano 2023).  
 
Their region or area is a significant factor in Generation Z's behavioral intention to utilize text-generative artificial 
intelligence. This is true for the Philippines as one of the inequalities still prevalent in the nation lies in digital access, 
where those coming from rural areas have slow to no internet access, which affects how they utilize artificial 
intelligence as this requires internet access (Alibudbud 2024). Gender also affects the intention to use artificial 
intelligence as the different perceptions of artificial intelligence affect how each gender utilizes this tool, where males 
have a more positive view of the applications of artificial intelligence and trust it more than females (Armutat et al. 
2024).   
 
Overall, this study identified the key factors that affect Generation Z's utilization of text-generative artificial 
intelligence in terms of their behavioral intention. This will give a better understanding of the current behavior and 
preferences of the generation that will help identify the right approach to addressing the growth of artificial intelligence 
in the Philippines.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

For future studies, researchers can expand the nature of the study of analyzing the behavioral intention when utilizing 
other types of artificial intelligence or artificial intelligence as a whole. It can also expand to other generations as half 
of the population of generation z would be young professionals already in the next few years. Lastly, since this study 
is more centered towards the National Capital Region and Luzon, other studies can further delve into the situation in 
other regions in the Philippines considering vast cultural diversity of the country, educational gaps, and difference in 
accessibility in different materials and technology are prominent and creates a divide.

Abstract 
 
The Philippines is a leading destination for BPO services because of its cost advantages and skilled workforce. 
However, front-office BPO employees often encounter challenges associated with shift work, as they have to modify 
their working hours to meet the demands of foreign clients. These challenges include cognitive strain, burnout, and 
disengagement, to mention a few. A growing concern in the industry is quiet quitting, where employees do not 
formally resign but perform their work at a bare minimum. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring the experiences 
of front-office BPO employees across all shifts and generational cohorts, focusing on how varying work schedules 
affect job demands, resources, and quiet quitting behavior. Using the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, the study 
explores the relationship between burnout, workload, work-family conflict, engagement, feedback, and social support 
influence quiet quitting. Data was collected from 299 respondents and analyzed using Partial Least Squares - Structural 
Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings indicate that higher engagement significantly reduces quiet quitting 
tendencies. Additionally, feedback and social support mitigate disengagement indirectly by means of improving 
employee satisfaction, commitment, and work-life balance. The research provides valuable findings for BPO sectors, 
company leaders, policymakers, and employees - emphasizing the importance of improving workplace conditions to 
enhance productivity and retention. Future research can build upon these findings to explore further the challenges 
within the BPO industry and inform policies that promote employee well-being.

Abstract 
 
The prevalence and increasing demand for security personnel in the Philippines stem from their historical role in 
safeguarding premises, the economic disparities that heighten the need for private security, and the rising crime rates 
that challenge public safety resources, which all contribute to the profession's demanding working conditions that 
severely influences their well-being, resulting in lapses in ensuring safety. This study aims to identify statistically 
significant variables affecting the Perceived Safety Culture (PSC) mindset and behavior of security personnel tasked 
with protecting assets and properties in the Philippines and examines Job Security, Safety Motivation, and Risk 
Perception as root factors while integrating Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Expectation Confirmation 
Theory (ECT) and the variables under both theories, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-
SEM). The data was gathered through online and onsite surveys utilizing convenience sampling, garnering 615 valid 
respondents, composed of licensed security personnel from various security agencies in the Philippines. Results 
revealed that all hypothesized variable relationships were significant, except for Job Security, which has an 
insignificant relationship with Perceived Vulnerability. The relationship between Perceived Safety Culture and 
Satisfaction has the highest beta coefficient (ß= 0.720, p= 0.000), making it the strongest relationship in the model. It 
suggests that Satisfaction further reinforces the Perceived Safety Culture, enabling security personnel to perform 
safety-related behaviors more effectively. These findings can help organizations refine their policies and training 
programs by prioritizing the three root factors identified in the model, as it eventually strengthens the safety culture 
among security personnel.

Abstract 
 
In the highly competitive manufacturing industry, optimizing production processes is essential for improving 
efficiency, reducing bottlenecks, and minimizing production delays. This study employs JaamSim (Simulutaion 
tool) to perform Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) in order to analyze the production workflow at Geo Sondaj 
Makine AŞ., a drilling equipment manufacturer. The study thoughtfully explores seven key components, aiming 
to identify potential bottlenecks using queue metrics and machine activity data. Different strategies, such as 
increasing workstation capacities, implementing parallel multiple working stations, and dynamic resource 
allocation, were tested to improve throughput and reduce production time. Simulation experiments showed 
significant performance benefits, especially a 37.9% reduction in the production time of the HQ Core Barrel 
component, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed improvements. Statistical analysis (confidence 
intervals: 90%, 95%, 99%) and graphical comparisons were performed to validate these improvements, which 
confirmed the reliable effectiveness of the implemented strategies. The results prove that DES is an effective tool 
not only for identifying bottlenecks but also for production optimization and decision-making in manufacturing. 
Future research should explore predictive models based on artificial intelligence to further improve performance 
and resource utilization.

1. Introduction 
Robust and innovative strategies are needed to effectively manage the increasing complexity of modern 
manufacturing systems and improve production efficiency. A key challenge is the bottleneck phenomenon, where 
the production flow is interrupted at certain stages, causing delays and production losses. According to 
Ingemansson et al. (2005), automated simulation models are a reliable way to solve this problem, which helps in 
the timely identification and remediation of bottlenecks. These models provide the opportunity to digitize 
manufacturing systems and analyze performance in a virtual environment, without any practical intervention. This 
approach enables the identification of production defects, the effective allocation of resources, and the 
improvement of overall production efficiency, which makes the performance of the manufacturing system more 
stable and efficient. 
 
To conduct a detailed examination of how various components interact over time, especially within the 
manufacturing and service environments, many organizations employ discrete-event simulation (DES). DES helps 
identify hidden inefficiencies in complex systems that traditional analysis might overlook (Ingemansson et al.,","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
ManagementRabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025

Figure 7. Scenario 1 vs Scenario 4 – All Components (Side by Side) 
 
5.4 Proposed Improvements 
A number of improvement proposals are put forth to mitigate the identified bottlenecks and improve the overall 
performance of the system. Increasing capacity at bottleneck stages—especially lathe and milling for components 
like HQ Core Barrel and Overshot—is strongly recommended. Parallel workstations will be implemented for 
turning and millin g processes to ensure continuous workflow and reduce process delays. Furthermore, dynamic 
resource allocation strategies based on real-time queue lengths and utilization rates need to be adopted to reduce 
waiting times and ensure efficient resource utilization. These improvements also include increasing assembly 
stations for components where assembly has been identified as a bottleneck, such as component 535 Pump. In 
addition, the production process can be further improved by continuously monitoring workstation utilization and 
incorporating automation tools to prevent bottlenecks. The implementation of these proposals is expected to 
significantly reduce waiting times, queue lengths, and overall production time, enabling significant improvements 
in the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing system. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study thoroughly examines the importance and utility of using DES for analyzing and enhancing production 
processes in a manufacturing environment. The primary objective of this study was to identify bottlenecks in 
production and implement targeted optimization strategies to effectively address them, resulting in significant 
improvements in throughput and overall performance.Based on the simulation outputs, it was observed that 
increasing workstation capacity, adding parallel stations, and using dynamic resource allocation effectively 
reduced bottlenecks. These measures not only helped to improve the production flow but also led to an increase 
in the fluidity and efficiency of the manufacturing process. The validation results also confirmed that the 
improvement in the manufacturing process are limited without data-driven strategies and advanced technological 
interventions. The research findings provide a clear direction for manufacturing industries to take advantage of 
advanced simulation techniques to increase productivity and improve operational efficiency.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

While the results are promising, the model does not account for unexpected human errors, supply chain 
disruptions, or maintenance delays. In future studies, it would be valuable to explore hybrid simulation models 
and how they can be integrated with real-time data from IoT systems to support quicker and more accurate 
decisions on the shop floor.  
 
Further research could also investigate the application of advanced AI methods—such as predictive bottleneck 
detection, using supervised learning techniques like decision trees or artificial neural networks. These models can 
be trained on historical machine logs and production data to forecast emerging bottlenecks in real time. In addition, 
reinforcement learning could be applied to develop dynamic scheduling policies that continuously adapt based on 
current system states, improving responsiveness and efficiency. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that 
simulation-based strategies are not only theoretical tools but also highly actionable solutions that can deliver 
measurable results and support informed, data-driven production decisions.

Abstract  
 
Shipping plays a vital role in global trade, facilitating over 90% of international trade by volume. However, it also 
contributes to significant environmental pollution, accounting for around 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and substantial amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM), black 
carbon (BC), and methane (CH4). These pollutants negatively impact both the climate and public health, particularly 
in coastal areas.In response, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set ambitious targets for reducing 
shipping emissions, with the goal of achieving near-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Interim goals include a 20% 
reduction by 2030 and 70-80% by 2040. As part of these efforts, the IMO introduced regulations such as the Energy 
Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) to monitor energy efficiency and 
emissions.To support these regulatory efforts, we propose a machine learning framework to predict GHG emissions 
from vessels navigating the Saint Lawrence River. By utilizing AIS data, vessel-specific details, and meteorological 
data, our approach will create a detailed emissions inventory. Using deep learning models, the system will predict",,,african 2025

Abstract 
 
According to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (2024) in 2023, the mining sub sector represented 10.4% of Peru's 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while in 2024 exports of key metals (silver, copper, lead, zinc) reached US$ 3,104 
million. In January 2024, mining investment amounted to US$ 441,703,467, 61.9% higher than the figure recorded in 
the same month of the previous year. These indicators confirm that mining is essential for the Peruvian economy, 
representing one of the main sources of income and generating direct and indirect employment. As a world leader in 
the production of copper, gold and silver, Peru occupies a strategic role in international markets. However, the long 
times in granting authorization titles for mining projects affect the competitiveness of the sector and the attraction of 
investments. This research addresses this problem by applying Lean Six Sigma tools to optimize administrative 
processes, reduce operating costs and accelerate project execution. Improving efficiency in the Mining Concessions 
Department will strengthen Peru's position as an attractive destination for mining investment, especially in a context 
of growing global demand for minerals. Therefore, the results of this study contribute to the sustainability and 
competitiveness of a crucial sector for the national economy.

1. Introduction 
The development of mining in Peru is essential to the economy. According to the Mining Statistical Bulletin (2024), 
between 2015 and 2024, the sector contributed more than S/55,855 million in royalties, fees, and expiry fees. 
According to García (2023), approximately 60% to 63.9% of Peruvian exports come from mining, which is a key 
source of foreign currency that facilitates the import of goods and technologies for the country's development. This 
activity positions Peru as a world leader in the production of minerals such as copper, gold, and silver, essential for 
international markets. However, the process of granting mining permits faces serious inefficiencies, with deadlines 
that can exceed a year.",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

The faster approval of mining concessions due to process improvements could increase foreign investment, attracting 
between $2 billion to $5 billion, depending on the project’s scale. With mining representing nearly 10% of the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP), this increase could boost the economy by 0.5% to 1% annually, with projected profits of up 
to $1.5 billion. Additionally, the creation of 3,000 to 5,000 jobs (direct and indirect) could generate higher salaries, 
benefiting the national economy. 
 
5. Discussion 
The implementation of process improvement proposals to reduce the approval times of mining titles not only optimizes 
operational efficiency but also significantly improves response times for applicants. This advancement contributes to 
a more positive perception from users, promoting a more efficient and responsible management environment. 
Firstly, a 32% reduction was achieved in the number of requests that had to be reprocessed due to incorrect data entry. 
This result was achieved through the development and implementation of an application with restrictions that prevent 
the input of erroneous or incomplete information. This improvement has been crucial as it has allowed the process to 
be streamlined, enabling requests to quickly enter the workflow and receive prompt responses. We identified that 
requests rejected due to this type of incident not only caused delays but also negatively impacted the economy of 
mining companies. The economic impact depends on several factors, such as the size of the mine (small, medium, or 
large), the type of investment, and the duration of the projects. 
Additionally, the objective was to increase the productivity of the staff responsible for the management and issuance 
of mining concessions. During the pilot phase, the productivity of the staff increased from 0.0481 to 0.051, 
demonstrating the positive impact of specialized training programs. This result highlights the importance of having a 
better-trained team, as their efficiency in performing their tasks allows mining permits to be properly evaluated and 
quick responses to be provided to applicants. Aside from the economic impact of streamlining this process, it is also 
important to highlight other key aspects mentioned in the article, such as the generation of employment benefiting 
thousands of citizens (Ministry of Energy and Mines, 2021). 
Finally, the projected increase in the compliance rate of issued mining titles was 14%, but the results of the pilot phase 
reached 19.66%, coming very close to the established goal. This result demonstrates that the instruction manuals for 
technical analysis and mining registry were essential tools in optimizing processes, contributing to improved 
efficiency in the issuance of permits (González, 2022).

Abstract 
Various energy-intensive water treatment areas depend on centrifugal pumps for their water treatment. A centrifugal 
pump is estimated to be responsible for 90 percent of the water treatment process energy consumption. Automated 
control scenarios with schedule standby and duty cycles can optimize and reduce energy consumption and increase 
pump reliability. Using duty and standby pump control scenarios, for example, will increase the system's sustainability, 
serviceability, and reliability. Additionally, an innovative controller with variable frequency drives can further reduce 
pump operating costs and save energy which is one of the objectives of current project. 
 
A literature survey and a search for a local VFD supplier are the first phases of the graduation project. A computer 
simulation methodology is used to test the schedule control scenario on the panel assembly table as a proof of concept. 
In order to construct the controller panel prototype, hardware is either purchased locally or imported from outside the 
country. 
 
As part of the final phase of the project, the controller will be tested on an industrial field using a booster pump set. A 
portion of the work will be performed in the industrial engineering laboratory, while the remainder will be performed 
in collaboration with the booster pump dealer. As a final approval concept, the in-field controller panel has been tested 
and approved for the booster pump application of two centrifugal pumps. The project results have impact of the energy 
sustainability, serviceability and system reliability. 
 
In conclusion, the teamwork recommends continuing the development of the controller scenario for the application of 
multiple pump units with HMI and incorporating IoT functionality into the controller panel development.",,,african 2025

Abstract  
 
Industrial accidents involving cutting machines are a significant issue, with hand injuries being the second most 
common type of accident. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 1 million workers require emergency 
treatment annually, with 110,000 cases leading to lost work time. One of the primary reasons for these incidents is the 
lack of adequate training and access control, resulting in unauthorized or improper machine usage. This study presents 
the development of an intelligent safety system designed to mitigate these risks through biometric authentication via 
fingerprint validation. The system ensures that only authorized and trained personnel can operate industrial cutting 
machines. Additionally, it records essential data such as user identity, usage duration, and access times, enabling 
enhanced monitoring and operational efficiency. The proposed prototype integrates seamlessly with existing 
monitoring systems, offering a user-friendly interface that enhances accessibility and reliability. The research 
methodology involved defining market requirements, designing a functional model using a prototyping approach, and 
implementing biometric technologies with microcontrollers like Arduino. Testing was conducted in a controlled 
environment to validate the system’s functionality, assess its reliability, and optimize its performance. The results 
indicate a significant reduction in unauthorized machine access, improved safety measures, and enhanced compliance 
with industrial regulations. This study highlights the potential of biometric authentication systems in industrial safety, 
providing a scalable and innovative solution for workplace risk management.

1. Introduction 
The increasing incidence of workplace accidents, where hand injuries represent the second most common type, 
highlights the need for more effective safety systems in the management of industrial machinery. According to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1 million workers are treated in emergency rooms annually due to workplace 
accidents, with approximately 110,000 cases leading to lost work time (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023). One of the 
main causes of these incidents is the lack of proper training and control over machine use, generating significant risks 
for both operators and companies (Alshbtat, Zanoon, & Alfraheed 2019).Recent studies have emphasized the role of 
biometric security in mitigating workplace hazards by restricting machine access to trained personnel. 
Implementations of fingerprint recognition and IoT-based monitoring systems have demonstrated their effectiveness 
in improving industrial safety standards (Sarhan 2020). Additionally, integrating machine safety solutions with cloud-
based analytics provides real-time alerts and automated compliance tracking, reducing human error and unauthorized 
access ( Kadhim & MohammedAmeen 2020).","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

space but also being able to save specific information such as time of use, period of use for specific reports that are 
relevant to the user. 
Another improvement is the management of wiring will help save space by reducing material costs in the production 
of the equipment's protective box. 
The project benefits from an extensive command of C++ and libraries from the fact that shorter, more efficient scripts 
mean faster processing of this information. 
 
5.4 Validation  
For the validation of this project, 20 users have been created, each of them being able to use the system successfully. 
These tests were carried out on servo motors and LED lights to check that the lock or access to the electrical source 
works correctly for posterior use in an industrial cutting machine. These accesses receive an input of information from 
the RTC module, then that information and the fingerprint record represented by a number are stored on a mini SD 
card connected to an SD module. This information is exported in a .txt format which provides a record of the users' 
hours of use and hours of work. Due to the capacity of the 8GB card, it provides more than enough capacity for 
recording information. 
 
 
 
Figure 7. Record in txt format 
 
A pilot testing phase was carried out in a real industrial environment to evaluate the effectiveness of the system. 
Metrics were implemented to measure the reduction in accident incidence, access control efficiency, and staff 
satisfaction.The results of the pilot phase were analyzed to verify if the system met the established objectives. 
Accident reduction data was collected and feedback surveys were conducted with users to assess system acceptance 
and performance.Based on the results obtained, adjustments were made to the system to improve its performance 
and adaptability. Recommendations were developed for large-scale implementation and for the integration of 
additional features based on the specific needs of different industrial environments. 
 
6. Conclusion 
According to the realization of the prototype, it is concluded that it is possible to develop a security system through 
the Arduino controller that, through correct programming, obtains the expected functionality, with efficiency and 
effectiveness in its execution as well as versatility and comfort when using it. The conclusion has been reached, thanks 
to our own research in scientific articles, of the existence of devices involved in the field of security that use the 
Arduino for their development. In conclusion, it has been verified that both codes and components whose presence 
has been necessary in this model have been developed based on the criteria that were maintained as objectives within 
this work. It is also concluded that linking the presented prototype with other applications is possible with some 
component variations in the assembly of the prototype. 31 Finally, it is concluded that based on a rejected or authorized 
recognition, the user will receive a direct message depending on the type of recognition that the prototype presents.

Abstract 
 
The foundry under study is a critical revenue-generating asset for one of the operating divisions of South Africa’s 
largest railway company. However, its operational efficiency has deteriorated over time, leading to significant profit 
losses. The sustained decline in performance has resulted in a shortage of essential railway rolling stock components, 
posing risks to business continuity and potential job losses.This study aims to identify key constraints limiting the 
foundry’s utilization relative to its installed capacity and to recommend targeted interventions to enhance efficiency, 
profitability, and competitiveness. A mixed-methods research approach, integrating both quantitative and qualitative 
analyses, was employed to assess operational bottlenecks. Findings indicate that external controls, internal controls, 
and support services are primary constraints, adversely impacting turnaround times and escalating operating costs. 
The study’s insights contribute to existing research frameworks for diagnosing operational inefficiencies in 
manufacturing environments, particularly within state-owned enterprises. The validation of the theoretical model used 
in this research demonstrates its applicability and reliability in identifying and addressing production constraints in 
similar industrial settings.

1. Introduction 
In the contemporary business landscape, foundries play an important role in manufacturing high-quality metal 
components for a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, rail and construction.  Over the years, 
extensive research has studied many aspects of foundry operations, from process optimization and resource allocation 
to technological adoption and environmental compliance.  Studies by researchers such as McKie (2015) and Nyemba 
et al (2017) highlight key challenges like equipment downtime, process inefficiencies, and resource underutilization 
as noteworthy barriers to optimal productivity.  For instance, Nyakala et al. (2023) explored the constraints that limit 
productivity.  Similarly, Phiri et al. (2024) focused on the impact of several macroeconomic factors on both foundry 
production efficiency and the ability to expand into new markets.  These studies have provided valuable insights into 
isolated constraints affecting foundry performance.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

However, from the Interrelationship results, the Clients variable was found to be an effect, and therefore, it is not the 
constraint on the utilisation and competitiveness of the foundry. 
 
H2: The suppliers influence the utilisation and competitiveness of Foundry X.  
From the Correlation Analysis results, there are strong relationships between Suppliers variable and Product Offering, 
Production Processes and Decision-making, and Technologies variables. Therefore, this hypothesis is valid. However, 
from the interrelationship results, the Suppliers variable was found to be the effect and therefore, it is not the constraint 
on the utilisation and competitiveness of the foundry. 
 
H3: The diversification of product offering influences utilisation and competitiveness of Foundry X. 
From the Correlation Analysis results, there are strong relationships between Product offering variable and Production 
processes and decision-making, and Technologies variables. Therefore, this hypothesis is valid. However, from 
interrelationship results, the Product offering variable was found to be the effect and therefore, it is not a constraint 
on the utilisation and competitiveness of the foundry. 
 
H4: The production processes and decision-making affect the utilisation and competitiveness of Foundry X. 
From the Correlation Analysis results, there are strong relationships between the Production processes and decision-
making variables and Product offering and Technologies variables. Therefore, this hypothesis is valid. However, from 
the interrelationship results, the Production processes and decision-making variable were found to be the effect. 
Therefore, it is not a constraint on the utilisation and competitiveness of the foundry. 
 
H5: The management of manufacturing technologies affects the utilisation and competitiveness of Foundry X. 
From the Correlation Analysis results, there are strong relationships between the Technologies variable and Production 
processes and decision-making, and Product offering variables. Therefore, this hypothesis is valid. However, from the 
interrelationship results, the Technologies variable was found to be the effect in this study and therefore, it is not the 
constraint on the utilisation and competitiveness of the foundry. 
 
H6: The internal and external controls affect the utilisation and competitiveness of Foundry X. 
From the Correlation Analysis results, there are strong relationships between the External controls and Production 
processes and decision-making, Product offering and Technologies variables. Also, the Internal controls variable has 
moderate to strong relationships with these variables. Therefore, this hypothesis is valid. From the interrelationship 
table, both External and Internal controls variables were found to be causes. Therefore, this means that these variables 
are the constraints on the utilisation and competitiveness of the foundry, with the External control variable being the 
main constraint. 
 
H7: The support services affect the utilisation and competitiveness of Foundry X.  
From the Correlation Analysis results, there are moderate to strong relationships between the Support services variable 
and Production processes and decision-making, Product offering and Technologies variables. Therefore, this 
hypothesis is valid. From the interrelationship results, the Support services variable was found to be the constraint on 
the utilisation and competitiveness of the foundry. It follows the Internal controls variable. 
 
7. Conclusion and Recommendations  
The variables External controls, Internal controls, and Support services were identified as constraints that limit the 
utilisation of Foundry X to its installed capacity.  The External controls variable was identified as the main constraint 
in terms of operating costs and speed, followed respectively by the Internal controls and Support services variables 
both in terms of operational speed.  This suggests that the identified constraints collectively impact the competitiveness 
of the foundry negatively in terms of speed and cost.  According to respondents, this is mainly due to: 
 
• Long procurement processes that must be followed when acquiring goods and services, 
• Challenges of not being able to directly do business with OEMs on many occasions as most of them do not meet 
some of the requirements stipulated in the – Public Finance Management Act South African government (PFMA) 
• Absence of investment in recruiting the workforce required to meet the demands, and 
• Lack of investment in advanced technologies that can improve production costs and efficiencies in Foundry X. 
So, in addressing these constraints using the TOC approach, the resources should be focused on elevating the External 
controls constraint, specifically on adopting policies that will improve operating speed and costs in the foundry.  Upon","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

elevating the External controls constraint, the focus should then be on the Internal controls followed by the Support 
services, if the constraints do not move as they tend to do.  The performance of the interventions made should be 
measured using the TOC measurement parameters, thus, throughput, inventory and operating expenses.Future 
research should be broadened to get diverse inputs or views from government employees, especially PFMA policy 
champions; and former suppliers, external clients and employees who were involved in the operations of the foundry.  
This will help to improve accuracy of results and participation rate as well.

Abstract  
 
This project focuses on the development of a digital twin for predicting sheet metal forming operation parameters. It advances 
towards integrating modeling and simulation, a MODSIM concept, for accurate predictions using real parameters. The developed 
digital twin was built using SolidWorks Simulation® platform.  The plastic model of the material was implemented. The 
developed simulation model was evaluated using various materials and bending angles, demonstrating concordance between the 
simulation results and both experimental and empirical data. This validates the digital twin's capability to predict sheet metal 
bending manufacturing parameters, such as springback angle and press loading capacity, thereby improving manufacturing 
processes, optimizing designs, and addressing economic and sustainability considerations.

Abstract 
 
The research investigates how green supply chain and logistics management (GSCM) functions in Oman’s oil and gas sector 
by evaluating present operations alongside the challenges and opportunities that exist for better practices. The research 
applied a mixed-methods approach through surveys, focus groups, and benchmarking analysis to discover major 
deficiencies in sustainability initiatives specifically related to reverse logistics and circular economy integration. Green 
procurement has become a standard practice thanks to regulatory pressure but sustainable transportation and waste 
management systems still need development. Evaluating against global best practices demonstrates that the absence of 
enforcement systems and financial motivators combined with insufficient awareness among supply chain managers 
constitute the main obstacles to successful GSCM implementation. 
 
Research demonstrates that targeted policy changes along with technological progress and improved corporate 
environmental responsibility will enable Oman’s oil and gas industry to boost its sustainability performance. The research 
study presents a practical framework that combines green supply chain strategies with digital tracking technology and AI 
logistics optimization alongside workforce training to drive successful implementation. The research identifies economic 
and environmental gains from moving towards a sustainable supply chain model that corresponds with the sustainability 
targets of Oman’s Vision 2040. The study delivers practical recommendations that serve both academic research and 
industry application by supporting sustainable transformation efforts in Oman’s oil and gas field.","© IEOM Society International

demonstrates that workforce training programs which integrate GSCM concepts help organizations implement green 
supply chain management better because employees understand its benefits and operational impacts. 
According to research findings Oman's oil and gas industry can achieve regional leadership in sustainable logistics 
provided essential obstacles are resolved. The proposed framework alongside policy recommendations calls for 
enhanced government regulations together with financial incentives and industry collaboration as essential factors for 
speeding up the adoption of green supply chains. The research shows that moving towards sustainable logistics will 
help Oman achieve its Vision 2040 goals while simultaneously improving business resilience, cutting long-term costs 
and boosting international competitiveness in the energy market. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The research examines green supply chain and logistics management within Oman’s oil and gas industry by evaluating 
current practices alongside existing challenges and potential opportunities for progress. Through benchmarking global 
best practices the study identifies implementation gaps while offering a structured framework for sustainable supply 
chain integration. Research shows that multiple companies understand sustainability's value but face substantial 
obstacles including regulatory constraints and resistance to change which obstruct its complete implementation. 
Structured interventions such as policy changes, corporate strategy development and workforce education enable 
businesses to achieve quantifiable progress in environmental sustainability and economic performance. 
 
The research advances both scholarly understanding and industrial procedures through its empirical findings related 
to sustainable supply chain management practices in Oman. The research demonstrates how green logistics adoption 
delivers significant economic and environmental advantages through decreased emissions and cost savings while 
boosting operational efficiency. The study provides policy advice for regulatory agencies to enforce sustainable 
standards and motivates businesses to actively pursue green supply chain practices. The framework operates with 
adaptability to allow businesses of different scales to adopt sustainable practices seamlessly into their current 
operations. The study outcomes support Oman’s Vision 2040 sustainability objectives by establishing the oil and gas 
industry as a principal force in driving both environmental and economic changes within the country. Oman will 
become more competitive on the international stage by supporting sustainable supply chain practices while also 
making significant contributions to climate protection and resource preservation. The research provides essential 
groundwork that supports continued study and sector-wide improvements through collaborative efforts between 
policymakers and industry leaders alongside academic institutions which aim to establish durable supply chain 
systems.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to improve the Conformity of Production (CoP) testing process in a motorcycle manufacturing plant 
in Thailand to enhance operational efficiency, reduce lead time, and lower costs associated with test scraps. Value 
Stream Mapping (VSM) was utilized to analyze the current process and identify waste, and a Fishbone Diagram was 
used to analyze the root causes of problems. The process was then improved by applying the ECRS principles 
(Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, Simplify) to eliminate unnecessary steps, reduce redundancies, and optimize 
resource management. The results showed that the number of process steps was reduced from 15 steps to 11 steps, 
and the total lead time decreased from 8.2 days to 5 days. These improvements enabled the timely return of 
motorcycles to the warehouse and reduced test scrap costs by 320,760.54 THB per year. Furthermore, the 
improvements maintained product quality standards in compliance with legal regulations and market requirements. 
This study highlights the significance of applying Lean Manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve 
efficiency in the manufacturing industry.

1. Introduction 
The motorcycle manufacturing industry is currently facing intensifying competition due to rapidly changing consumer 
demands and increasingly stringent legal regulations. Ensuring product quality complies with established standards 
and adhering strictly to regulatory requirements have become crucial factors influencing an organization's 
competitiveness and success. The Conformity of Production (CoP) testing process is vital in verifying that products 
from the production line maintain consistent quality and comply with legal requirements. This process helps to reduce 
risks with non-compliant products, prevent product recalls, enhance the company's reputation, minimize 
environmental impacts, and improve user safety. However, an analysis of operational data from the past year revealed 
that, out of 53 motorcycles tested, 10 units (19%), which were models sold in Thailand, encountered delays in 
returning to the warehouse within the target is 7-day set by the company's KPI as shown in Table 1, This directly","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

by 1,355 minutes and shortens the total lead time from 8.2 days to 5 days. The test time was reduced by 36%, 
surpassing the goal of 20% and ensuring 100% on-time return of motorcycles to the warehouse. 
 
2. Cost Reduction: The total savings were 320,760.54 Baht compared to last year. By eliminating the need for 
replacement parts, waste in the process was reduced by 100%, which exceeded the target of 15% and reduced 
unnecessary expenses for the organization 
 
6. Conclusion 
The process was improved by reducing the number of steps from 15 to 11, resulting in a 36% reduction in lead time, 
from 8.2 days to 5 days. This enhancement increased process efficiency and ensured the timely return of motorcycles 
to the warehouse, aligning with the company's Key Performance Indicator (KPI) target. Additionally, it helped reduce 
testing-related waste costs by 320,760.54 Baht annually, representing a 100% reduction in waste costs compared to 
the previous year. These improvements highlight the value of applying Lean Manufacturing principles, specifically 
Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Fishbone Diagram, and ECRS techniques, to eliminate non-value-added activities and 
optimize process efficiency. Beyond the quantifiable benefits, this study demonstrates the importance of systematic 
process analysis and continuous improvement in a highly competitive manufacturing environment. By streamlining 
operations, the company reduced operational inefficiencies, enhanced compliance with regulatory requirements, and 
improved overall production reliability. Reducing waste and unnecessary costs contributes to sustainable 
manufacturing practices, aligning with industry best practices and environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the 
findings from this study provide a practical framework for process optimization that can be adapted to other 
automotive and manufacturing sectors. The successful implementation of Lean Manufacturing principles in the CoP 
testing process underscores the potential for similar methodologies to be applied in other quality control and 
production systems, leading to broader efficiency gains.

Abstract 
Traditional tree-based methods, such as ID3, C4.5, C5.0, and CART, have played a fundamental role in machine 
learning due to their simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. These methods rely on a greedy, top-down recursive 
partitioning approach, which, while computationally efficient, can lead to locally optimal splits that may not reflect 
the best global structure of the data. One major challenge of this approach is controlling overfitting, particularly when 
trees grow too deep and capture noise instead of meaningful patterns. While tree depth is a tunable hyperparameter, 
selecting the optimal depth remains difficult, as it requires balancing model complexity and generalization. 
Additionally, traditional decision trees primarily rely on axis-aligned splits, limiting their ability to model complex, 
nonlinear relationships. Handling missing values is another challenge, as many traditional methods require imputation 
or heuristic-based surrogate splits, which can introduce biases. However, some implementations, like CART, provide 
built-in surrogate splits to address missing data. Moreover, decision trees may face scalability issues in high-
dimensional spaces, where selecting optimal splits becomes increasingly expensive. To overcome these limitations, 
researchers have explored ensemble methods, optimization-based approaches, and hybrid models. Despite these 
drawbacks, traditional decision trees remain widely used due to their interpretability, ease of use, and strong baseline 
performance in machine learning tasks.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, progress has been made in overcoming the technological challenge of gluten-free final quality in 
gluten-free products using potential ingredients and optimized processing conditions. However, the nutritional 
profile of these products is often inferior compared to their gluten-containing versions, which can negatively affect 
those who follow a lifelong gluten-free diet, such as people with celiac disease. This can lead to nutritional 
deficiencies, weight gain, and digestive health problems. For this reason, the main objective of this research was 
to formulate and produce a gluten-free bread based on canihua flour (Chenopodium pallidicaule), quinoa flour 
(Chenopodium quinoa) and sweet potato starch (Ipomoea batatas) as main ingredients, with a high protein and 
crude fiber content. Seven formulations were developed, varying the percentages of the ingredients using the mix 
design method. In addition, different methodologies were used to determine the percentage of protein, fiber, 
sensory evaluation and humidity, in order to identify the optimal formula from the results obtained. As a result, 
the optimal formulation was the one that combined 66,67% canihua flour, 16,6% quinoa flour and 16,6% sweet 
potato starch, reaching a protein content of 12,12% and a fiber percentage of 1,32 %. In conclusion, the use of 
canihua flour, quinoa flour and sweet potato starch in the production of gluten-free bread represents a promising 
alternative to improve the nutritional profile of these products, while at the same time making it possible to 
overcome the challenges related to the absence of gluten, which is positively reflected in the final sensory 
properties of the bread.

Introduction 
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which a person's immune system responds adversely to the gluten 
present in their diet (De la Calle et al. 2020). That is, the ingestion of gluten, a protein present in wheat, causes an 
abnormal immune response in the body that damages the mucosa of the small intestine and hinders the absorption 
of essential nutrients from foods such as carbohydrates and proteins (Salehi 2019). The prevalence of celiac 
disease is 1% to 2% worldwide (Arslan et al. 2019; De la Calle et al. 2020). The only treatment or remedy that","© IEOM Society International

This is reinforced by the result obtained by Valino et al. (2020), adding 10% sweet potato starch in another formula 
increasing its specific volume to 1,73 ml/g. In the sensory evaluation, Saby Zegarra & Ramos Escudero (2019) 
used a 5-point hedonic scale in celiac consumers to evaluate attributes such as taste, smell and color, without 
finding significant variations between their three gluten-free bread formulations. They used cañihua flour, cassava 
starch and corn starch, highlighting the formula with the highest acceptability, which contained less cañihua flour 
and corn starch, and a greater amount of cassava starch, xanthan gum, yeast and egg. In comparison, our formulas 
with the highest acceptability were 1 and 2, with more cañihua flour than quinoa flour and sweet potato starch. 
This differs in terms of the proportion of cañihua flour, which in our study was used in greater quantities to achieve 
sensory acceptability, possibly due to the exotic and novel flavor of cañihua. Regarding moisture, Ronnie et al. 
(2023) made 4 gluten-free bread formulas with rice flour and potato starch, obtaining a moisture content between 
34.90% and 41.22%, within the permissible range of 35% to 45%. However, our results were significantly lower, 
with a maximum of 24.76% in formula 2, which used 100% cañihua flour. These low moisture values caused the 
breads to be dry and hard. The cause of these results could be the baking time and high temperatures, since the 
cañihua breads were baked at 300 °C for 20 minutes, while the rice breads in the study by Ronnie et al. (2023) 
were baked at more moderate temperatures between 165 °C and 225 °C. To improve moisture, it is suggested to 
reduce the baking temperature to 180°C or 220°C and increase the baking time to allow for adequate moisture 
retention. 
Miranda et al. (2018) developed 20 gluten-free bread formulations with a protein content between 7.3% and 9.5%, 
thanks to white lupine and quinoa flour, outperforming breads made with rice flour and corn starch. In our results, 
the 5 formulations showed a protein content between 10.46% and 13.96%, mainly due to the use of quinoa and 
cañihua flours. Remilekun et al. (2023) reached a maximum of 8.48% protein with rice sourdough bread, while 
Ronie et al. (2023) achieved only 10.5% with rice flour and potato starch. In comparison, our formula 2, with 
100% cañihua flour, reached 13.96%, showing a clear nutritional difference between traditional cereals such as 
rice and pseudocereals such as cañihua and quinoa. The maximum crude fibre content in our research was 1.32%, 
not reaching the target of exceeding 4%. Valino et al. (2020) indicate that starch reduces fibre content by removing 
fibrous components during its production process. Bugarín et al. (2023) suggest that citrus fibre improves crumb 
hydration, cohesion and elasticity, which could have helped to increase fibre content in our study. Although 4% 
was not exceeded, the use of citrus fibre could have brought the target closer. Ronie et al. (2023) obtained between 
0.64% and 0.89% fibre in their rice breads, probably by using processed flours without the outer layer of the 
cereal, where the fibre is concentrated. 
 
5.Conclusions 
Seven preliminary gluten-free bread formulations were developed by applying an experimental design of mixtures 
with different proportions of canihua flour, quinoa flour and sweet potato starch. This allowed exploring various 
combinations to find the best formulation based on criteria such as maximizing protein and fiber.A detailed 
manufacturing process was established, including dough preparation, fermentation and baking times and 
temperatures. This stage is crucial to guarantee the quality of gluten-free bread and a consistent and reproducible 
procedure was defined. 
 
Through the analysis of various characteristics such as specific volume, moisture, color, smell, taste, protein and 
fiber content, the best formulation was identified, achieving an improvement in the nutritional profile, surpassing 
the protein and fiber content compared to gluten-free breads made in previous research. The optimal bread from 
this research has 12,11% protein and 1,32% fiber. The challenge of making gluten-free bread was also overcome, 
as shown in the results of sensory and rheological tests. However, the moisture, fiber and specific volume content 
must be improved to obtain a product with greater acceptability.

Abstract  
 
Efficient warehouse management in the textile sector is crucial for optimizing material flow and reducing production 
errors. However, many companies face challenges related to space utilization, material identification, and process 
standardization, which impact operational efficiency. This research applies Lean Manufacturing tools to improve raw 
material warehouse management, aiming to increase service levels and optimize operational processes. Systematic 
Layout Planning (SLP), Poka Yoke, and Time Study were implemented to reorganize material flow, reduce errors, 
and minimize idle times. As a result, the average time between batch outputs was reduced from 3.3 to 2.8 hours, while 
the number of defect-free batches increased from 3 to 5 per day, representing a 33.33% improvement. These tools 
enabled process optimization, improved inventory management, and reduced operational variability. The findings 
highlight the importance of adapting Lean Manufacturing methodologies to the specific characteristics of the textile 
sector, enhancing competitiveness and sustainability. This study provides an improvement model applicable to other 
companies facing similar warehouse management challenges.

1. Introduction  
The textile sector is one of the most significant industries in emerging economies, contributing approximately 7% of 
global manufacturing GDP and generating employment for more than 75 million workers worldwide (Alcazar‑Quispe 
et al. 2024). In Peru, this sector plays a crucial role, accounting for 7.6% of the national manufacturing GDP and 
providing approximately 398,000 jobs. However, despite its economic importance, textile SMEs face significant 
operational challenges, such as high defect rates (above 10%), inefficient material handling, and long production 
times, which directly affect their competitiveness and profitability (Ortiz Porras et al. 2022; Trojanowska et al. 2023).","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the integration of System Layout Planning (SLP), Poka Yoke and Time Study contributed to increase 
the fulfillment of complete orders in the warehouse of the studied company, increasing the number of batches from 3 
to 5, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model proposed. Time Study played a vital role in obtaining standard 
times for each activity conducted in the study area. Through Poka Yoke, using stickers to mark defects and controlling 
the average weight of rolls of fabric received, allowed a reduction from 1 to 0 defective batches. Finaly, SLP technique 
for better distribution of work areas, reducing the cycle time in the warehouse from 11.6 to 9.6 hours and the time 
between departures from 3.3 to 2.8 hours. This approach can be highly beneficial for future studies focused on 
improving organization and inventory operations as it offers adaptable and efficient solutions tailored to specific 
challenges.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
 
Digital Twin (DT) technology offers significant potential to enhance supply chains performances. Thus, the adoption 
of DTs in food supply chains (FSCs), will have enormous promise for improving sustainability, efficiency, and 
resilience This paper presents a conceptual framework based on a rapid review of DT applications in FSCs and divided 
into three sections. The first section provides a literature review on DT components, and FSC sustainability challenges. 
The second section explores the implementations of DT in FSCs, examining integration levels, key findings, benefits 
such as waste reduction and improved traceability. Building on these insights, this article develops a comprehensive 
framework for integrating DT into FSC sustainability, emphasizing its application in pre-adoption, adoption, and post-
adoption phases. The framework identifies DT capabilities, technological enablers, barriers, and the economic, social, 
and environmental impacts of DT adoption, in the context of FSC sustainability. This study highlights critical 
opportunities in the field, contributing to advancing the application of DT as a strategic enabler of resilient and 
sustainable food systems.

1. Introduction  
The FSC is, in essence, the heart of food security and sustainability. Some of the most significant challenges faced by 
it include inefficiencies, food loss and waste, and environmental influences. Global pressures, such as climate change 
and a growing population, are growing in magnitude and conspicuously excruciating vulnerabilities in contemporary 
FSC models due to such disruptive occurrences as the US-China Trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine. Integrating innovative technologies is essential to enhance the sustainability and resilience of the 
FSC (Ivanov & Dolgui  2021). Among these innovations, Digital Twin (DT) technology is considered promising 
solutions. A DT is a virtual representation of a physical thing enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and 
optimization of processes (Tao et al. 2019). Since DTs provide insights into complex systems, they then support 
improved decision-making, predictive maintenance, and resource optimization.","Proceedings of the6thAfricanInternational Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

impressive sustainability results, including diminished food loss and waste, reduced energy and water use, and lower 
carbon emissions. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study presents a full review and report on the digital twin applications in food supply chains, showing the 
transformative potential in solving the immediate issues of sustainability. By analyzing 28 academic articles, the study 
identifies key components in the DTs-integration of real-time data, predictive analytics, and decision support-toward 
integrating into the sustainability principles of the FSCs. The review showed DTs would yield many benefits, 
including better food traceability, reduced food waste, and improved efficiency in the operational processes; however, 
there still exist challenges, such as technological complexity, data interoperability problems, and high cost to 
implement. 
 
The conceptual framework laid out points the way forward in employing DT technologies to enhance food supply 
chain sustainability, placing emphasis on collaborative efforts amongst parties, technological innovation, and 
supportive policies, thereby accentuating the possible use of DTs as strategic tools in building resilient and sustainable 
food systems, in synchrony with global goals such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Future research should direct towards addressing technical and organizational barriers, toward establishing 
standardized frameworks, as well as exploring the role of emerging technologies in DT-enabled food supply chains 
like blockchain and artificial intelligence. This study will contribute towards a growing understanding and realization 
of the DTs in food supply chains, thus providing insights for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers.

Abstract 
 
The metalworking sector has experienced continuous growth in production over recent years, fueled by the rise in 
industrial exports and associated activities. As a result, evaluating production processes has become increasingly 
important. One of the most significant challenges for companies in this sector is the warehouse picking process. A key 
factor in this process is the time required for completion, as excessive delays can lead to production bottlenecks. This 
study proposes the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools, Systematic Layout Planning (SLP), and barcode 
technology to optimize picking time in the warehouse of a small or medium-sized metalworking enterprise. Following 
the implementation of these tools, the company successfully redesigned the warehouse layout, achieving a 71.15% 
reduction in picking time and eliminating rework.

1. Introduction 
 
The manufacturing industry falls under the secondary sector of the economy and includes various subsectors, such as 
textiles, agribusiness, mining, steel, woodworking, oil, and metalworking. The metalworking sector plays a crucial 
role in the global economy. The countries with the strongest presence in this industry include the United States, 
Germany, Spain, and Japan (Di Natale et al. 2017). Although Peru is not ranked among the most developed countries 
in this sector, it has achieved an annual growth rate of 10.2% and accounts for 13.6% of the total manufacturing 
industry (Institute of Economic and Social Studies, 2018). Additionally, it represents 1.7% of Peru's GDP (Institute of 
Economic and Social Studies 2019). An important factor is that the metalworking sector remains closely linked to all 
areas of the economy, including mining and construction, which depend on its various products, such as machinery, 
components, and equipment (Tavera Colonna 2020). According to Srisuk and Tippayawomg (2020), industries must 
reduce costs and increase profitability in response to the recent economic crisis. For this reason, they recommend","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

5.3 Validation 
The proposed model was validated through a pilot test of the 5S methodology in a material and tool pickup area, along 
with a simulation in Arena software applied to SLP and ABC analysis. The optimal number of replications (N=30) 
was determined to minimize the margin of error. By running the initial and final scenario simulations, it was confirmed 
that the proposed scenario demonstrates a significant improvement.

The metalworking sector faces inefficiencies in the picking process, leading to delays and additional costs. To optimize 
this process, tools such as Lean Manufacturing, SLP, and barcode systems were implemented, achieving a 71.15% 
reduction in picking time and eliminating rework. 
The warehouse redesign, incorporating 5S, ABC, and SLP, enhanced space utilization, reduced search times, and 
streamlined material flow. As a result, the picking time decreased from 21.7 to 11.4 minutes, significantly enhancing 
operational efficiency.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
 
The aerodynamic performance of Formula Student cars serves a crucial role in handling the speed and stability in 
lower speed racings, compared to Formula One cars. Selecting the appropriate aerofoil depending on Reynolds 
Number impacts for the car’s rear wing is critical, especially in optimizing aerodynamic efficiency across varying 
driving conditions like crosswinds. This paper is specifically focused on how the Low and High Reynolds Number 
aerofoil impacts on the racing track. To compare, SD7032 and NACA0015 aerofoil model has been chosen for 
numerical analysis under varying speeds from 30 to 120 km/h with 0º to -90º adjustable angles of attack. Through this 
comparative analysis, the NACA0015 model shows significantly less generative drag and higher negative lift than 
SD7032 model aerofoil, which reflects better performance during speeding event at 0º to -10º angles of attack. 
Meanwhile, as the SD7032 model generates higher drag and generative negative lift, this aerofoil shows comparatively 
better performance during braking event with adjusting the aerofoil in -60º to -90º angles of attack. This state while 
braking is crucial, because it creates excessive resistance during acceleration. As Formula Student cars are margined 
to obtain between 200-300 kg weight, this higher drag can be sensitive while speeding in light weight cars with high 
turbulent boundary layers. As a result, SD7032 model provides a superior negative lift-to-drag ratio specifically for 
braking events and ensures a good aerodynamic stability.","Proceedings of the6thAfricanInternational Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

It portrays that NACA0015 can be used for accelerating event, if the coefficients of downforce are not taken in count, 
as shown in Figure 30. It is clearly showing that the 60º to 90º angles of attack is generating lift force, rather than 
downforce. However, the coefficient of lift is significantly higher in SD7032 model aerofoil during the braking events, 
illustrated in Figure 31. But, during 90º angle of attack, the aerofoil is generating lift force. In summary, during the 
speeding event, the 0º to 10º adjustable angles of attack can be implemented for various controls. The 60º angle of 
attack can be implemented during braking events, as it generates a sufficient amount of drag force using SD7032 
model compared to NACA0015 model aerofoil. But NACA0015 started generating lift force during 60º angle of 
attack. However, 90º angle of attack is not suitable for braking event in both the aerofoils, as it is not generating any 
downforce to grip the track. Rather than, it is generating lift force which can end up in losing the control of the vehicle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This study was completely based on numerical analysis. To obtain near real-world results, the authors conducted 
transient simulations. Due to the limitation of grid cells in the student version of Ansys Fluent 2025 R1, it is uncertain 
whether full grid convergence was reached in the current study. Future work should include a systematic grid 
convergence analysis by performing simulations at multiple grid resolutions and evaluating changes in key 
aerodynamic parameters. A grid independence study would confirm whether the chosen mesh is sufficient for accurate 
results or if refinements in grids are necessary. However, numerical simulations alone are not enough. It is always 
advised to test aerofoils in actual wind tunnels and conduct test runs using Formula Student cars on racing tracks to 
validate computational results. Another key improvement involves considering the influence of upstream components 
on the rear wing. This study assumes a uniform free-stream flow reaching the aerofoil, which simplifies real-world 
conditions. However, in practical applications, components such as the driver’s head, roll bar, and overall car body 
alter the flow characteristics by creating turbulent wakes and affecting the effective angle of attack and pressure 
distribution. Future research should incorporate a full vehicle CFD model to account for these influences, providing a 
more realistic aerodynamic representation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study compared the aerodynamic performance of the SD7032 and NACA0015 model aerofoils for Formula 
Student applications under transient flow conditions. The results indicate that the NACA0015 aerofoil produces lower 
drag, making it more suitable for rapid acceleration. However, its inability to generate significant drag during braking, 
limits its effectiveness in high downforce events. In contrast, the SD7032 aerofoil demonstrated superior downforce

generation and increased drag under braking conditions, making it a more suitable model for use in Formula Student 
vehicles, specifically for enhancing stability in crosswind conditions and improving braking performance. Due to 
computational conditions imposed by the Student Version of Ansys Fluent 2025 R1, the study faced limitations in 
grid resolution and turbulence modeling. However, the transient simulations closely replicated real-world 
aerodynamic behaviours. Additionally, a virtual wind tunnel model designed based on the Armfield C15 wind tunnel, 
was employed to simulate real-world testing conditions, ensuring a controlled and comparative aerodynamic analysis. 
Future studies should focus on grid convergence analysis, higher-fidelity turbulence models to further validate these 
findings.

Abstract 
 
Grocery shopping, a routine activity, becomes a significant challenge for individuals with visual impairments (PVIs) 
due to barriers in accessing product information such as nutritional facts, allergens, and expiration dates. This study 
introduces GaBuy, a multimodal sensory-integrated (MSID) assistive device designed to enhance the grocery 
shopping experience for PVIs by addressing key variables: independence, readability, convenience, accuracy, and 
efficiency. Initial surveys conducted with 35 visually impaired participants identified critical pain points, including 
difficulties in locating products, reading labels, and relying on external assistance. These insights guided the design 
and development of GaBuy, which integrates text-to-speech capabilities and streamlined product identification 
features. A simulation-based study compared participants' experiences between traditional grocery shopping methods 
(pre-treatment) and the use of GaBuy (post-treatment). Data analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test revealed 
statistically significant improvements across all five key variables. Participants reported increased autonomy, reduced 
cognitive strain, and greater ease in acquiring essential product details, highlighting GaBuy's potential. This research 
bridges existing gaps in assistive technology by offering a user-centered solution that promotes inclusivity, 
independence, and accessibility for PVIs in grocery shopping environments. GaBuy sets a benchmark for future 
innovations, empowering PVIs to navigate daily tasks with confidence and dignity.

including difficulties in accessing product information, reliance on external assistance, and inefficiencies in product 
identification. In response, an innovative solution was developed by integrating text-to-speech technology, product 
identification features, and an intuitive interface tailored to the needs of PVIs. The device's effectiveness was then 
evaluated using a simulation-based study and a rigorous simulation-based evaluation. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank 
Test confirmed statistical improvements with p-values equal to 0.00 across five key variables: independence, allowing 
PVIs to shop with minimal assistance; readability, enhancing access to product information; convenience, making the 
shopping process smoother and less stressful; accuracy, ensuring precise product identification; and efficiency, 
reducing the time required for shopping. 
Beyond addressing grocery shopping challenges, this study contributes to the landscape of assistive technology, 
inclusive design, and human-centered innovation. Unlike existing solutions focusing solely on navigation or object 
recognition, GaBuy pioneers a holistic, multi-sensory approach for a more comprehensive assistive tool. Furthermore, 
this study sets a benchmark for future innovations, demonstrating the potential of user-driven assistive devices and 
paving the way for further advancements in accessibility solutions. The findings also emphasize promoting inclusive 
retail practices, ergonomic design, accessibility-focused store environments, and adaptive technologies tailored for 
PVIs.  
In conclusion, this research underscores the value of cross-disciplinary collaboration, combining industrial 
engineering, human factors, and technology to meet the needs of PVIs. Through data-driven design and iterative 
prototyping, the study demonstrates the potential of user-driven assistive technology in enhancing accessibility. 
Validating the effectiveness of GaBuy offers valuable insights for the future of inclusive retail environments and 
assistive device development. Ultimately, this research calls for continued innovation and advocacy, ensuring that 
accessibility remains a fundamental right.

1. Introduction 
In the ever-evolving landscape of Supply Chain Management (SCM), external forces, changing consumer behaviors, 
and technological progress continually shape this dynamic arena. Johnson and Smith's (2021) review underscores the 
need for adaptive strategies in SCM. The traditional focus on efficient goods movement has transformed, driven by 
technological advancements, global interconnectedness, and consumer expectations. Integration of technologies like 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics has shifted SCM from reactive to proactive 
models. 
 
Globalization has interconnected supply chains across borders, necessitating real-time visibility, communication, and 
collaboration. Sustainability considerations are now integral to SCM, with eco-friendly practices and circular supply 
chain models becoming prominent. In conclusion, the evolving SCM landscape demands adaptation to advanced 
technologies, global networks, sustainability, and circularity for organizations to remain competitive and responsive. 
The growing significance of AI and information systems marks a transformative era in SCM. Leveraging AI for 
predictive analytics enables proactive adjustments to inventory, logistics, and overall responsiveness, enhancing 
customer satisfaction. Advanced demand forecasting with AI optimizes inventory levels and reduces operational costs.

this future validation pathway emphasizes the real-world relevance and transformative potential of AI-integrated 
supply chain frameworks in life-critical domains 
 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper has explored the transformative role of AI and information systems in supply chain management (SCM), 
emphasizing their potential to enhance operational efficiency, risk management, and customer satisfaction. Key 
findings include: 
Predictive analytics improves forecast accuracy and helps reduce inventory costs. 
AI-driven demand forecasting boosts operational efficiency and elevates customer satisfaction. 
Decision Support Systems (DSS) optimize logistics and resource allocation. 
The integration of AI and information systems creates a more connected, responsive, and efficient supply chain 
ecosystem, as demonstrated by several real-world case studies. 
 
However, to fully unlock the potential of AI in SCM, certain challenges must be addressed, particularly data security, 
system integration, and workforce readiness. One of the most crucial aspects for success is achieving seamless 
interoperability between AI and information systems. This can be accomplished through strategies like adopting 
industry standards, utilizing APIs, implementing middleware solutions, harmonizing data, using Master Data 
Management (MDM) practices, prioritizing real-time data exchange, fostering collaborative platforms, designing 
scalable architectures, and continuous monitoring and testing. Collaboration with technology providers will also be 
critical for ensuring that these integrations function effectively across all levels of the supply chain. 
 
Policy and Managerial Implications 
For Policymakers: Establish frameworks to support AI adoption in SCM, including funding for workforce training 
and incentives for technology integration. 
For Industry Leaders: Invest in AI-driven technologies and prioritize workforce readiness through targeted training 
programs and skill development initiatives. 
For Researchers: Conduct cross-industry comparisons to identify best practices and explore the ethical implications 
of AI in SCM. 
 
As part of future research, validation of the proposed model could be conducted through its application in the organ 
transplantation supply chain in Morocco. This context presents unique challenges related to fragmentation, data 
sharing, and timely decision-making, which could be addressed by integrating AI and information systems. A real-
world study would not only validate the proposed framework but also provide valuable insights into its impact on 
operational efficiency, responsiveness, and patient outcomes. 
By tackling these challenges and leveraging the opportunities presented by AI, organizations can build a more 
intelligent, adaptive, and interconnected supply chain ecosystem that is equipped to meet the demands of modern 
markets.

Abstract 
 
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippines shifted to distance learning, later transitioning to hybrid setups with 
limited face-to-face classes. At the University of Santo Tomas (UST), hybrid learning has become a permanent setup. 
As this offers flexibility, it also brings challenges to students, as highlighted by related studies. The goal of this study is 
to assess and analyze behavioral, physical, and macro-ergonomic factors influencing their learning motivation and 
academic performance. A total of 287 engineering students in UST, using purposive sampling, answered the 
questionnaire in an online administered survey. Behavioral and ergonomic factors were analyzed using the Partial Least 
Square-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM). Results showed that attendance, student-centered method of teaching, 
and use of learning management system positively influence learning motivation which positively impacts their 
academic performance. The findings imply that students, academic teachers, and school administrators should be aware 
of and apply behavioral, physical, and macro-ergonomic concepts to positively influence students’ learning in a hybrid 
learning environment. As hybrid learning has become a norm in the university, it is essential that behavioral and 
ergonomic factors are considered to establish an effective learning system as it improves students’ learning motivation 
and academic performance in a hybrid learning setup.

Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant changes globally, impacting various sectors, including education. To 
address challenges in learning continuity, several countries, including the Philippines, adopted distance learning as the 
primary modality. In September 2021, former President Rodrigo Duterte approved the Commission on Higher 
Education’s (CHED) request to expand limited face-to-face classes for selected programs, including Engineering and",,,african 2025

Abstract  
 
The research offers a systematic literature review of the adoption of blockchain technology in manufacturing. The 
systematic literature review (SLR) presented by this paper follows a method of creating clear research questions that 
probe the relevant studies available to extract and assess the synthesizing of the relevant data to answer the research 
questions. The review investigates articles that have enquired on the application of blockchain into the different 
industries and moreover whether their finds can apply in the use of blockchain into the manufacturing industry. The 
findings of this SLR show that blockchain has been implemented in different manufacturing sections owing to its 
characteristics in handling, sharing, and processing data and records. A framework that addresses significant areas of 
future research on the topic is presented. Finally, the literature review lays the foundation for further studies on

1. Introduction  
Industries are adopting advanced technologies to enhance automation and, productivity, reduce costs, and improve 
traceability and reliability (Mohamed & Al-Jaroodi 2019). Technologies such as cloud computing, fog computing, 
IoT, blockchain, cyber-physical systems, and data analytics offer manufacturing benefits (Hamzah et al.  2023). Smart 
manufacturing creates a connected network that improves operations. Product recalls and failures negatively impact 
manufacturers’ sales and reputation, making it essential to address these challenges early (Bortoli & Freundt 
2017). The Wall Street Journal highlighted the significance of blockchain (Kursh & Gold 2016), with a predicted 
market growth of $176 billion by 2025 (Kramer 2019), prompting this research on its application in product lifecycle 
management. Therefore, this research therefore investigates through a literature review the application of blockchain 
technology in manufacturing to support the ideals of product lifecycle management. The research looks at different 
research articles that investigated the application of blockchain technology as solution to address manufacturing 
concerns.",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
 
In recent years, the Peruvian garment industry suffered drops in its production levels and its participation in the 
national market due to the low level of productive efficiency of its companies. In the cutting process of a garment 
company, productive problems were found such as defective overproduction, disorganization of the area and 
unproductive times that did not add value. The objective of the research is to propose an improvement model using 
Lean Manufacturing tools, specifically 5s, Kanban, SMED and Poka-Yoke, to increase the productivity level, 
currently at 78.12%. The results showed an increase in productivity of 10.78%, a reduction in defective production by 
5.43% and a decrease in setup time of 12.03 minutes. These results were validated through a simulation of the tools 
in Arena 14.0, demonstrating the validity of the proposed model.

1. Introduction 
In Peru, the textile industry is of significant importance due to its strong economic impact on the country. This industry 
is the third activity with the highest contribution to the manufacturing GDP with a 6.49% share in 2019 (SNI  2021); 
and represents 3.7% of total national exports and 6.6% of exported items in the last ten years (PRODUCE 2020). 
However, the sector has fallen 1.5% each year in the last decade in contrast to the positive annual variation of the 
national GDP of 3.6% and the manufacturing GDP of 1.7% due to lower productive activity caused by low technology, 
labor costs, infrastructure, and informality, which resulted in lower participation in the national economy (SNI 2022). 
The pandemic affected all manufacturing industries in 2020. According to the SNI (2021), the apparel subsector fell 
by 35.9% and the textile subsector fell by 25.7% with respect to 2019, generating a sector drop of 32.1%. In recent 
years, it has registered a decreased production level, which distances it from the levels registered in past seasons.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

6. Conclusion 
The implementation of the Lean Manufacturing tools was of vital importance for the improvement of the productivity 
of the fabric cutting process since, when applied correctly and with appropriate standardization and commitment on 
the part of the workers, they facilitate the reduction of waste and unproductive time. At the end of the implementation 
of the improvements, productivity of 87.56% was achieved, representing an increase of 9.44% compared to the initial 
value of 9.44%, demonstrating the reduction of the technical gap of the indicator and validating the contribution of 
the methodology conducted to obtain better manufacturing efficiency. 
The 5s tool improved the level of organization and distribution of materials and resources in the work area by 
establishing classification and cleaning measures, Kanban and Poka-Yoke improved production flow control thanks 
to visual and faulty production control, and SMED reduced waiting times between processes to achieve a reduction in 
total cycle time, thus generating a more efficient cut.In conclusion, the results obtained validate the improvements 
achieved in the organization thanks to Lean Manufacturing tools and their impact on efficiency, effectiveness and 
productivity, demonstrating that they are a valuable alternative for streamlining processes, optimizing manufacturing 
work and obtaining better results.

Abstract 
 
This research seeks to assess the business processes within the songket industry, which has been notably affected 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry encountered a dramatic decline in orders, leading to a significant drop 
in revenue alongside increased operational costs. In response, the industry adopted measures such as workforce 
reductions. Nevertheless, as conditions have started to improve, customer orders have resumed. Consequently, the 
industry is in need of a strategy for effectively managing customer demand with the current workforce levels. 
Steps have been taken to enhance internal processes aimed at reducing production time and facilitating 
subcontracting of orders to alleviate the situation; however, these initiatives have yet to produce the anticipated 
outcomes, thereby jeopardizing the sustainability of the industry due to inadequate income. The primary objective 
of this research is to effectively tackle these challenges. To accomplish this, the study focuses on identifying the 
optimal resources and critical production time required to satisfy customer demands and boost industry 
profitability. Utilizing iGrafx software for business process re-engineering, the research indicates improvements 
in process efficiency: Kain Betabur recorded an 8.68% increase in process time, Kain Songket Bunga Penuh saw 
a marginal increase of 0.29%, and Kain Beragi Penuh experienced a growth of 0.85%. These findings present a 
viable solution to the challenges faced by the industry, paving the way for sustainable growth and enhanced time 
performance.

1. Introduction 
During the period of the Covid-19 pandemic, industries worldwide faced unprecedented challenges and 
difficulties (Fitri & Zuryani 2022; Nurnazmi et al. 2021). The impact was significant for industries, including 
essential and non-essential goods industries that primarily operated through conventional means (Johan G. Ony, 
2021). The pandemic had a profound effect on these industries, leading to severe consequences (Salleh & Bushroa 
2022). For essential goods industry, this effect was not profound because it was supported by Government such 
as tax deduction (Nurnazmi et al. 2021). Otherwise for non-essential goods industry contributed to the difficulties 
faced such as layoffs, reduced purchasing power, and declining demand. (Johan G. 2021). 
 
The songket industry, like many other industries, was significantly impacted by the pandemic (Feri et al. 2022). 
The focus of this research is songket industry in Air Hitam Village, Indonesia. This industry faced significant 
challenges and almost collapsed, struggling to survive (Fitri & Zuryani  2022). The impact of the pandemic led to","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

4. Conclusion 
Industry around the world experienced extraordinary issues and problems During the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
pandemic had an enormous effect on the songket industry, as it did on many other industries. The industry 
witnessed a sharp decline in orders, leading to a substantial decrease in income and increased expenses. Measures 
like worker reduction were implemented during the crisis, and while customers resumed placing orders as 
conditions improved, the industry still needed a strategy to effectively manage customer demand with the existing 
workforce. Despite efforts to improve internal processes and subcontract orders, the desired results were not 
achieved. 
Industry should do identifying optimal resources and critical production times to meet customer demands and 
enhance industry profitability. Utilizing iGrafx software for business process re-engineering, the study revealed 
improvements in process efficiency, such as Kain Betabur achieved an increase of 8.68% in process time, Kain 
Songket Bunga Penuh experienced a slight increase of 0.29%, and Kain Beragi Penuh saw an increase of 0.85%. 
These findings offer a viable solution to the challenges the industry faced, paving the way for sustainable growth 
and improved financial performance.In summary, the research highlights the weaknesses in the current business 
process and proposes potential improvements that can lead to increased efficiency, reduced cycle time, and higher 
profits. The findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the production process of songket.

Nevertheless, SMEs are facing tremendous and restrictive external and internal challenges deterring their long-term 
survival and contributions. Moreover, previous studies in these regards focused on developed countries’ context and 
more on the important external factors without prioritizing their impact. Therefore, this study aims to examine the 
internal factors and prioritize them based on their impact on the SMEs’ sustainable competitiveness from the least 
developed economic perspective taking Tigray as a case. The study used the Fuzzy Delphi Method to analyze the 
quantitative data collected using a questionnaire instrument. Sixteen senior experts from Universities, SME owners 
and managers, SME regional office directors and experts, and the regional Innovation, Science and Technology bureau 
have participated in the study. Based on literature reviews and discussions with the experts, 11 internal factors were 
selected for this study. The findings of the study revealed that all the factors are accepted with an expert consensus 
value above 75%, the threshold value (d) ≤ 0.2, and the fuzzy score value (A) ≥ 0.5.  Dynamic capability, product 
quality, Entrepreneurial capability, and Innovation capability are the top four internal factors that have an impact on 
the sustainable competitiveness of SMEs in their respective order. This research contributes to minimizing the research",,,african 2025

Abstract  
 
Breast cancer continues to impact millions globally, driving urgent demand for innovative tools to improve early 
detection. While AI and machine learning offer transformative potential in predicting breast cancer, their success 
hinges on overcoming significant data-related barriers. This work examines practical approaches to assembling robust 
datasets, such as tapping into open-access medical repositories, forging partnerships with hospitals and research 
networks, and combining diverse data streams—including clinical histories, imaging and molecular biomarkers. A 
key focus is ensuring datasets reflect varied demographics, geographies, and cancer subtypes to reduce algorithmic 
bias and enhance real-world applicability. Despite these efforts, obstacles persist. Strict patient privacy laws, 
institutional hesitancy to share sensitive health data, and fragmented annotation practices often stall progress. Limited 
availability of comprehensively labeled datasets and disparities in imaging equipment or protocols further compound 
these issues. To address these constraints, this study advocates for adaptive methodologies, such as cross-institutional 
data alliances that anonymize and aggregate records ethically, semi-supervised learning to extract insights from 
partially labeled data, and expert-guided annotation frameworks to improve label consistency. Additionally, 
harmonizing imaging standards and promoting interoperable formats could streamline data integration. By prioritizing 
these collaborative and methodological innovations, researchers can cultivate richer, more inclusive datasets while 
adhering to ethical guidelines. Advancing these strategies not only refines AI model accuracy but also strengthens 
trust in their clinical deployment, offering a pathway to earlier interventions and equitable care for diverse patient 
populations.

Abstract 
 
Foetal health monitoring is a vital component of prenatal care, ensuring the well-being of both mother and child. 
Traditional techniques such as cardiotocography (CTG) are widely used, however, they are often limited by subjective 
interpretation and time inefficiencies. There is also limited literature that presents guidelines on the application of 
machine learning in Foetal health status prediction, particularly addressing challenges such as data variability, model 
generalizability, and algorithmic bias. This paper presents findings from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that 
followed the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model. 
The SLR examined 42 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021 and 2024 from Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore 
databases. The findings indicate that while machine learning models like random forests and neural networks achieve 
high predictive accuracy, their performance is often limited by data variability, lack of generalizability across diverse 
populations, and algorithmic bias. By addressing these challenges, Machine Learning can improve foetal health 
outcomes, ensuring timely and accurate interventions. These findings inform healthcare policymakers on how to 
intervene and manage foetal health hence reducing the mortality and morbidity of mother and/or child. Researchers 
interested in maternal and foetal health will also benefit from the findings of this paper through adhering to the 
guidelines provided in the resultant framework to improve the health management of the foetus.

1. Introduction 
Foetal health monitoring is the cornerstone of prenatal care, aimed at identifying potential risks to safeguard maternal 
and foetal well-being. Traditional approaches, such as cardiotocography (CTG), are commonly employed to monitor 
foetal heart rate and uterine contractions, providing valuable insights into foetal health status. However, these methods 
are not without limitations. The manual interpretation of CTG data is inherently subjective and time-intensive, often 
leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy (Sunge et al. 2023). Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful",,,african 2025

Abstract 
  
This systematic literature review presents the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in managing monkeypox, 
emphasizing the necessity of a conceptual framework to enhance disease surveillance, optimize resource allocation, 
and enable timely interventions. Real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and automated alert systems can 
significantly strengthen outbreak response strategies. However, despite the growing use of IoT in healthcare, a crucial 
gap exists in the availability of dedicated conceptual frameworks tailored specifically for managing monkeypox and 
similar infectious diseases. Existing research primarily focusses on general IoT applications in healthcare and lacks a 
conceptual framework for guiding the intended users on what IoT technologies to choose from for the purpose of 
addressing the unique challenges of managing monkeypox during outbreaks. A conceptual framework is essential for 
an informed implementation of IoT for disease control and management. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) model, 597 articles were reviewed, with 24 selected articles 
included in the systematic literature review. The findings highlight an increased usage of wearable devices, mobile 
applications, and cloud-based systems in disease management. The research findings also demonstrate IoT’s 
transformative role in real-time data collection, patient monitoring, and community engagement. However, challenges 
such as geographic disparities, data privacy issues, and inconsistent technological adoption persist. This study 
underscores the pressing need for a structured IoT-based framework to bridge this gap in literature, for ensuring 
equitable and effective management of monkeypox and other infectious diseases through interdisciplinary 
collaboration, predictive modeling, and proactive public health strategies.

cross-sector collaborations. Additionally, ensuring accessibility and scalability in resource-limited settings will be 
crucial for the widespread adoption of this approach. Ultimately, an IoT-enabled Monkeypox management conceptual 
framework has provided the key IoT-based technologies that have a potential to revolutionize and inform public health 
care stakeholders of the key technologies for consideration in disease control strategies, mitigating outbreak risks and 
improving overall public health preparedness.

Abstract 
 
Exoskeleton technologies are machines that can be worn on part or the whole body of a human being to enhance 
mobility. Exoskeletons are and are revolutionizing healthcare. Despite their affordances, the adoption of exoskeletons 
in healthcare is low and there is limited literature with conceptual frameworks for integrating exoskeletons in 
healthcare. This paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating exoskeletons technology in healthcare. A 
systematic literature review (SLR), guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) model informed this research. Twenty-one peer reviewed articles drawn from databases such as 
SpringerLink, PubMed, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect. The findings show that the integration of exoskeleton 
technology in healthcare, provide innovative solutions for patients with mobility constraints. By providing consistent, 
repetitive, and task-specific training, exoskeletons enhance neuroplasticity and functional recovery, improving patient 
outcomes in rehabilitation. Furthermore, exoskeleton technology has various applications in healthcare, which include 
rehabilitation and elderly care, simplifies patient handling, aides’ mobility and provides surgical support. The findings 
of the study identified the reasons for the low uptake of exoskeleton technology which involve high costs of the 
exoskeleton technology, technical complexities, and safety concerns. These findings inform the health care policies 
makers, management, health care workers and patients with mobility constraints on how to integrate exoskeletons to 
improve the health care management.

Abstract 
 
In the current global economy, increasing efficiency and profitability requires supply chain optimization. This article 
examines Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) as a crucial instrument in supply chain management (SCM). OEE, 
derived from Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), assesses equipment availability, performance, and quality, thereby 
enhancing operational efficiency. The study emphasizes that the integration of OEE with contemporary SCM 
approaches may result in substantial improvements in productivity, cost efficiency, and responsiveness.  
The literature study delineates the progression of Supply Chain Management (SCM) from its emergence in the 1980s, 
highlighting the increasing intricacy of supply networks attributable to globalization and technology innovations. The 
text examines many solutions for supply chain optimization, including inventory management and demand 
forecasting, augmented by advancements like artificial intelligence and huge data. The adaptability of OEE across 
many sectors is analysed, highlighting its use in areas like mining, transportation, and urban freight. The study

1.Introduction 
In today's interconnected global marketplace, optimizing supply chains is crucial for organizations aiming to improve 
efficiency and maintain profitability. Supply chain optimization involves managing activities systematically to 
maximize performance and minimize costs while ensuring timely delivery of goods and services. This process 
addresses rising operational costs, heightened customer expectations, and environmental pressures, making effective 
supply chain management essential. Optimized supply chains help reduce waste, enhance resource utilization, and 
streamline processes, offering greater visibility and agility to adapt to market fluctuations. 
 
In this competitive environment, supply chain management, SCM, is very important., where responsiveness and cost-
effectiveness are key. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), a critical metric rooted in Total Productive","Proceedings of the 6th African International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

allowing facilities to formulate focused plans for minimizing downtime and improving operational flow. This 
proactive strategy not only reduces production losses but also enhances equipment use, therefore contributing to 
overall operational excellence. Moreover, our data demonstrates that the implementation of OEE has heightened 
awareness among management and personnel about performance metrics. Consequently, teams exhibit heightened 
engagement in continuous improvement projects, cultivating a culture of responsibility and operational advancement. 
The research indicates that firms using OEE have had quantifiable enhancements in production rates, with several 
entities claiming a rise in output without substantial capital expenditure. Moreover, quality enhancements have been 
recorded, since OEE facilitates the identification of process optimization opportunities, hence minimizing waste and 
deviations from product standards.  
 
The use of OEE improved operational performance and cultivated a culture of continuous improvement throughout 
the business. These findings highlight the significance of OEE as an essential instrument for enhancing productivity 
and 
efficiency 
in 
industrial 
environments.  
The study demonstrated that the use of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) significantly improved plant 
performance.  This study compared previous years data with new strategy of OEE implantation, identifying losses and 
implementing targeted changes, plants improved efficiency by 15%. They augmented production capacity by 20% at 
peak hours. Downtime was reduced by 30% via the documenting of both planned and unanticipated shutdowns. A 
25% decrease in scrap and rework rates resulted in quality enhancements. The OEE data empowered management to 
make informed decisions, leading to a more agile operational environment. Sustainability initiatives were guided by 
OEE research, leading to a 10% decrease in energy use. Our research focusing in Effect of Overall Equipment 
Effectiveness in the supply chain management exclude the external factors. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) statistic is an important indicator for corporate decision-making across a 
wide range of sectors. It evaluates the efficiency of manufacturing equipment, materials and financial assets. Logistics 
use it to examine environmental implications such as carbon footprints, and supply chains can use it to review cargo 
handling equipment. Both of these applications are possible. When it comes to the service industry, OEE is able to 
quantify the level of client satisfaction with the availability, performance, and quality of services. It is possible to 
illustrate an organization's total productivity by including an OEE-based model into a balanced scorecard. According 
to the findings of the study, overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) considerably improves plant performance by 
raising performance by 15%, increasing production capacity by 20%, lowering downtime by 30%, and decreasing 
scrap and rework rates, which ultimately results in a 10% decrease in energy consumption. Inventory optimization is 
undergoing a transformation as a result of the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 
Additionally, approaches such as demand forecasting and real-time inventory monitoring are being improved. OEE 
has grown to encompass lean manufacturing and supply chain efficiency, and its integration with technology belonging 
to Industry 4.0 allows real-time performance monitoring and fits with the objectives of smart manufacturing and 
logistics. Through the use of data-driven insights, the objective of the link between OEE and supply chain performance 
is to minimize interruptions, decrease costs, and increase delivery accuracy.

Abstract 
 
Road safety performance is influenced by various factors, including management strategies, infrastructure, human 
behaviors, regulations, and laws. Consequently, determining priority areas for intervention and selecting appropriate 
strategies and actions to enhance road network performance remains a complex challenge. This study adopts a 
performance evaluation approach to assess and compare the efficiency of different road safety systems, considering 
multiple factors. To achieve this, a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model is applied to measure the relative 
efficiency of  selected road safety entities based on multiple inputs and outputs. The main goals of this research are: 
(1) to evaluate and compare the efficiency of road safety entities, (2) to identify benchmarks based on the best-
performing entities, and (3) to determine the input adjustments needed to improve the efficiency of underperforming 
entities.

Abstract  
 
This paper examines how project management techniques can be utilised as strategic tools to enhance infrastructure 
projects more efficiently and effectively. It refers mainly to the Zama water treatment project in South Africa. This 
research illustrates the efficacy of PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique), CPM (Critical Path Method), 
and project crashing in resolving the region's water quality and infrastructure problems. The primary objective is to 
optimise the Zama water treatment project's planning, monitoring, and control to ensure project success. Information 
was collected from Hydro Novo Ltd in collaboration with the Municipal Chairperson of Utility Services. The data 
provided in the tables facilitated the development of the project management model following the fundamental 
principles of these approaches. The model was solved with the assistance of QM for Windows. The solution revealed 
that the project duration could be reduced from 78,6 weeks (completion time) to 57 weeks, costing R6,212,500 
additional. By crashing the project, the municipality ensures a quicker resolution to the water quality issues, 
significantly improving the social, economic, and quality of life conditions in the Zama community and supporting 
the stability and growth of local businesses. The sensitivity analysis suggests that reducing the project duration to 65 
or 60 weeks can be viable. It would save a lot of time at an acceptable cost and minimise risks while providing 
substantial benefits to the community. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how project management tools can 
enhance the success of infrastructure projects in resource-limited areas, ultimately contributing to sustainable water 
management in South Africa.

1. Introduction  
People in Zama, South Africa, continue to fight for access to clean and safe water (Njilo 2024). Despite numerous 
interventions that have been made to address the issue, water quality in the region continues to fall below acceptable 
health standards, compromising public health and social well-being (Infrastructure News 2025). This predicament is 
worsened by outdated infrastructure, constrained resources and difficulty implementing effective project management 
(SAnews 2024). Historically, poor project management has significantly contributed to infrastructure failures,","Proceedings of the 6thAfrican Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Rabat,

The sensitivity analysis shows the idea of diminishing returns because the average cost saved each week is more or less 
the same, ranging from R287,000 to R295,000. We need to take a closer look at the incremental cost of saving each extra 
week to see when it is no longer feasible to save more time. If the company wants to save funds and achieve good 
outcomes, reducing the project to 65 or 60 weeks would be preferable instead of hurrying and finishing it in 57 weeks, 
given the trade-off. In this manner, they can eliminate health and environmental risks and invest their funds appropriately. 
In deciding, the sponsors must determine whether it is within their budget and concomitant benefits to the community. 
Crashing minimises the suffering from the water crisis, but the extra cost of crashing must be affordable. If the project is 
not crashed, the normal period would have serious adverse effects, such as ongoing health threats, rising healthcare 
expenses, lost productivity, extended poor living conditions, environmental deterioration, and increased school and 
hospital absenteeism.  
 
The R6,212,500 extra spent on crashing the project would be far smaller than the damages and costs that might be 
incurred. The local businesses would experience difficulties ranging from increased absenteeism, inflated operating costs, 
supply chain disruption, diminished consumer spending, and discouraged investments. By crashing the project, the 
company provides a faster solution to the water quality problems, enhancing the social, economic, and quality of life 
status in the Zama community and facilitating the stability and growth of local enterprises. In addition, the sensitivity 
analysis suggests that a partial reduction of the project duration to 65 or 60 weeks can be a viable option. It would save a 
lot of time at an acceptable cost and minimise risks while providing substantial benefits to society. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The Zama water treatment project is a good example of applying project management tools to overcome challenging 
infrastructure issues. Using PERT, CPM, and project crashing, the project team determined the critical activities, 
improved resource utilisation, and shortened the project duration from 78,6 weeks to 57 weeks at an extra cost of R6 
212500. This method guarantees a timely supply of clean water to the Zama community and acts as a model for other 
communities facing similar challenges. Applying these methods proves that they can potentially make infrastructure 
work more efficiently. Finally, it advances people's quality of life and public health. 
 
Lesson Learned  
The Zama water treatment project highlights several key lessons. The project duration was reduced by implementing 
project management techniques from 78.6 weeks to 57 weeks, confirming that the methods can manage resources 
effectively. While reducing project duration, balancing time savings with cost implications is essential. The additional 
cost of R 6 212500 for crashing activities was justified by the significant reduction in project time, highlighting the need 
for careful cost-benefit analysis.Effective coordination with all the stakeholders involved, including the Municipal 
Chairperson of Utilities Services and the project company, was crucial in gathering accurate data and ensuring smooth 
project implementation. Successful stakeholder collaboration and communication were fundamental in overcoming 
logistical, financial, and operational challenges (Pinha & Ahluwalia 2018).  
 
The project faced different challenges, from approval bottlenecks to limited resources. However, navigating through 
these challenges using project management tools enabled efficient utilisation of project resources, including time for the 
project's success. In addition, the project helps realise the overall objective of sustainable water management in South 
Africa. In solving the recurring issue of water quality in Zama, the project can be a model for similar communities facing 
the same problem. Ensuring the availability of safe and clean water is a considerable contribution to the public's health 
and the well-being of society. The project's success in providing clean water to the Zama community highlights the 
importance of infrastructure projects in improving the quality of life for residents.","Proceedings of the 6thAfrican Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Rabat,

Abstract 
 
This paper explores the application of linear programming (LP) as a strategic tool for enhancing profitability in 
SMMEs, explicitly focusing on SA Petro, a South African Johannesburg startup. The primary objective is to optimise 
SA Petro's deployment of its delivery resources to maximise their profit. Data was collected from SA Petro through 
interviews with the organisation's CEO, including company records and synthesised into information tables that 
informed the formulation of the LP model. The LP model was solved using QM for Windows. According to the 
optimal solution, SA Petro should deliver 150,000 litres of diesel by truck, 120,000 litres by train, and the remaining 
730,000 litres by pipeline, yielding a projected profit of R555,000. Reviewing the sensitivity analysis, since all the 
logistics resources are still surplus at the given production level, the optimal strategy for SA Petro would be to accept 
more orders up to a feasible upper limit of 1,270,000 litres. This increase will enable the company to deploy the unused 
logistic resources. The study yields meaningful insights into the combination of product distribution options that will 
optimise operations for SA Petro.

Introduction 
Business process optimisation is crucial for an organisation to remain sustainable; it speaks not only to business 
survival but also to other facets of sustainability, such as environmental and social impact. Linear programming is one 
of several tools used for process optimisation. This tool, however, is handy because of its characteristics. A linear 
program has an objective function depicting what is desired, with constraints on the available resources, including the 
operating environment and defining decision variables. These characteristics speak to the general format of 
optimisation problems faced in any organisation (Nwobodo-Anyadiegwu 2023). Businesses, irrespective of whether 
it is manufacturing or service industry, usually have an objective such as maximising profits or minimising costs, and 
they need to figure out how to do that subject to the limitations found in their specific context (Syifa et al. 2023; 
Nwobodo-Anyadiegwu  2023).","Proceedings of the 6th African Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Rabat,

Limitations 
The data for this study was obtained via interviews and company records. The interviews exposed the study to 
subjectivity, which may impair data accuracy. The study also assumes that the market environment is constant without 
considering the effect on market conditions or cost. A fuzzy goal LP or a stochastic LP is recommended for further 
studies. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study shows the practical application of linear programming as an effective economic decision-making tool for 
process optimisation in SMMEs like SA Petro. Evidently, with more operational constraints and decision variables, 
an optimal production mix can be obtained at any time by applying the techniques used in this study. By optimising 
delivery resource allocation through the LP model, SA Petro can maximise profits while meeting operational 
constraints. The solutions produced by QM for Windows software indicate that SA Petro should deliver 150 000 litres 
via trucks, 120 000 litres by train and 730 000 litres through the pipelines. This will result in a profit of R555 000 for

Abstract 
 
The integration of graphene into Ti-6Al-4V alloys via Selective Laser Melting (SLM) presents a promising pathway 
to enhance the mechanical and functional properties of metal matrix composites. However, achieving uniform 
dispersion remains a challenge due to graphene agglomeration in the base material. This study introduces an 
Agglomeration Factor (AF) as a quantitative metric to assess graphene clustering as a result of variation in laser power 
during the SLM process. In this study, a hybrid methodology is used, which combines Multiscale Multiphysics 
Simulation Modeling (MMSM) using Ansys, with experimental validation through SEM-based image analysis. Five 
specimens were simulated and fabricated using laser powers of 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 W, respectively, while 
maintaining all other process parameters, including scanning speed and powder bed temperature, constant. Results 
demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between laser power and AF in both experimental and simulated 
environments, with the lowest AF observed at 400 W, which indicates optimal dispersion. While the highest AF was 
observed at 200 W. This demonstrates that an increase in laser power, translates in improved graphene dispersion in 
the Ti-6Al-4V matrix. Furthermore, it was observed that the MMSM’s predictive accuracy deviates from 
experimentation by 5.71%. This study establishes AF as a reliable dispersion metric and demonstrates the critical role 
of laser power in mitigating graphene clustering. This study provides a framework for optimizing SLM-based 
nanocomposite fabrication.

Introduction 
The integration of graphene into titanium alloys, particularly the widely used Ti-6Al-4V alloy, offers a promising 
pathway toward the development of next-generation materials for high-performance applications. Ti-6Al-4V provides 
enhanced mechanical properties, including high strength, low weight, and biocompatibility, making it ideal for 
industries such as aerospace, medical implants, and automotive (Pegues et al. 2016). When combined with graphene, 
a material with high tensile strength (~130 GPa) as well as high electrical and thermal conductivity, the resulting 
composite indicates significant enhancements in wear resistance, fatigue strength, and overall structural integrity. This 
combination can revolutionize applications requiring high performance and lightweight structures under extreme 
conditions (Sun et al. 2021).

Abstract 
 
This paper investigates score-based and constraint-based causal discovery methods, emphasizing their application to 
manufacturing processes. The research focuses on how algorithms such as the PC (Peter and Clark) and FGES (Fast 
Greedy Equivalence Search) can uncover causal relationships within complex manufacturing systems, which are 
essential for process optimization, fault detection, and informed decision-making.The study was done in three key 
phases. First, a thorough literature review established the theoretical foundation for understanding causal discovery 
methods. These methods were applied to real-world manufacturing data in the second phase, focusing on assembly 
lines and production processes. The main goal was to find key variables impacting production efficiency, product 
quality, and equipment failure rates. In the final phase, the performance of the causal discovery algorithms was 
evaluated through regression analyses, where R-squared values measured how well the identified causal relationships 
explained observed outcomes. The results revealed that the PC algorithm can identify direct and indirect relationships 
among variables. Also, the FGES algorithm proved more effective at uncovering complex interactions in high-
dimensional datasets.This study suggests that causal discovery techniques can be integrated into automated decision-
support systems within manufacturing. Organizations can refine existing systems, optimize operations, and develop 
predictive models for proactive issue management by better understanding the causal structure of production 
processes. Future research should expand the application of causal discovery methods across a broader range of 
manufacturing environments.

1. Introduction 
The technical advancements in sensors, equipment, and instrumentation over the past few years have resulted in a 
steady evolution of industrial process monitoring strategies. Modern plant-wide performance monitoring systems can 
examine many measurable variables simultaneously as these complicated industrial processes can generate a lot of 
information (Jiang et al., 2019; Yuan et al. 2017). 
 
In the modern era, to understand industrial systems' complicated dynamics, there is a need to develop/implement 
precise and reliable causal models for aberrant event detection, monitoring, performance evaluation, and maintenance 
of the machine unit/processes. Causality analysis helps to add information to the already existing knowledge base. 
The purpose of using causality analysis in manufacturing is to learn more about the production process and improve 
decision-making based on actionable information. In several instances, data-driven causality analysis techniques used 
in engineering settings have difficulty modeling controller interactions, considering temporal data, and identifying the 
sequential relationships between events that affect process performance (Nadim et al., 2022). Therefore, this work 
aims to demonstrate how various causal discovery algorithms can be utilized to understand manufacturing operations","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of score-based (FGES) and constraint-based (PC) causal discovery 
algorithms in uncovering causal relationships within manufacturing processes, a tool not widely recognized in this 
domain. The research demonstrated that these algorithms could effectively identify the causal structure between 
variables, ultimately improving the understanding of key dependencies that drive production efficiency, product 
quality, and equipment failure rates. By evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of the PC and FGES algorithms, 
this work contributes to determining the best-suited approach for modeling complex, high-dimensional datasets typical 
of manufacturing environments. These findings suggest that causal discovery can enhance decision-making in 
industrial systems by providing clearer insights into how different factors influence outcomes, enabling more accurate 
predictions and proactive fault detection. 
 
The application of causal discovery models, particularly those based on the PC and FGES algorithms, opens up new 
opportunities for refining manufacturing operations. While previous studies have not explored the use of these models 
to estimate heterogeneous causal effects in manufacturing, this research fills that gap and offers a foundational 
framework for future investigations. By demonstrating the potential for causal analysis in industrial settings, the study 
advocates for the integration of causal discovery techniques into automated decision-support systems. This integration 
can optimize operations, improve predictive modeling, and help organizations better manage issues before they 
escalate. Looking ahead, further research can expand the application of these methods across various manufacturing 
sectors, providing deeper insights into process improvements and advancing data-driven decision-making.

Hierarchical Forecasting for Vehicle Sales: An Evaluation  
of Nixtla's Framework 
 
Aishwary Pawar

pawara@umich.edu 
 
Abstract 
 
Hierarchical forecasting is important for predicting sales across multiple aggregation levels, particularly in industries 
like automotive, where forecasting at various granularities—from individual vehicles to regional sales—is critical for 
decision-making. This study applies Nixtla’s open-source hierarchical forecasting framework to a vehicle sales dataset 
containing approximately 12,000 data points. The research is organized into two phases to evaluate different 
reconciliation methods and their effectiveness in improving forecast accuracy across hierarchical levels.Phase 1 of 
the study involves applying four reconciliation techniques: top-down, bottom-up, MinTrace MinShrink, and MinTrace 
OLS. The above methods are assessed based on their ability to reconcile forecasts across multiple levels, from total 
sales to individual vehicle categories, and their impact on overall forecasting accuracy.  
 
In Phase 2, we rigorously evaluate the performance of these methods by calculating and comparing scaled mean 
squared error (scaled-MSE) at each hierarchical level, from high-level aggregations to granular sales forecasts.The 
results show that forecast accuracy remains consistently high at the first two levels of aggregation, with a scaled MSE 
below 1. However, as the hierarchy levels increase and forecasts become more granular, the scaled MSE increases 
significantly, indicating difficulties in maintaining accuracy at lower hierarchical levels. Among the methods tested, 
MinTrace OLS stands out as the most effective technique, achieving the best predictive performance and minimizing 
error propagation at more profound levels of the hierarchy. This suggests that MinTrace OLS can better handle the 
complexities of hierarchical forecasting than the other methods.These findings highlight the importance of selecting 
appropriate reconciliation techniques for hierarchical forecasting and emphasize the challenges in maintaining forecast 
accuracy at finer granularities. The study also points to the need for further research into advanced reconciliation 
methods to address these challenges and improve forecast precision at all hierarchy levels.

Abstract 
 
Even though the developing countries are facing financial and economic crisis today, the future poses yet still 
enormous challenges. Growing population, energy consumption, climate change, environmental pollution, 
deterioration of natural resources, globalization of production networks, multiple cases of violation of human rights 
in developing countries, and fierce competition in the business community, are just a few examples of the problems 
facing our societies today and putting at risk the prospects of development of potential future generations of which 
Sierra Leone is no exception. Supply chain management (SCM) has become a potentially significant way to enhancing 
competitive advantage and improving organizational performance since competition is no longer between 
organizations, but among supply chains. This paper conceptualizes and develops four resiliency practices, which 
involve (flexibility, redundancy, collaboration and agility), and tests the relationships between organizations’ financial 
performance and competitive advantage in the retail supply chain management in Sierra Leone. The study used 
stratified random sampling to pick a sample size of 95 retailing outlets in the capital city of Sierra Leone - Freetown, 
which represent different retailing vendors. The respondents were mainly of managers of different retailing vendors. 
The relationships proposed in the conceptual framework were tested using correlation analysis. The results indicate 
that higher levels of resilience practices in retailing vendors can lead to enhanced competitive advantage and improved 
financial performance. In addition, competitive advantage has a direct positive impact on organizational performance. 
 
Keywords: retailing, supply chain management (SCM), resiliency practices, organizational performance,

Introduction 
In today’s competitive business environment, supply chain should efficiently  and effectively integrate suppliers, 
manufacturers, warehouses, and stores so that merchandise is produced and distributed at the right quantities, to the 
right locations, and at the right time (Simatupang and Sridharan 2018). Supply chain disruptions can be very severe 
to enhancing robust retail supply chains. This complicates working business environment and hence calling for 
resiliency practices like flexibility, collaboration, redundancy and agility in global operations of retail supply chains. 
(Sheffi 2005) asserted that the growing complexity of managing global supply chains and meeting intensifying 
customer requirements has made organizations more aware of their operational and economic vulnerability to threats 
from the global environment. Supply chain resilience can help to reduce and overcome exposure to risks through 
developing strategies that enable the supply chain to recover to its original functional state following a disruption",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

As shown in figure 2 above competitive advantage has a significantly positive correlation on a retail’s financial 
performance (0.01211; p< 0.05). Thus, H1 supported. The correlation coefficient between flexibility and financial 
performance is not statistically significant (0.1480; p> 0.05) thus, the null hypothesis H2a rejected. However, the 
correlation coefficient from flexibility to competitive advantage is significant, in this case the null hypothesis is 
accepted (0.0119 p<0.05). Thus, supply chains with high level of flexibility   exhibit a lower level of financial 
performance and a higher level of competitive advantage. Likewise, H3a the correlation coefficient from redundancy 
to a company financial performance is significant thus, the null hypothesis is accepted (0.0339; p <0.05) .However, 
H3b the correlation coefficient from redundancy to competitive advantage is not significant, thus the null hypothesis 
is rejected (0.1167; p> 0.05).  
 
Supply chain collaboration has significantly positive correlation to both financial performance (0.0007; p<0.05) and 
competitive advantage (0.0081; p<0.05) of a retail supply chain. Thus, supply chains with high collaboration   exhibit 
high level of financial performance and competitive advantage. Hence, both H4a and H4b supported. Finally, the 
correlation between supply chain agility to that of financial performance H5a is not significant (0.0910; p >0.05), and 
the correlation coefficient from supply chain agility to competitive advantage is found to be significant H5b (0.0282; 
p<0.05). Thus, supply chains with high level of agility found to exhibit a low level of financial performance and high 
level of competitive advantage. Hence, H5a rejected and H5b supported. The summary of the hypotheses is shown in 
Table 5 below.

Abstract 
 
The increasing complexity of modern technological and industrial systems presents significant challenges in 
anticipating the impact of new innovations within existing ecosystems. The interaction between humans and machines 
generates emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict, potentially leading to unintended consequences affecting 
economic structures, environmental sustainability, and operational efficiency. This study explores the integration of 
agentic artificial intelligence and Business Intelligence to enhance decision-making in the smart industry. AI agents, 
designed with autonomous reasoning and adaptive capabilities, facilitate proactive issue detection and strategic 
reporting. By leveraging the principles of agentic flow, this approach enables continuous and context-aware 
adjustments to industrial processes, optimizing resource allocation and system efficiency. Through real-time data 
processing and adaptive decision-making, the proposed framework improves predictive accuracy by dynamically 
integrating sensor data, operational feedback, and evolving industrial conditions. This enhances strategic planning, 
ensuring greater flexibility and resilience in production and supply chain management. Moreover, by incorporating 
human oversight, the system refines its recommendations over time, supporting more precise and informed decision-
making in complex industrial environments.

Abstract  
 
In the era of Industry X.0, defect prediction and product quality management have become critical issues for 
optimizing costs, reducing waste, and improving the efficiency of production chains. Integrating advanced 
technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Distributed ledger technologies (DLT), and the Internet of Things 
(IoT) offers a unique opportunity to transform these processes, enabling real-time monitoring, proactive decision-
making, and full traceability. Agentic AI is a breakthrough in artificial intelligence where autonomous agents become 
the key players in intelligent systems. These agents, empowered with the ability to perceive their environment, make 
informed decisions and act independently, are pushing back the limits of traditional automation and traditional AI 
systems, which are often centralised and reactive. This paper proposes an innovative architecture that combines agentic 
AI, Hashgraph DLT, and IoT to quality control in production time and ensure optimal product quality management in 
the context of a smart factory. By exploiting the power of intelligent agents for data analysis and prediction, in addition 
of Hashgraph for information security and transparency, this solution aims to improve industrial performance by 
reducing the risks and costs associated with production defects. A scalable and adaptable approach that opens the way 
to a new era in industrial quality management.

Abstract 
India's rapid economic growth has led to an increasing demand for energy, making sustainable energy solutions 
crucial. The logistics sector, which accounts for a significant portion of India's GDP, faces challenges in reducing 
costs and carbon emissions. Currently, logistics costs are high, and the transportation sector contributes 
substantially to CO2 emissions. To address these issues, India aims to reduce logistics costs and achieve net-zero 
emissions. This study explores how India integrates green hydrogen into its logistics infrastructure to create a 
more sustainable and efficient system. It examines the challenges in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
logistics costs, with a focus on optimizing green hydrogen-based logistics. 
The research uses a descriptive approach, analysing data from secondary sources such as the Open Government 
Data platform and reports related to India's green hydrogen mission. Furthermore, some international reports and 
research studies were also analysed to identify the current situation of transitioning in Indian logistics. The study 
assesses the current infrastructure and its limitations, laying the groundwork for future research on optimized and 
green hydrogen-based multimodal logistics. Moreover, the study identifies key challenges and critical factors 
affecting the adoption of green hydrogen in logistics. It highlights the need for robust transportation systems and 
optimized regional networks using clean fuels like green hydrogen. This research provides a conceptual 
framework for developing sustainable green hydrogen-based logistics in India. It offers insights for researchers 
and academics to create mathematical models using AI/ML to optimize green hydrogen logistics costs and 
efficiency.  By focusing on the implementation of green hydrogen in the Indian logistics system, India can achieve 
its net-zero 2070 and SGD goals simultaneously.  India can potentially reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, lower 
emissions, and enhance its economic growth sustainably.

Introduction:  
Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have reached unprecedented levels, with annual carbon dioxide (CO₂) 
outputs consistently hitting new highs, as highlighted in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) & Emissions 
Gap Report 2023 (- International Energy Agency 2023). India now ranks as the world’s third-largest emitter of 
GHGs, following China and the United States, according to recent data from Statista (2025). The statistics clearly 
attribute the majority of these emissions to the continued and overwhelming reliance on fossil fuels, a trend that 
is visually depicted in Figure 1, which shows the persistent growth in global fossil fuel emissions. Despite 
mounting evidence of their environmental impact, fossil fuels remain the cornerstone of the global energy system,","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Figure 6.  Benefits of introducing Green Hydrogen energy in the logistics sector 
 
Conclusion:  
India’s logistics sector currently faces significant challenges, with logistics costs accounting for 13–14% of the 
country’s GDP, much higher than the global average of 8–9%. Freight transport remains essential for economic 
growth, business development, and improving quality of life, but it is also a major contributor to CO₂ emissions. 
While railways offer more cost-effective logistics options, road transport continues to dominate both freight and 
passenger movement, leading to higher expenses and environmental concerns.  
 
Introducing green hydrogen into India’s logistics sector could bring a range of benefits, including environmental 
improvements, economic growth, and positive social impacts. Green hydrogen has the potential to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and lower dependence on imported fossil fuels, while also supporting India’s broader 
goals of reducing logistics costs to 5% of GDP and achieving some Sustainable Development Goals, as well as 
net-zero emissions by 2070. Building a green hydrogen ecosystem supported by modern infrastructure and strong 
public-private partnerships can help India overcome financial losses in state transport units, attract global 
investment, and establish itself as a leader in sustainable logistics.

However, several challenges must be addressed to implement green hydrogen in logistics successfully. These 
include weather uncertainties, the need for skilled labor, technological advancements, behavioral barriers, funding 
constraints, infrastructure gaps, high initial costs, and regulatory and policy hurdles, such as:   
 
Fluctuations in renewable energy supply due to weather conditions can impact hydrogen production. 
Green hydrogen remains expensive compared to other fuel alternatives. 
Building hydrogen-related infrastructure in densely populated urban areas is complex. 
There are no clear guidelines or policies regarding green hydrogen infrastructure development. 
Storage and transportation of hydrogen pose safety risks. 
Societal reluctance to adopt new technologies adds another layer of difficulty. 
 
In the future, there is a need to create strong policies and clear rules for producing, storing, and using green 
hydrogen. Apart from that, raising public awareness is also a critical step so that more people support green 
hydrogen technologies. The study also suggests that by working collaboratively, the government, research 
institutes, and private companies can speed up building the necessary technologies & infrastructure. Finally, the 
study suggests connecting green hydrogen with other renewable energy sources to make sure the supply remains 
steady and reliable.This study provides valuable insights for researchers and academics interested in road logistics 
and the development of green hydrogen-based multimodal transport networks. It highlights the importance of 
identifying key factors for optimizing logistics costs and efficiency, as well as the main challenges facing the 
sector. Future research can build on these findings by developing mathematical models to further enhance the 
performance and sustainability of India’s logistics industry.

Abstract  
 
Improving robotic assembly line balancing (RALBP) is key to increasing productivity, reducing cycle time (CT), and 
lowering energy consumption (EN). This study highlights the importance of optimizing robot deployment and 
workstation configuration to balance both objectives. A dual-objective model using a weighted sum approach 
evaluates different CT-to-EN priority ratios. Experiments across three problem sizes analyze the impact of station 
count and robot selection on CT, EN, and line efficiency. Results show that prioritizing CT increases energy use, while 
energy-focused configurations extend CT but enhance sustainability. ANOVA showed that robots count has a strong 
impact on efficiency in terms of WEST ratio, while adding more stations does not necessarily improve efficiency. The 
interaction effect (Robots × Stations) is insignificant as the two factors work independently rather than together. This 
research also introduces a benchmark dataset to support future studies in sustainable manufacturing.

7.Conclusion  
This study aims to optimize robotic assembly line balancing (RALBP) by analyzing the impact of different cycle time 
(CT) and energy consumption (EN) ratios across task complexities of 11, 25, and 35 tasks. The research investigates 
how varying the number of robots and stations affects performance efficiency under three different CT: EN priority 
ratios: 1:0 (cycle time prioritization), 0.5:0.5 (balanced optimization), and 0:1 (energy prioritization). A mathematical 
model was developed to simulate and optimize task allocation under these conditions, ensuring a trade-off between 
productivity and sustainability. The experimental design involved varying the number of robots (1 to 12) and stations 
(3 to 12), while conducting simulations to measure cycle time and energy consumption across different configurations.  
The results show that the optimization of robotic assembly lines is a delicate balancing act. While increasing resources 
improves performance, diminishing returns and energy trade-offs necessitate context-aware strategies. Stations 
mitigate sequential bottlenecks but risk inefficiency if overused. Larger problems necessitate proportional scaling of 
both resources to avoid performance collapse. Problem Size Dictates Optimization Strategy such that for small tasks 
(11–25 tasks) prioritize simplicity, as minimal robots/stations suffice, while for large tasks (35+ tasks) demand 
aggressive resource allocation to balance CT and EN.  
 
Finally, the optimization of robotic assembly lines is a delicate balancing act. While increasing resources improves 
performance, diminishing returns and energy trade-offs necessitate context-aware strategies. For large-scale systems, 
a hybrid approach—leveraging parallelization for CT reduction while monitoring energy thresholds offers the most 
sustainable path forward. By aligning resource allocation with operational priorities, manufacturers can achieve both 
efficiency and sustainability in an era of increasingly complex automation.From ANOVA analysis, it is found that 
robots have a strong impact on efficiency, as shown by both ANOVA and box plots. Stations do not significantly 
affect the WEST ratio, meaning adding more stations does not necessarily improve efficiency. The interaction effect 
(Robots × Stations) is insignificant, meaning these two factors work independently rather than together.

Abstract 
 
Inventory management is a key part of any successful business. One of the most important elements that can affect 
inventory accuracy is stock counting. An excellent stock counting process means high efficiency and high financial 
gain as well. Further, using sustainable and technological methods for the process of counting stocks is essential, since 
it reduces waste and negative impact on the environment. Mistakes and errors in inventory management can lead to 
lower customer satisfaction and higher expenses. This paper aims to compare technological alternatives with 
conventional stock counting processes by employing a multi-method approach. A thorough literature review was 
conducted to gain a theoretical understanding of the process and key aspects associated with it. Following this, to 
support the findings from research papers, a questionnaire was provided to participants from major companies in Saudi 
Arabia. After that, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which is a multi-
criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, was utilized to select the best alternative. Findings show that the drone-
based system is the most beneficial solution for stock counting. It also indicated wide-ranging advantages of the 
technological techniques of stock counting and the need for stakeholders to comprehend the benefits of these 
approaches to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Lastly, utilizing efficient stock counting methods can lead to 
better inventory management.

1. Introduction  
Nowadays, effective inventory management is important for any successful organization. One of the main processes 
of warehouse operations and inventory control is stock counting. It holds importance as it involves keeping records 
and monitoring all items. Stock counting helps ensure reliability and financial statements, as a company tracks 
inventory levels of goods. However, despite the rise of automated options for inventory management and stock 
counting, many organizations still rely on traditional approaches. Conventional stock counting techniques encounter 
many difficulties such as discrepancies and errors which hold major risks in the overall financial aspects of the","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Figure 6 presents a bar graph displaying the ranked alternatives. The drone method stands as the most efficient one 
because it operates at high speed and achieves precise results. The barcode system ranks second because it provides 
reliable results, although it operates at a lower level of sophistication. The third position goes to RFID technology 
which provides real-time tracking yet encounters obstacles related to cost and system complexity. The phone app 
holds the fourth position, which implies its efficiency level is lower than the top methods. Lastly, the manual method 
receives the lowest ranking because it demonstrates both inefficiency and error-prone operations, thus showing why 
advanced inventory management technologies should be adopted.  
 
Overall, findings from the survey provide valuable insights into current stock counting practices among various sizes 
of organizations’ warehouses in Saudi Arabia. The results indicate that a significant majority of participants rely on 
manual stock counting methods. Within technological methods, barcode scanning is the most popular choice, 
demonstrating its efficiency, while other advanced technologies like RFID and drones remain largely unused. The 
responses also highlight that companies with manual stock counting methods are facing problems with accurate 
results, which suggests that technological methods are important for more efficient and accurate inventory 
management systems. Moreover, most participants indicated that errors in the stock counting process can lead to both 
minor and significant financial losses. Therefore, alternative solutions are favored to mitigate the negative impacts of 
these errors and discrepancies. A range of technological methods is available for stock counting. Hence, the TOPSIS 
method was utilized to identify the optimal solution based on multiple criteria. The results revealed that drones are the 
most effective option, likely due to their demonstrated superior accuracy in various research studies. At the same time, 
barcode scanning is preferred in general-use cases for its balance of speed, accuracy, and affordability. RFID 
technology is favored in high-tech environments where both speed and precision are crucial, whereas drones excel in 
large warehouses that require rapid scanning capabilities. Additionally, phone-based counting is a popular choice 
among small businesses, prioritizing less time and ease of use, but not high accuracy. However, manual counting is 
the least preferred method to be selected, except when the cost is the primary concern.  
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, stock counting is the process of physically counting the actual items in the company's warehouse to 
ensure that records are accurate. This paper analyzed and compared technological alternatives with traditional stock 
counting methods using a multi-method approach. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to establish a 
theoretical framework for understanding the process and its key components. Following this, a questionnaire was 
administered to participants from major companies in Saudi Arabia to validate the findings from existing research. 
The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a method for multi-criteria decision-
making (MCDM), was employed to identify the optimal alternative. The results indicated that the drone-based system

was the most advantageous solution for stock counting. Additionally, it was found that manual stock counting is still 
dominant in Saudi Arabian Businesses, while barcode scanning is the most popular technological solution used. Also, 
companies face minor and major financial losses due to errors resulting from the stock counting process. Finally, 
adopting effective stock counting methods contributed to improved inventory management. These methods reduce 
waste, paper use, and resource misuse, which not only streamline operations but also support sustainability

Abstract  
 
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face increasing challenges in sustaining their operations in today's highly 
competitive business environment. To keep up with evolving technologies and maintain their activities under 
competitive pressure, they should implement the requirements of digital transformation. In this study, a Strengths, 
Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted on digital transformation, focusing on SMEs in 
Turkey. The reason for selecting this sample is that the vast majority of businesses operating in Turkey are SMEs. The 
current situation was identified through the SWOT analysis. The factors obtained from the SWOT analysis were then 
weighted using the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) technique, one of the multi-criteria 
decision-making methods. Among all the sub-factors ranked according to their weights, the top five sub-factors with 
the highest weights have been identified. As a result of the purposed integrated model, it has been determined that the 
following factors play a critical role in the digital transformation of SMEs: Threat of Economic Fluctuations, 
Weakness of Financial Resource Constraints, Threat of Cybersecurity Risks, Opportunity of Industry 4.0 and Smart 
Manufacturing Systems, and Strength of a Young and Tech-Savvy Workforce. For these sub-factors, strategies have 
been developed to prioritize and enhance the areas that require focus. The study concluded that it was determined that 
implementing strategies such as developing new models to seek financial resources to eliminate transformation risks, 
preparing support programs to mitigate cybersecurity risks, creating incentive programs for transitioning to smart 
manufacturing models, and establishing various training programs to increase digital awareness would contribute 
significantly to the transformation process of SMEs.

support mechanisms, such as investment funds tailored to the needs of SMEs, leasing models, and fintech-supported 
credit mechanisms. 
 
•Strengthening Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Increasing Awareness of Preventive Measures: To enable SMEs to 
continue their operations by closing data security gaps, complying with regulations, and increasing customer trust, it 
is necessary to identify cybersecurity threats and take preventive measures. This can be achieved by preparing 
guidelines and regulatory compliance programs, conducting cybersecurity attack simulations, strengthening 
infrastructure, and providing consultancy support related to the Personal Data Protection Law (KVKK). 
 
Transition to Smart Production Models with Industry 4.0 and IoT Support: To provide a global competitive advantage, 
increase business efficiency, and enable operations at lower costs, incentives should be provided for automation, AI-
supported systems, and IoT-based production technologies. 
 
Digital Workforce Development and Employment Enhancement Programs: To help SMEs find the necessary human 
resources for DT and address the skills gap, vocational training programs and industry-university collaborations 
should be established to develop a workforce with digital skills, considering the needs of SMEs. Additionally, young 
workforce entering the workforce should be encouraged to participate in these programs. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The rapid advancement of technology is propelling businesses of all sizes toward DT. Given the significant role of 
SMEs in the Turkish economy, a SWOT analysis on DT in SMEs was conducted with input from experts to identify 
key influencing factors. To prioritize these factors based on their importance, the SWARA method was applied. The 
resulting factor weights aim to highlight priority areas that require strategic focus. 
 
The SWARA-based analysis reveals that the threat of economic fluctuations, the weakness of financial resource 
constraints, the threat of cybersecurity risks, the opportunity offered by Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing systems, 
and the strength of a young, tech-savvy workforce are critical elements in the DT journey of SMEs. These findings 
indicate that SMEs must be prepared to manage economic volatility, overcome financial limitations, mitigate 
cybersecurity risks, and capitalize on the opportunities provided by Industry 4.0 technologies and a digitally competent 
workforce. 
 
By utilizing the SWARA-based prioritization, this study aims to offer Turkish SMEs a strategic roadmap that 
emphasizes the most critical areas of focus. Accordingly, targeted strategies have been proposed to effectively address 
and manage the impacts of the five most highly weighted factors.

Abstract  
 
Accurate solar irradiance forecasting is pivotal for the effective integration of photovoltaic systems into modern power 
grids. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to more advanced models capable of capturing the highly 
nonlinear and time-dependent patterns. In this work, we compare the performance of several state of the art and 
emerging AI architectures for short-term time series predictions in the context of global horizontal irradiance 
forecasting. A comprehensive dataset comprising historical ground-based irradiance and weather measurements is 
employed to train and validate the models. Evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error and root mean square 
error, are utilized for models’ performance evaluation. Furthermore, an assessment of the model’s robustness under 
varying meteorological conditions will be conducted. The findings provide a benchmark for comparing these models, 
depicting their respective strengths and limitations subsequently advancing the data-driven solar irradiance 
forecasting.

Abstract  
 
Accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power generation is crucial for optimizing energy management and 
enhancing grid stability. While hybrid models combining Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) with deep learning 
techniques and electrical models have shown promising results, improving their forecasting accuracy remains 
a key challenge. This study investigates the use of hybrid forecasting models for PV power prediction, focusing on 
the integration of WRF-Solar outputs with machine learning approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
and electrical models. The study evaluates model performance over a 24-hour forecast horizon using standard metrics, 
including mean absolute error and root mean square error. The results highlight the balance between prediction 
accuracy and model efficiency, providing insights into the effectiveness of combining numerical weather predictions 
with machine learning approaches for improving PV power prediction systems.

Practical AI Benchmark: Evaluating Integrated Reasoning, 
Multimodal Analysis, and Tool Use in Industrial Contexts 
 
Zakaria Zaza*,**, Omar Souissi*

Abstract 
 
Artificial intelligence (AI) have rapidly evolved from stand-alone text-only large language models (LLMs) into multi-
capable agents with integrated reasoning, tool use, and multimodal abilities (e.g., GPT-4, Grok, Google Gemini). 
These advanced systems promise to tackle complex real-world tasks, but evaluating their performance in practical 
industrial scenarios remains challenging. Existing benchmarks such as GAIA [1], BFCL [2], and MageBench [3] 
each focus on a subset of required skills (general question-answering, function calling, or multimodal reasoning) and 
do not reflect the integrated challenges of industrial applications. To address this gap, we present the PracticalAI 
Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite for AI systems in realistic industrial environments. PracticalAI tasks 
demand a combination of capabilities: multi-step logical reasoning for problem-solving, tool usage via API calls to 
interact with simulated sensors and actuators, processing of image and video inputs, and web search integration to 
verify real-time technical data. Unlike traditional evaluations that emphasize response correctness, PracticalAI 
prioritizes execution accuracy – measuring whether an AI agent can autonomously execute the correct sequence of 
tool calls to accomplish each task. All tasks run in high-fidelity simulated industrial environments, ensuring safe yet 
realistic testing of an agent’s ability to plan and act autonomously. Although developed for industrial engineering use 
cases (e.g., manufacturing processes), the PracticalAI framework is broadly applicable to other domains requiring 
autonomous agents, including IT operations, software system management, and logistics.

Abstract 
 
Logistics 4.0 is a rapidly evolving sector that is driven by digital transformation. Warehouses, as a central component 
of logistics operations, are at the forefront of this revolution, which necessitates advanced technologies to optimize 
processes, automate operations, reduce costs, avoid errors and enhance efficiency. This level of smartness can be 
achieved through the integration of Artificial Intelligence solutions, with computer vision (CV) playing a pivotal role 
in enabling these advancements. CV offers a range of solutions including object recognition and tracking, inventory 
management, quality inspection, and robotic navigation. This short survey provides a comprehensive overview of 
recent applications of CV in smart warehouses, categorizing findings by their application fields. Several studies 
demonstrate the deployment of edge AI cameras, drones, and robotic systems equipped with CV techniques such as 
image processing, deep learning-based architectures (e.g., YOLO variants, Faster R-CNN, Large Vision Models), and 
SLAM-based navigation. The paper highlights CV’s transformative role in addressing smart warehouses challenges 
and serves as a foundation for exploring recent advancements of CV to developing next-generation AI-driven smart 
warehouses, pushing the boundaries of efficiency and paving the way for future advancements in logistics automation.

Abstract 
 
Goal Programming (GP) is perhaps the most widely used multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique that 
addresses complex decision problems involving multiple, conflicting objectives. However, GP has inherent 
limitations, particularly in handling subjective preferences and trade-offs decision criteria. This paper proposes a 
hybrid approach, combining Goal Programming (GP) with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Analytic 
Network Process (ANP) to overcome these limitations. The integration of AHP and ANP with GP allows for better 
prioritization of decision criteria and trade-offs among them. The main contribution of this paper is to propose this 
unique AHP-ANP-GP methodology as a robust solution to multi-objective decision problems, enhancing decision-
making accuracy and flexibility. Finally, the paper demonstrates the application of the proposed model to an important 
Supply Chain Management (SCM) problem: optimizing the trade-off between transportation and inventory costs.

Introduction 
Decision-making in complex environments, where multiple objectives and constraints must be simultaneously 
addressed, poses significant challenges for decision-makers. Goal Programming (GP) has proven to be a powerful 
multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool for tackling such problems. By optimizing a set of predefined goals 
while satisfying various constraints, GP allows decision-makers to find optimal solutions in scenarios involving 
conflicting objectives. However, while GP excels in handling quantitative goals and constraints, it faces notable 
limitations when it comes to dealing with subjective preferences and interdependencies between decision criteria.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

category.  Thus, the constraints, among other constraints, should include a series of constraints for transportation and 
other series for inventory. 
 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper has proposed a hybrid approach combining Goal Programming, AHP, and ANP to address the limitations 
of GP in multi-criteria decision-making. By incorporating AHP and ANP, we can model interdependencies between 
decision criteria, providing a more robust and flexible decision-making framework. The paper illustrates the 
application of this hybrid methodology through a typical SCM problem, balancing transportation and inventory costs. 
The future work should use numerical example to show that this integrated approach offers an effective solution to 
complex, multi-objective problems. 
Future research could explore further applications of the hybrid GP-AHP-ANP approach in other industries, such as 
energy management, healthcare, and finance, to enhance decision-making under uncertainty and interdependency.

Abstract 
The proposed study presents a novel hybrid tool that integrates virtual and real environments to evaluate seat comfort, 
focusing on contact pressure, joint angles, and overall body posture. It addresses the research question of how 
such a hybrid approach can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seat comfort assessments compared to traditional 
methods that often rely on subjective feedback and neglect sitting posture comfort. The proposed tool employs 
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for human mannequins and seat designs, using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to 
measure contact pressure and human factors simulation software for posture and joint angle analysis. Validation 
involves pressure mapping and motion capture systems in real-world settings, while an Analytical Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) determines optimal sitting configurations. This integrated approach offers a comprehensive assessment 
framework of seat comfort to evaluate various postures and assess comfort levels across different seat designs.

1.Introduction 
The evolution of technology and dependence on computers keeps enforcing sedentary lifestyles more than ever. Such 
modern advancements introduced a wide variety of activities that can be performed whether working in offices, 
telecom- muting, using public transportation, or traveling. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), 
sedentary jobs have increased by 83% since 1950, and a normal office worker sits a shocking 15 hours every 
single day, and even more for people who undergo long commutes. This alludes to the fact that people spend most of 
their day seated for a significant amount of time and need a comfortable seat that provides the necessary support and 
balance without continuing to feel any discomfort (S. Amer & Onyebueke 2013) 
 
Throughout the years, numerous studies have been done on seats and the evaluation process depends on an individual’s 
feedback after a prototype of the seat is made (R. Lueder & Noro 1994). If the evaluation identifies issues in terms of 
seat comfort or long-term discomfort, retrofitting is the way forward. This is a complex process as it is not easy to 
rework a seat due to resource limitations and the cost involved (S. T. Amer & Onyebueke 2013). Another shortcoming 
of the traditional process is the variability in the subjective opinion based on how a person sits or feels at that time.",,"Proceedings of the 6th African Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,

the best sitting comfort. This study was limited to analyzing different seat designs and sitting postures. Future 
development of this work will consider the influence of changing the parameters of seat features and studying the 
effect of sitting time to consider additional vital aspects affecting the comfort level.

Abstract 
 
This project proposes a novel approach to bolster workplace safety in foundries through the implementation of an 
integrated sensor network for real-time air quality monitoring and risk prediction. Foundry environments are notorious 
for their hazardous conditions, primarily due to the emission of harmful particulate matter and gases during metal 
casting processes. Traditional safety measures often fall short of effectively mitigating these risks. Therefore, our 
system aims to revolutionize safety protocols by providing continuous, accurate monitoring of air quality parameters 
such as particulate matter concentration, gas emissions, temperature, and humidity. Leveraging advanced data 
analytics and machine learning algorithms, the system can predict potential risk events and provide timely alerts to 
workers and management, enabling proactive intervention strategies. By establishing a safer work environment, this 
innovative solution not only safeguards the health and well-being of foundry workers but also enhances operational 
efficiency and productivity. This interdisciplinary endeavor amalgamates expertise in sensor technology, data science, 
and industrial safety to forge a pathway toward sustainable workplace practices in the foundry industry.","Proceedings of the 6th African Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,

4.6 Data Integration and Management 
Data integration and management are fundamental to ensure that data from diverse sources is harmonized and made 
useful for analysis, reporting, and decision-making. Data from various sensors (measuring particulates, gases, and 
VOCs) and external sources (like weather data) are integrated using advanced data management platforms. These 
systems utilize middleware solutions that standardize data formats, synchronize data streams, and ensure seamless 
data flow into analysis applications. Modern integration platforms also support the handling of big data volumes, 
employing technologies such as Apache Kafka and Hadoop for real-time data processing and large-scale data storage 
(Carluccio et al. 2023).Given the sensitivity of environmental data, especially when linked to public health, strict data 
security is in place. These include encryption, access controls, and regular audits to comply with data protection 
regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that data is handled responsibly. 
 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, the proposed air quality monitoring and risk prediction framework presents a comprehensive solution 
for ensuring worker safety in foundry environments. By integrating sensors, data transmission protocols, and a 
centralized monitoring system, we provide real-time insights into crucial air quality parameters. Algorithms for risk 
prediction enable proactive measures, aligning with Utilization Reduction Roadmap goals.","Proceedings of the 6th African Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,

Moving forward, the framework will evolve to incorporate advancements in sensor technology and data analytics, 
enhancing predictive capabilities. Additionally, efforts will focus on scalability and interoperability to accommodate 
future integration needs. The development of wearable devices will continue to prioritize individualized monitoring, 
promoting worker empowerment.In summary, this framework not only addresses current challenges but also sets the 
stage for ongoing innovation and improvement in occupational health and environmental sustainability within the 
foundry industry.

Abstract 
 
The increasing development of smart technologies is revolutionizing the supply chain by improving efficiency, 
visibility, and decision-making. Thus, these smart technologies would, if implemented in Reverse logistics, which 
involves the handling of returned, reused, or recycled products, significantly reduce the challenges related to cost, 
coordination, and sustainability to improve efficiency. In order to evaluate the efficiency and the impact of these new 
integrations, our study will employ simulation model to assess the impact of smart technologies by comparing a 
classical reverse logistics supply chain with no smart technologies integration and then multiple scenarios with each 
we integrate a new different smart technology and then one final scenarios where we will implement the maximum of 
smart technologies. Through these simulations, we analyze how these implementations can improve key performance 
indicators, including cost reduction, processing speed, and environmental sustainability. By comparing different 
integration strategies, this research identifies the most effective configurations for leveraging smart technologies in 
reverse logistics. 
 
The findings highlight the potential benefits of these innovations, offering insights for businesses seeking to enhance 
their sustainability efforts while improving operational performance. This study contributes to the growing body of","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

6. Conclusion  
This study highlights the significant potential of smart technologies in improving reverse logistics performance. The 
comparative analysis of three scenarios demonstrates that smart technology integration can lead to notable 
enhancements in either operational efficiency (as seen in Scenario 2) or value recovery (as seen in Scenario 3), both 
contributing to increased net gains compared to the baseline scenario. These findings suggest that smart 
technologies—such as IoT-enabled tracking, automated sorting systems, and data-driven decision support—can serve 
as powerful enablers for more sustainable and cost-effective reverse logistics systems.However, several limitations 
must be acknowledged. First, the scenarios are based on simulated or case-specific data, which may not fully capture 
the complexity and variability of real-world supply chains. Second, the study focuses primarily on quantitative 
indicators (time, cost, recovered value, net gain) and does not explore qualitative impacts such as customer 
satisfaction, employee adaptability, or environmental benefits. Third, the adoption of smart technologies often requires 
significant upfront investment and organizational change, factors that were not fully integrated into the evaluation 
model. 
 
Future research should aim to validate these findings through empirical case studies across diverse industries and 
geographical contexts. Additionally, expanding the analysis to include social and environmental performance 
indicators, as well as long-term return on investment, would provide a more holistic understanding of the role smart 
technologies play in shaping next-generation reverse logistics systems. 
Future efforts should focus on developing strategic partnerships between government, academia, and industry to 
support the digital transformation of reverse logistic

Abstract 
 
In the context of X-ray facilities, this project addresses the crucial need for radiation safety, specifically regarding 
healthcare personnel, like hospital cleaners, who are exposed to radiation for extended periods. Due to their 
proximity to X-ray facilities, hospital cleaners are subjected to the risk of ionizing radiation exposure, whereas there 
is a scarcity of real-time data on exposure in these existing safety standards. It is also recommended that a GPS 
device be used for real-time mapping and exposure tracking so that interventions can be directed and cleaner safety 
can be improved. 
 
Keywords 
X-ray facilities, radiation safety, real-time monitoring, healthcare workers, GPS devices, and ionizing radiation. 
 
1. Introduction 
Radiation safety in X-ray facilities is a significant concern for patients, doctors, and hospital staff. Over the years, 
ionizing radiation has become an important diagnostic and treatment modality used in various hospital departments 
such as surgery, radiology, and interventional cardiology. Despite its benefits, the tool also has harmful effects, 
including cancer risk for people exposed to ionizing radiation (Hamzian et al. 2022). As such, radiation safety 
programs protect staff, especially hospital cleaners who spend considerable time in and around the X-ray rooms 
after patients and doctors, from the harmful waves. 
 
Radiation-related safety measures and protection are of utmost importance when protecting the health and ensuring 
the well-being of all patients and healthcare providers in different hospitals. Even though X-ray facilities are essential 
for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes, they come with the intrinsic dangers of exposure to ionizing radiation (Guide","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025

6. Results and Discussion 
Hospital cleaners who get ionizing radiation benefit from X-ray installations with real-time GPS monitoring. This 
improves vulnerable medical personnel's health and safety, as well as Increases radiation safety using contemporary 
monitoring and safety systems. Real-time radiation monitoring and mapping using GPS is a novel risk assessment and 
reduction tool (Ahmad et al. 2021). 
 
Hospitals use GPS trackers to detect radiation exposure and improve worker safety and cleanliness. This approach 
collects live data on exposure levels, a significant improvement over earlier technologies that may not provide rapid 
feedback on possible threats. This technology cuts the period between radiation exposure detection and response by 
providing real-time monitoring, possibly decreasing chronic ionizing radiation health hazards. This initiative 
emphasizes real-time data to improve radiation safety and provide a more flexible radiation security system. This 
connection allows safety measures to be dynamically updated depending on exposure levels instead of static standards. 
Thus, this unique technique makes hospital workers safer and more responsive by immediately addressing and 
lowering radiation exposure hazards. Radiation safety is improved via real-time monitoring. Instead of fixed 
guidelines, this integration should make radiation safety more dynamic and allow immediate exposure-based 
modifications. Workers may be protected or restricted in high-radiation hospitals. This data-driven approach may help 
hospitals create better safety measures based on exposure trends. 
 
GPS radiation monitoring devices may alter hospital housekeeping and staff training and awareness (Rajendran et al. 
2021). Radiation exposure data may help employees comprehend job risks. Safety standards encourage compliance 
and develop a safety culture as workers realize their immediate benefits. Exposure tracking helps assess and improve 
radiation safety programs. 
 
Real-time monitoring is beneficial, but the project values radiation safety holistically. Monitoring needs technical 
skills, communication, training, and stakeholder engagement. Hospital management, safety authorities, cleaners, and 
others must adopt GPS-based monitoring systems. Stakeholder involvement needs assessment, and continual 
education is needed to adopt and utilize this technology. Real-time Radiation Monitoring GPS gadgets increase 
radiation protection. This solution gives hospital cleaners and other healthcare workers fast, actionable data to be safe. 
Success depends on its ability to seamlessly integrate with existing safety procedures, create a safety culture, and 
include all stakeholders in a safer workplace. Ionizing radiation in X-ray facilities may be reduced via innovation and 
safety, safeguarding healthcare workers. 
7. Conclusion 
Real-time radiation monitoring GPS systems in X-ray facilities increase hospital housekeeping and worker safety.

Abstract 
 
In this study, we analyzed the neural phenomenon of decision-making from the perspective of cognitive modes. The 
main purpose of this study is to investigate the detectability of human decisions from brain signals by a computerized 
program. We delved into the neural signals to understand the brain functions of the cognitive modes in a binary 
decision-making context. The decision-making process is based on two different cognitive modes, which are intuitive 
and analytic. As they are opposite and conflicting by definition and characteristics, we aim to find out whether the 
mode significantly affects the detectability of the decision. We introduced time limitation vs. adequate time, unclear 
knowledge vs. clear knowledge, and absence of information during decision-making vs. the availability of information 
to create an intuitive cognitive mode and analytic mode, respectively. We used a modified Artificial Grammar 
Learning (AGL) design combined with a Yes/No binary context to create a binary decision-making event. We 
collected the brain signal during the decision-making using the noninvasive Electroencephalography (EEG) technique. 
For the investigation of the detectability of the decision, we used the supervised Machine Learning technique for 
classification analysis. We achieved 95% average accuracy in Analytic mode and 93% accuracy in intuitive mode. 
With the aim of efficient design, we also identified the top 5 channels for each mode, which can provide up to 80% 
average accuracy for detecting decisions. This study also suggests that the best Machine Learning algorithms for this 
purpose are the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) and RF  (Random Forest) classifiers.

1. Introduction 
In the world of competition and comparison, success and achievement are quite dependent on proper decision-making 
and also proper communication of decisions to the executing body. Decision-making is such a domain we cannot 
define it in a single idea. It can range from moving fingers to grabbing a pen to sign a contract of a million-dollar deal. 
As intelligent systems are taking place everywhere in human life to make life easier, the machine's ability to understand 
the human's decision by directly reading their brain activity would make the decision-execution process swifter. The","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Figure 4. Five best channels' location on scalp for analytical and intuitive mode (Red colored for Intuitive and Green 
color for Analytic) 
While we can see that the detectability of the decision- Yes or No- is possible with 75%-80% average accuracy even 
with 5 channels, we can also observe that the most variance is coming from different locations for analytical and 
intuitive cognitive modes. These channel locations of the scalp are indicated in Figure 4., we can see that for different 
modes, the channels are quite clustered- intuitive at the left-front area and analytic at the right-hand area, having an 
overlapping at the mid-central zone. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This research undertook a novel approach to connect the human brain and advanced computerized systems. Whence, 
the above observations and findings from the study shade light in so many angles, it still has some limitations, and 
hence further improvement can be done in future studies. Firstly, this study is a preliminary approach, and therefore 
further refining and polishing can be done in future studies in designing the experiment. Secondly, which we will 
accept as the most critical drawback, is- the limited number of participants; to come to a conclusion scientifically, 
much more observation on a more diverse population is needed. Thirdly, to address the efficiency factor, we totally 
bypassed the pre-processing steps; in several previous studies, it has been established that normalization can improve 
the performance of the machine learning models (Firoz et al. 2022, 2023, 2024); in future studies, different levels of 
cleansing and pre-processing can be done to understand their effect on the model performance. Fourth, this study was 
designed with one kind of decision-making, based on AGL; to conclude or understand overall cognitive mode aspects, 
different kinds of study can be conducted and compared. Fifth, as a preliminary study, this study addressed a binary 
decision-making process, where, decision-making is such a complex process that in most cases it has more 
outcomes/choices rather than just two. Despite these limitations, this preliminary study offers a new look to improve 
human-machine teaming using human’s own assets (i.e. neural signals) and technological advancement of computers, 
and future studies.  
 
5.4 Validation 
From the above observations, we can see that our four research questions have been addressed adequately at the 
preliminary level and further studies can be conducted based on these findings to learn more about these matters. The 
first research question, where we wanted to understand whether the yes/no decision can be detected by a machine 
learning model, is answered as 94%-96% accuracy can be achieved with 30 channels. We can also see that the model’s 
performance is being affected at least at some level, by the mode of cognition. From the perspective of design 
efficiency, we presented the trend of decreasing performance when the number of channels is decreased. Also, this 
performance is achieved with completely raw data.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025 
© IEOM Society International 
Alongside the aimed research questions, this study also presents an observation regarding different cognitive modes. 
It is also observed that the best channels for intuitive and analytic decisions are totally different. This observation can 
draw a question toward neuroscience direction- whether those areas are associated with analytic and intuitive cognitive 
processing. However, we can state that the design can be customized based on the situation, considering the demand 
for cognitive mode in that situation. We can also state that, even with a mixed-mode scenario, reasonable accuracy 
can be achieved with proper channel selection.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This study suggests a hypothesis that the cognitive mode of decision-making can affect the design of the brain-machine 
interface. Also, the computational cost and discomfort can be reduced significantly (30 channels to 10 or 5 channels) 
by choosing the proper channels. Further studies with more participants will be able to draw conclusions about these 
hypotheses.

Abstract 
 
As blockchain technology advances, numerous businesses have expressed strong interest in their capacity to promote 
trust among different parties without relying on centralized authorities. While the success of cryptocurrencies validates 
blockchain’s decentralized value storage, its use in industrial contexts, such as supply chain management, is still in its 
early stages. Industrial ecosystems with a varied stakeholder base continue to experiment with private blockchains. 
However, many business blockchain projects have failed to acquire traction owing to bad design, insufficient 
stakeholder incentives, or circumstances where blockchain was not required. This highlights the importance of a 
thorough framework that assists blockchain designers in determining whether blockchain is applicable and guiding 
them through the process of building an effective corporate solution. The current research on blockchain designs is 
limited and mainly focuses on specialized applications. This article presents a Supply Chain Blockchain Design 
Framework (SCBDF), which provides a methodical approach to identifying viable blockchain use cases while also 
outlining the architectural features required for a multi-industry enterprise blockchain ecosystem.

5.Conclusion:  
To conclude, our study consists in developing a BCT design framework applied to supply chain management, tailored 
to enhance efficiency, transparency and resilience. The novel framework addresses the critical challenges including 
data security, traceability and operational inefficiency. Our current research phase is devoted to refining the design in 
order to ensure its scalability and adaptability across various supply chain ecosystems. 
As the system is actually in the design phase, future studies will focus on its practical applications in real supply chain 
scenarios. This should include testing the framework to approve its effectiveness and determining areas of 
optimization. Moreover, our ongoing work includes rigorous testing to assess its performance under a variety of 
operational conditions. 
By providing insights into the practical implementation and outcomes, future research will contribute to the 
advancement of BCT-enabled supply chain systems. These steps will pave the way for a robust, reliable solution that 
aligns with industry needs and promotes sustainable practices in supply chain management.

Abstract  
 
Agro-food supply chain integration plays a growingly important role in the stable and sustainable development of 
agriculture. However, it is challenging for core firms to integrate the small-scale cooperatives and scatted farmers due 
to complex transaction processes and volatile relationships. Agricultural co-operatives are organizations that unite 
farmers’ power and help them achieve economic benefits. As a result, Agricultural cooperatives requires constantly 
researching new methods and strategies to make their operations sustainable. 
This study analyzes how COPAG, Morocco’s largest dairy cooperative, leverages vertical and horizontal integration 
to enhance supply chain resilience, market access, and socioeconomic equity for smallholder farmers. Drawing on 
empirical fieldwork from previous studies, the research evaluates COPAG’s dual integration model: vertically 
controlling milk production, processing, and distribution while horizontally partnering with smaller cooperatives to 
pool resources and negotiate collectively.Using mixed methods—including interviews with COPAG managers, annual 
reports and policy documents—the study reveals that vertical integration reduced post-harvest losses through 
centralized quality control and stabilized farmer incomes via fixed-price contracts. Horizontal integration diversified 
revenue streams, enabling collective bargaining power and bulk procurement of inputs, which lowered costs. 
Membership in COPAG increased farmer incomes with smallholders transitioning to medium/large-scale operations 
through access to shared infrastructure and training programs.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents an original multi-objective optimization model for increasing the generation capacity of renewable 
technologies under stochastic power outages and load shedding. The model aims to minimize the total costs of capital, 
and operations and maintenance (O&M), while maximizing the number of total annual jobs created in the 
manufacturing, installation, and operation phases of the renewable energy sources (RES). The model focuses on wind, 
solar photovoltaic (PV), and concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies predominantly used in South Africa. 
Lithium-ion batteries are used as a storage system to stockpile energy for the anticipation of load shedding. Two 
intervention methods, Expected Value Approach (EVA) and Scenario Chance Constrained Programming (SCCP), are 
applied to derive the deterministic equivalents of the stochastic constraints. A preemptive optimization approach is 
used to reduce the multi-objective model to single-objective solutions. The coefficient of variation is then used to 
compare the variation of the renewable generation from the two methods to the profile of the historical generation. 
The SCCP has a lower percentage error of variation than the EVA, thus validating its application when precision is 
critical. A sensitivity analysis is performed by varying the minimum required contribution parameter, which shows an 
upward trend in the total costs and annual jobs mainly influenced by increasing the capacity of CSP and PV 
respectively. The study uses a novel model to estimate renewable generation required to offset generation deficit, thus 
illustrating that increasing the nominal capacities of the RES in South Africa can mitigate the crisis of power outages.

1. Introduction 
Electrical energy plays a vital role in the perpetual growth and development of a country's economy. It is important to 
take more measures to ensure a continuous and efficient supply of electricity to support other sectors, such as 
production and transportation, in a country. However, the demand fluctuates because of peak periods when demand 
is higher and the continuous growth of electricity consumers. If the demand is higher than the supply, an imbalance is 
created, consequently leading to the complete collapse of the power system, which can result in nationwide power 
outages. The equilibrium state between the supply and demand side is of paramount concern in the operation of the 
grid (Wang et al. 2014). Forecasting demand and planning supply to meet the demand serves as an important 
management strategy. 
 
In the year 2022 and 2023, South Africa experienced 3776 hours (157 days) and 6907 hours (288 days) of load 
shedding respectively. Load shedding, also known as Manual Load Reduction (MLR), is the amount of demand that 
has been reduced to maintain a balance between supply and demand (Eskom 2025). Load shedding is a demand-side 
management response to unplanned events to safeguard the power system from complete failure. Some of the negative 
implications of power outages include loss of earnings resulting from the cost of unserved energy, clients' loss of 
confidence from dissatisfaction, and decline in goods production, hence loss of revenues resulting from loss in sales.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

each of the sources became 0, and increased in steps of 0.2 to 1 where the percentage requirement reached 54%, 36%, 
and 8% for wind, solar PV, and CSP, respectively. Figure 4 shows the effect on the total costs and number of jobs 
created. 
 
As expected, decreasing the percentage minimum requirement results in a decrease in the total costs and total annual 
jobs created, while increasing the percentage minimum requirement leads to an increase in the two objectives. From 
Figure 4, it can be deduced that the increasing total costs are influenced mostly by the increasing requirement for CSP 
contribution. This is confirmed by the high capital and fixed O&M costs associated with CSP power plants. The 
upward trend of the total annual jobs seems to be driven by the increasing requirement for PV contribution. This is 
explained by the fact that PV has the highest aggregate job factor compared to the other sources.

6. Conclusion 
Operations research is an important area of research for modeling uncertainties in energy systems. This paper 
formulated a mixed integer non-linear stochastic multi-objective model to minimize the total costs of capital, fixed 
and variable O&M, and maximize the number of job opportunities. The uncertainties in RES and unplanned power 
outages were approximated with their expected values using EVA, and scenarios using SCCP. The EVA yielded lower 
total costs and job opportunities than the SCCP approach. However, validating EVA and SCCP RES generation 
against the historical generation showed that the SCCP method approximated the uncertainty better than the EVA. 
This is important for decision-makers since the correct generation characteristic will ensure a reliable and stable grid 
when integrating RES. Despite this, the EVA method can be considered in instances with financial limitations. If 
budget is a concern, decision-makers can use the EVA recommendations, but if a stable grid is more important, the 
SCCP recommendations should be used. Sensitivity analysis revealed that there is an existing direct proportional 
relationship between the objectives, the nominal capacities, and the amount of energy generated. 
 
The model can be improved by adding an annual budget as a constraint, thus having an expansion plan spanning 
several years/ periods. This is quite realistic since the overnight expansion of RES is impracticable for a developing 
country.

Abstract  
 
Uncontrolled or poorly managed traffic flow leads to congestion, increased safety risks, and excessive emissions, 
making sustainable traffic management a key challenge. Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control has emerged as a 
promising solution to regulate traffic flow dynamically. However, designing an effective VSL strategy is complex due 
to the conflicting nature of multiple objectives mobility, safety, and environmental sustainability. In this study, we 
investigate the potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize VSL decisions while balancing these 
competing goals. We define a gain function as the reward, incorporating different weight configurations to assess their 
impact on speed regulation, traffic efficiency, CO₂ emissions, and safety. The evaluation is carried out on a 
microscopic case study, representing a controlled highway in Morocco, modeled using the SUMO traffic simulation 
software, where we test and compare three different DRL algorithms to determine their effectiveness in learning 
sustainable VSL policies. To analyze the performance of the trained agents, we track various traffic indicators that 
reflect traffic flow efficiency, risk reduction and environmental impact. The results demonstrate the agent’s role in 
improving overall traffic conditions by striking a balance across key traffic aspects of mobility, safety and 
sustainability.

Abstract 
 
The increasing complexity of modern industrial systems and the demand for higher productivity have driven the need 
for more advanced maintenance strategies. Traditional predictive maintenance (PdM) has improved failure 
forecasting, yet it struggles to integrate maintenance planning, production scheduling, and quality control into a unified 
framework. Prescriptive maintenance (PsM) addresses these limitations by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), 
machine learning (ML), and IoT-driven analytics to not only predict failures but also recommend optimal maintenance 
actions, thereby reducing downtime and enhancing operational efficiency. This study investigates the role of PsM in 
optimizing production efficiency, focusing on its impact on resource allocation, asset longevity, and decision 
automation. A systematic review of recent advancements highlights PsM's ability to enhance real-time maintenance 
strategies while identifying key challenges such as cybersecurity risks, data integration issues, and industry-specific 
implementation barriers. By bridging the gap between predictive insights and autonomous maintenance, PsM is 
shaping the future of intelligent, resilient manufacturing ecosystems.",,"Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025 
© IEOM Society International 
Second, we have thoroughly examined PsM's impact on production optimization, highlighting its significant 
contributions to downtime reduction, resource allocation efficiency, and enhanced operational decision-making. The 
evidence indicates that industries implementing PsM can achieve maintenance cost reductions of 15-25% and 
downtime reductions of up to 50% compared to traditional approaches. 
 
Third, we have identified and analyzed key challenges in PsM adoption, including data quality issues, system 
integration complexities, scalability concerns, and human factors. Our research suggests these challenges can be 
systematically addressed through phased implementation approaches, strategic sensor deployment, and 
comprehensive workforce training.The unique contribution of this research lies in its comprehensive analysis of the 
technological evolution from predictive to prescriptive maintenance paradigms across multiple industries. Unlike 
previous studies that focused predominantly on specific industries or technologies, our research provides a holistic 
framework for understanding how PsM functions as a crucial bridge between predictive insights and autonomous 
maintenance. By synthesizing findings from manufacturing, railway, and robotics domains, we offer a cross-sectoral 
perspective that illuminates common implementation patterns and challenges. 
 
Looking forward, this research identifies several promising directions for future work, including the development of 
standardized PsM implementation frameworks, investigation of AI explainability in maintenance decisions, and 
exploration of hybrid human-AI decision-making models. As Industry 4.0 continues evolving toward Industry 5.0, 
prescriptive maintenance will likely become increasingly central to creating resilient, efficient, and autonomous 
industrial ecosystems. 
 
By bridging the gap between predictive insights and actionable maintenance decisions, PsM represents not merely an 
incremental improvement but a paradigm shift in industrial maintenance strategy—one that will be essential for 
maintaining competitive advantage in increasingly complex manufacturing environments.

Abstract 
 
This study investigated the effects of competition from peer-to-peer accommodation platforms like Airbnb on 
Hotel X’s strategic operations, profits and market share. Using a mixed method approach the study made use of 
both quantitative questionnaires from potential guests as well as qualitative interviews with Hotel X’s employees 
so as to assess how competition from peer-to-peer accommodation platforms influence hotel profits, customer 
preferences and pricing strategies. Findings from the study showed critical challenges Hotel X is facing including 
a major shift in guest preferences toward flexible, personalized experiences and affordable accommodations which 
are provided by peer-to-peer platforms. In order to respond to the competition from peer-to-peer platforms, Hotel 
X has adapted through implementation of pricing strategies that are flexible and they have also improved their 
loyalty programs so as to keep competitive advantage. However, the feedback from guests highlights how 
important further improvements in personalization and service quality are needed. The study finds that Hotel X 
needs to use digital marketing, improve guest experiences through personalized experiences and change their 
pricing strategies so as to position itself more effectively against the pressures from competition with peer-to-peer 
platforms. 
 
Key Words:  
Hotel X, Peer-to-Peer Accommodation, Guest Preferences, Market Competition.  
 
Introduction 
Background of the study 
Competition from peer-to-peer accommodation platforms has caused significant challenges of loss in market share 
and profits for Hotel X and has affected their pricing strategies and meeting consumer needs. Peer-to-peer 
accommodation platforms give guests access to look for and book accommodation options and give hosts access 
to post their properties and set prices that are to their liking according to (Sainaghi  2020). According to 
(Tusaayadiah 2016) peer-to-peer accommodation platforms are rapidly growing segments in the hospitality 
industry which provide consumers with affordable, personalized and unique accommodation options while hosts 
make an income through renting out properties they own. (Birinci 2018) states that peer-to-peer accommodations 
have become a popular alternative option to traditional hotels like Hotel X and has caused commotion in the 
hospitality industry in the past few years. (Dolnicar 2018) states that Airbnb has changed how people think about 
accommodation through its sharing economy business model, affordable pricing and consumer experience which 
challenge traditional hotel’s position in the market. 
 
       Problem Statement 
       The emergence of peer-to-peer accommodation platforms like Airbnb have brought significant competition to 
Hotel X. These peer-to-peer platforms offer consumers cost effective, personalized and unique accommodation 
options that appeal to a large segment of consumers. This has resulted in hotel X facing problems in maintaining 
a market share and profitability which has led to challenges in changing pricing strategies and meeting consumer 
needs.","Proceedings of the 6th African Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,

Sample and Population size 
The population for this study will include potential guests of Hotel X as well as employees from Hotel X. The 
population size is 37 people, that includes 12 of Hotel X’s employees that would like to remain anonymous and 
25 potential guests with different ages and booking habits. 
 
From the population size the researcher will interview 10 employees and 20 potential guests as part of their sample 
size which will make a total of 30. From the 10 employees, 2 are managers from Hotel X, 5 work at the front desk 
at different branches of Hotel X and 3 employees work in Maintenance at Hotel X. From the 20 potential guests, 
5 have visited hotel X multiple times, 5 are new guests, 5 use Peer-to-peer accommodations only and 5 guests use 
both accommodations and hotels. The researcher chose to interview 10 of Hotel X’s staff as part of the sample 
size so that they can gather data from important areas in Hotel X like the hotel desk. They also chose 20 potential 
guests as part of their sample size so that can get valuable data on guest preferences and behaviors. 
 
Procedure for Data Collection 
The researcher will use Interviews as a tool to get information from Hotel X’s employees. The researcher chose 
semi- structured interviews as a data collection tool for this study because they allow for the collection of in-
depth, thorough and detailed information which is important to understand the impact of peer-to-peer 
accommodation platforms on Hotel X.  According to (Fox. N, 2009) Interviews help in gathering rich information 
and help in drawing more thorough conclusions than any other research methods.  The researcher used a 
combination of open ended and closed questions in their interviews with the employees at Hotel X so as to gather 
thorough data while making sure that the important topics were covered. 
 
The researcher will also use Questionnaires as a tool to get information from Hotel X’s potential guests. According 
to (Rowley 2014) questionnaires serve as tools for acquiring and documenting data on important topics for a 
specific study. Questionnaires can be structured with open ended questions, close ended questions or both and 
they are helpful when gathering data from many people in an efficient and systematic way (Cohen 2017) states. 
The researcher chose questionnaires because their format of standardization makes sure that all participants 
answer the same questions in the same way which comes handy in differentiating responses. The researcher 
distributed the questionnaire form through social media and email so as to reach the right audience. 
4.Data Analysis and Interpretation 
The data gathered from the qualitative interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which was developed 
by (Terry et al. 2006), this analysis involves the following steps:  Familiarizing yourself with the data, going 
through the data to identify any interesting features and assigning codes, Evaluate the codes to find important 
patterns, Examine the patterns and compare them with the original data, Define and name the patterns and 
Interstate the patterns into coherent answers and write a report.

Abstract 
The study was about improving safety and machine maintenance in the organisation, the organisation was facing 
a problem of not having fully trained employees which leads to machine breakdown, which can cause hazards. 
The study aimed to develop a safety training program that also looks at machine maintenance. The study had four 
main objectives, proposing a safety training program, analysing training materials used in the organization, 
outsourcing new practices that will improve machine learning and identifying areas to improve current practices. 
Interviews were conducted as one of the methodologies to identify exactly what the problem is and the gap that 
the current practices are leaving in terms of organisational safety. The study found that a majority of employees 
were aware of the maintenance issues of the machinery, however had no context in terms of when the maintenance 
should be undertaken. The study recommended that a training program for workers should be provided, focusing 
on the machine safety and machine maintenance.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the study 
The organisation is one of SA’s top manufacturer in products that are used in several industries. It produces 
sponges, gasket, and insulation forms to these industries. It utilizes machines to cut materials and producing those 
products and sometimes those machines are not used properly which can result in machine breakdowns and that 
can cause a delay. Employees are not fully trained and that has resulted in two severe accidents that has endangered 
employee’s health and put the organization in a very bad position. Employee safety is important to ensure that 
such problems do not occur, with sufficient training this could have been avoided. Machine maintenance also 
plays a significant role in making sure that the machines are working at a 100%, to reduce them from causing 
defects on materials and avoid injuries that can decrease productivity rate. Every organization should have a fully 
proofed machine training to ensure that all employees are trained in using those machines (Glenn Platt 2018). 
 
1.2 Problem statement 
Maintaining machines is very crucial in organisations as it provides a sense of safety when employees are using 
them to avoid accidents and failure. The lack of training can result in inconsistencies in safety practices, 
compliance issues and decrease effectiveness in the organization. The research focused on examining how 
implementing a safety program that that emphasizes safety in machine learning to decreases the chances of 
accidents and defects. 
 
1.3 Aim  
Develop a complete safety training course that relates to machine maintenance. 
 
1.4 Objectives 
• 
Develop a safety training program suitable to the organization’s specific machine needs. 
• 
Analyse training materials employees use to learn about machine dangers and offer needed skills. 
• 
Evaluate opportunities for direct practices of using machines.",,"Proceedings of the 6th African Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Abstract 
 
This research was directed at investigating the viability and consequences of employing Internet of Things (IoT) 
solutions at a theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa – a widely visited theatre with significant obstacles in 
relationship to aging infrastructures, ineffective resource utilization, and low audience ship. The objective of 
this research was to assess the applicability of IoT adoption to solve these operational challenges and at the 
same time improve performance, security, and sustainability by making use of technology and infrastructure used 
in theatres The study outlines areas of the theatre’s operation that can be redesigned and its benefits of using IoT 
which includes facility management, security, and audiences and evaluates the level of technological 
sophistication needed to apply IoT to those areas. This strategy recommends a gradual implementation process 
relevant to the course the theatre must operate considering the costs, maximum expansion capacity, and prospects 
for growth. Therefore, through IoT solutions, through this research, the theatre should manage to improve on the 
utilization of the resources to the audience, and the general productivity of the theatre, hence increasing its 
sustainability and its ability to adapt to change. This can be done using the Internet of Things Evolution. Even 
though the study is conducted directly with the Theatre, it elaborates on how IoT can be implemented to 
organizations with similar issues all over the world and the Usage of IoT in Theatres.  
Key words: Technology and the Infrastructure Used in Theatres, Internet of Things – Evolution, Benefits of Using 
Internet of Things, Usage of IoT in Theatres. 
 
1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the study 
The implementation of the Internet of Things has emerged as a new strategy across various sectors and 
organizations that deal with different departments, which has completely changed the way we interact with 
technology and enhanced operational efficiencies. With its ability to interconnect physical devices and enable data 
exchange over a network, IoT has garnered significant attention due to its potential to optimize processes, improve 
decision-making, and enhance user experiences. As Johnson (2011) emphasizes, the implementation of IoT 
technologies offers immense opportunities for organizations to innovate and stay competitive in today's digital 
landscape. 
 
The Theatre, renowned for its cultural significance and contribution to the arts, stands as a prominent institution 
in need of technological advancement to streamline its operations and enhance audience engagement. By 
leveraging IoT solutions, the Theatre can revolutionize various aspects of its functioning, ranging from facility 
management to audience experience enhancement. However, the successful implementation of IoT at the Theatre 
requires a comprehensive understanding of its unique requirements, challenges, and opportunities. 
 
1.2 Problem Statement 
The Theatre, despite its esteemed reputation and historical significance, grapples with a myriad of challenges in 
its operational landscape. Chief among these challenges is the outdated infrastructure and inefficient resource 
management practices, which impede the theatre's ability to deliver optimal experiences to its audience and 
stakeholders.","Proceedings of the 6th African Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
The findings have shown that on top of the list, the range of communication and the accuracy and precision remain, 
respectively the first and second concerns appear to be the most common area where the IoT should be improved 
at the theatre. From the findings, it can be further confirmed that the viewers' experiences are the most essential 
benefit of the implementation of the IoT at the theatre Walie (2024) stated that the viewer's experience remains 
one of the essential elements for immersive experience for the audience, customization and creativity. 
The implementation of the Internet of Things at the theatre plays a big role in the operation management process 
in terms of data collection, security concerns, viewers' experience, and easy access at the theatre for any organiser, 
no matter where they could be on earth. Therefore, all participants at the theatre need to be aware of measures that 
can be used to enforce the use of the Internet of Things at the theatre for the operation management sector It is 
recommended that. 
 
The top management team in the operation management organisations must contribute to the application of the 
IoT as well as new technologies by being innovative and supportive also by training the employees on the adoption 
of the Digitalization of the operation management sector also by training the workers on the adoption of the 
Digitalization of the operation management sector. Organisations with resistant employees must focus on 
establishing user acceptance by fostering a positive attitude toward the learning process of the labour force on the 
use of IoT in the operation management sector. This will help the organisation to face different challenges, the 
implementation of IoT at the theatre.

Abstract 
 
With the explosive growth of world trade crossing continental boundaries and the inroads made by ecommerce into 
virtually every market, the logistics infrastructure has been severely strained. This makes it imperative to strive to 
streamline logistics processes in an effort to maximize profit while ensuring world-class customer satisfaction. 
Technology can be leveraged as the key enabler in this process. In recent years, technology has advanced by leaps and 
bounds and there are many technological concepts that can be easily applied to improve logistics management. These 
include artificial intelligence, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, drones, and Internet of Things (IoT) to name a few. 
However, the implementation of these technologies are fraught with challenges due to a combination of factors such 
as the need for investment, resistance to change and a lack of holistic systems perspective.

Technology, logistics, supply chain,  
 
1. Introduction  
With the growth of world trade and a flourishing ecommerce market, logistics infrastructure and services world over 
are becoming more and more strained. This is further compounded by consumer expectations of receiving goods and 
services as quickly as possible. Alongside the significant improvements in the energy sector with reduced reliance on 
fossil fuels and increased use of electric vehicles, it is also imperative that the system is optimized to maximize profits 
while ensuring exemplary customer satisfaction, and meeting the regulatory requirements. It has also been shown 
(Nunez-Merino et al. 2024) that in order to ensure a competitive advantage, it is imperative to develop capabilities in 
an organization that seek to provide improved customer value. Technology can be leveraged in different ways to 
achieve this competitive advantage. It can serve as a key enabler to reap significant benefits in a myriad of sectors. It 
has made inroads into agriculture, food processing, energy conservation, manufacturing, and supply chain 
management.  
 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of this manuscript is to explore the different ways in which technology can be leveraged to alleviate 
some of the pressure being exerted on logistics infrastructure and systems. Some of the advantages and disadvantages 
of these instruments are also examined.  
 
2. Literature Review 
Some of the high-level technological advances that have relevance and significance in logistics management include 
additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, blockchains, drones, Internet of Things (IoT), 
radio frequence identification (RFID). The following sections summarize some of the applications of these 
technologies along with their challenges.","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025

2.7 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been around for many decades. However, in the recent years, it has gain 
popularity for the real time tracking ability that can be leveraged to track shipments as they enter or leave warehouses, 
ports, etc. This technology is based on near frequency and requires low power. Companies like Walmart have begun 
requiring its suppliers to use RFID tags for their shipments. Another application of RFID allows for geofencing 
(Oliveira et al 2015) to prevent thefts.  
 
3 Challenges 
Despite all the affordances of technology aimed at improving efficiencies and streamlining operations, logistics 
companies are faced with numerous challenges and barriers (Biswas and Gupta 2019).  
  
3.1 Lack of Uniform Standards and Regulations 
Given the pace at which technology has been progressing, oftentimes state and federal agencies are playing catch up 
in framing regulations to ensure safety and privacy. This begets numerous ad hoc and fragmented approaches which 
often are neither easily portable or scalable. Moreover, this also means there is no oversight to ensure compliance 
leaving systems vulnerable to attacks. . Moreover, due to a lack of uniform standards, there is a proliferation of 
divergent systems that are not conducive to seamless integration. 
 
3.2 Resistance to change 
As with any innovation, there is always a resistance to change due to skepticism (Mani and Chouk, 2018) about the 
efficacy of new technologies. There is also the issue of automation negatively impacting jobs. It is true that some jobs 
are eliminated as a result of automation and technology. However, this only provides more opportunities for upskilling 
and engaging in higher-order thinking leading to more innovation and processing improvement.  
 
3.3 High Cost of Investment 
Another hurdle is the cost of implementation. There is often significant upfront investment required to effectively 
implement these technologies. With all the resulting challenges of acceptance and resistance to change, organizations 
tend to be hesitant to embrace these technologies with full earnest.  
 
3.4 Lack of Holistic Systems Perspective 
Due to a lack of understanding of how these technologies interact with existing systems and with each other, 
implementations tend to be fraught with challenges. Moreover, there tends to be a piecemeal approach to 
implementation resulting in a myriad of technologies that purport to do different things. This lack of a holistic approach 
to implementation of technology leads to duplication, inefficiencies, and a lack of interoperability.   
 
4. Conclusion  
Technological advances of the 21st century have made it possible to speed up the innovation and improvement 
processes in many sectors. This growth of technology has also helped in connecting remote suppliers and customers 
who may be geographically separated by long distances. However, the challenge of moving products across the globe 
has put a strain on the existing logistics infrastructure and systems. This includes ports, air freights, and road 
transportation. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, drones, blockchains and RFID can 
be leveraged to ease some of this burden. However, this is not without challenges which need to be overcome in order 
to maximize the benefits afforded by technological solutions for efficient logistics management.

Abstract 
 
This literature review examines the challenges of integrating the public transportation system in Palembang, including 
limited coverage, lack of intermodal connectivity, and suboptimal fare and information integration. The study aims to 
analyze the existing conditions, evaluate modal and operational integration, and design strategies for a more efficient, 
integrated, and sustainable transportation system. The research employs bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer, with 
data from Google Scholar, Scopus, ResearchGate, and Elsevier. Relevant articles are identified and analyzed through 
VOSviewer to map the relationships between articles, authors, and key research themes. The findings reveal research 
trends on integrated public transportation in Palembang, emphasizing policies, technology, and user experience. 
Research gaps are identified in modal integration, implementation approaches, and agglomeration connectivity. One 
underexplored aspect is the impact of policies on public transport integration, including regulations, incentives, and 
subsidies. This study highlights the importance of policy-based strategies, spatial planning, and technology to enhance 
public transport services. Additionally, a user-experience-driven approach is essential to developing a more integrated, 
efficient, and attractive public transportation system, encouraging a modal shift toward more sustainable mobility 
solutions.

1. Introduction  
1.1. Background 
Palembang has been selected as the focus of this study due to its characteristics as a rapidly developing metropolitan 
city that has implemented various mass transportation initiatives, including Light Rail Transit (LRT), feeder services, 
and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). However, the integration of public transportation systems remains a significant 
challenge requiring further attention. One of the main issues is the low intermodal connectivity, attributed to limited 
physical integration, the absence of integrated terminals, and insufficient transfer facilities. Additionally, fare 
integration has not been comprehensively implemented, forcing passengers to pay separate fares for each mode of 
transport. Another critical issue is the suboptimal dissemination of information, particularly regarding schedules and 
routes, which leads to uncertainty for users in planning their trips. 
 
The reality in various cities, including Palembang, indicates that the integration of public transportation systems 
remains suboptimal. As one of Indonesia's major cities experiencing rapid development, Palembang faces challenges 
in providing an efficient and integrated transportation system. Although multiple transport modes, such as LRT, BRT,","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management  Rabat, Morocco, April 7-10, 2025 
© IEOM Society International 
Thus, research on the development of an integrated public transportation system in Palembang and its surrounding 
areas (agglomeration) can fill the research gap and be further explored in future studies. Table 4 below presents the 
research gaps identified from previous studies. 
 
The literature review results indicate that the development of an integrated public transportation system in the 
Palembang agglomeration area is of high urgency to address transportation needs covering Palembang and its 
surrounding regions. This study emphasizes the importance of a locally contextualized approach, considering spatial 
planning, transportation policies, and customer satisfaction. The recommendations derived from this study are 
expected to serve as a foundation for the government and stakeholders in formulating policies and implementing a 
more efficient and sustainable transportation system. 
 
4. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the literature review and bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer, several research gaps need 
further investigation to enhance transportation system efficiency and customer satisfaction. The key findings are as 
follows: 
1. One major aspect that has received limited attention is the impact of policies on public transportation integration, 
including regulations, incentives, and subsidies that can encourage public transport usage. 
2. Improving customer satisfaction is a crucial focus in transportation system development, particularly through the 
implementation of information technology, service quality enhancement, and optimization of intermodal 
connectivity. 
3. Greater emphasis should be placed on policy strategies that support sustainable transportation and user experience-
based approaches to create a more integrated, efficient, and appealing public transportation system.

Abstract 
 
The processes and activities of the industrial sector are highly energy-intensive. With the increase in global 
population, urbanization, and consumer sophistication, demand for industrial products has increased in recent 
decades. The use of non-renewable energy sources to power industries triggers the emission of dangerous gases, 
exacerbates environmental degradation, and thus unsustainable. The current study explores avenues for deploying 
renewable energy technologies (RETs) for industrial applications. The use of bioenergy, solar power, and 
hydropower as energy sources for the industrial sector is eco-friendly, reduces production costs, and boosts 
industrial outputs. We suggest more collaborative research into the development and implementation of novel 
practices, technologies, and other innovations that encourage the use of RETs for the industrial sector. Policies 
and laws that encourage investments in RETs should be enacted and implemented. The utilization of RETs in the 
industrial sector will reduce toxic emissions and propel sustainable socioeconomic development.

1. Introduction  
Industrialization is the engine room for economic growth and development. Increased population, urbanization, 
and socioeconomic development have led to demand for industrial goods and products. However, meeting the 
demand for increased Industrial productivity requires more energy consumption. Bearing in mind that the 
industrial sector is one of the high energy consumption sectors. The share of global energy used in the industrial 
sector has continued to increase due to increased industrial activities and expansion of the industrial sector 
occasioned by the various industrial revolutions. For example, the industrial sector consumed about 33 % of the 
total energy use in 2000 and about 38 % in 2021 (iea 2022). This trend is projected to persist due to rising 
production in the energy-intensive industries. The total energy consumed in the industrial sector rose from 190.3 
quadrillion British thermal units (QBTU) in 2012 to 205.2 QBTU in 2020. The industrial sector energy 
consumption has been predicted to become 246.3 QBTU, 278.3 QBTU, and 307.8 QBTU by 2030, 2040, and 
2050, respectively (Figure 1) (eia 2016, Aizarani 2023). Of this figure, about 88 % is predicted to come from 
nonrenewable sources (coal, oil, and gas) while the remaining 12 % are renewables. As to be expected, emissions 
from the industrial sector rose to over 70 % in 2000. About 9.4 Gt of CO2, representing more than 25 % of the 
total global emission, was emitted in 2021 (iea 2022). 
 
To meet up with the energy requirement and reduce the ever-growing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other 
Greenhouse gas, there is a need to invest more in renewable energy technologies (RET). This has attracted the 
attention of researchers, energy producers, and other stakeholders intending to meet up with industrial 
productivity. In a recent study, Abbasi et al. (2022), Chang and Lee (2016), Ourya and Abderafiand (2023), and 
Ulewicz et al. (2021) investigated the energy requirement for the industrial sector for Pakistan, Taiwan, Morocco, 
and Poland, respectively. They recommended sustained investment in clean technologies for the production of 
renewable energy (RE) for the industrial sector of their respective countries. On a global scale  Taibi et al. (2012),","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

To meet up with the increased demand for electric power from renewable sources and mounting awareness of 
global warming, hydropower has witnessed enhanced funding and market value. The global market value for 
hydropower was USD 236.4 billion in 2021 became USD 248.6 billion in 2022, and has been predicted to become 
USD 371.8 billion in 2030 (Precedence Research 2022). In 2021, China, Canada, and Brazil topped the global 
hydroelectricity production countries with 1 300 TWh, 380 TWh, and 362 TWh, respectively (Fernández 2023). 
The continuous investment in hydropower production and development has continued to encourage increased 
utilization of hydroelectricity for various industrial applications. For example, hydropower is a major source of 
electricity for illumination and powering machines in the manufacturing sector.  In the mining and extractive 
industry, water from hydropower plants is used for flushing fluids out from the ground, reducing dust at mines, 
and mineral separation during the extraction of coal, uranium, gas, etc. Similarly, hydroelectricity has been used 
to supply power to aluminum extraction from electrolytic plants. Table 5 shows the economic and environmental 
benefits and limitations of hydropower in the industry.   the imperative of the process. There must also be a 
technological requirement for energy awareness to gain insight into the energy consumption pattern and identify 
areas of possible reduction. The use of smart meters based on the IIoT paradigm is key in metering real-time 
energy consumption data and monitoring the energy consumption pattern (Shrouf et al. 2017). This will lead to 
the implementation of energy saving initiatives to minimize energy consumption and emissions. Table 1 shows 
some of the strategies for achieving energy savings in manufacturing.  
4. Conclusion  
Increased global population, changes in lifestyle, and urbanization are some of the drivers of global growth in the 
industrial sector. The continuous growth of the industrial sector has also led to increased energy consumption. 
The reliance on non-renewable energy sources is at grave economic, environmental, and health implications. For 
sustainable industrial development and growth, there is a need to diversify the energy source to include more RE. 
This study has shown that the deployment of bioenergy, solar power, and hydropower will provide adequate and 
sustainable energy for the industrial sector. The application of these RE sources is cost-effective, emits fewer 
pollutants, is eco-friendly, easily accessible, and largely non-polluting. Though there are a few limitations and 
concerns associated with these RE sources, the overall benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. 
 
Going forward, more targeted collaborative investigations are desirable to unravel more low-cost and eco-friendly 
energy sources for the ever-growing industrial sector. The deployment of cutting-edge technologies simplifies 
some of the energy-intensive industrial processes and procedures to reduce energy consumption and save costs. 
Energy-efficient appliances, lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling systems, and other sector-specific machinery 
should be replaced with low-energy-consuming technologies. Novel technologies such as artificial intelligence, 
robotics, automation, smart meters, etc. should be adopted and used more in industrial processes to minimize 
energy consumption. There is a need to enact and implement more policies that encourage the use of RET for 
sustainable industrial development and the overall advantage of humanity. More investments and human capacity 
development are required in the RE sector to meet up with the demand for clean and affordable energy.

1. Introduction  
Efficient electricity transmission over long distances is key to meeting growing energy needs and integrating 
renewable energy sources into the electricity grid (IEA 2020). Global energy consumption shows that oil and coal are 
the most used fuels in the world (IEA 2022) (Figure 1). High-voltage transmission cables form the backbone of energy 
systems and enable the reliable and efficient transport of electricity from the generation source to the end user. As the 
world population continues to grow and industrialization advances, the demand for electricity continues to increase 
(IEA, 2019). Transmission line lengths by voltage class from 66 kV to 400 kV with minimum and maximum length 
of line (Calgary AB 2018) (Table 1). This requires the development of a robust transportation infrastructure capable 
of meeting current and future energy needs. The design of high-voltage transmission cables requires various technical 
considerations, including material selection, conductor configuration, optimization techniques, and environmental 
factors. Material selection is a crucial aspect of conductor design and influences factors such as electrical conductivity, 
mechanical strength, corrosion resistance and weight (CIGRE 2016). Comparison of material properties for high 
voltage conductors (EPP 2013) (Table 2, 2013). Aluminium and aluminium alloys are widely used due to their 
favourable combination of electrical and mechanical properties (Xie et al. 2020). Furthermore, advances in materials 
science have led to the development of composite materials such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP), which","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

6. Conclusion 
High-voltage transmission cables play a key role in providing efficient and reliable power over long distances in power 
systems. In this test, we examined various aspects of the design, including material selection, driver configuration, 
optimization techniques, and environmental considerations. The combination of these factors is crucial to ensure the 
efficiency, reliability and sustainability of the high-voltage transmission infrastructure. The choice of materials such 
as aluminium, aluminium alloys and composites such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) is crucial to achieve 
the desired balance between electrical conductivity, mechanical strength and resistance to heat and the environment. 
In addition, advances in conductor configurations such as: B. bundled conductors and composite core conductors, for 
improved performance and reliability by reducing electrical losses and mitigating problems such as galloping and 
icing. Optimization techniques, including wire sizing, spacing and tension, are essential to minimize sag, corona 
discharge and electrical losses.  
 
Advanced modelling and simulation tools such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics 
(CFD) enable accurate analysis and optimization of driver performance under various operating conditions. In 
addition, environmental adaptability is essential to ensure the durability of high-voltage transmission cables in harsh 
environments. The use of composite materials and galvanized coatings provides resistance to environmental 
influences, increasing durability and reducing maintenance requirements. In summary, high voltage transmission cable 
design is a multidimensional process that requires careful consideration of various factors. By integrating advanced 
materials, innovative configurations, optimization techniques and environmental adaptability, we can develop a 
transmission infrastructure that meets growing electricity demand while ensuring efficiency, reliability and 
sustainability of the power system. Through ongoing research and development efforts, there is a need to further 
improve the design of high voltage transmission cables to meet the changing challenges and opportunities of the 
energy landscape and ultimately contribute to the resilience and sustainability of global electricity systems.

Abstract 
 
Design and development of grey water filter that can outperform the existing ones formed the objective of this study. 
Making available reusable water from grey water is not only essential for improving the living standard of the populace 
but timely because of its contributions to the development and well-being of the masses. In this study, activated carbon 
was adopted in the place of piece of cloth for filtration of water, and to reduce the weight and make it more portable, 
lightweight materials were adopted. To optimize the filtration efficiency, multiple filters with varying pores were 
adopted in the design. The result showed that the developed filter device possessed higher filtering rating than the 
existing concepts.

1. Introduction 
In the efforts to minimize water wastages and conserve freshwater resources, several sectors around the world have 
urged households to make use of greywater for irrigation of their gardens. Greywater refers to the wastewater that can 
be reused for irrigation and other purposes that has been previously used for laundry, shower, and hand basin. Reusing 
greywater will reduce water consumption, conserve water resources, and cut household bills. This will ultimately 
reduce the demand of freshwater directed to the Department of water resources and maintain the access to safe and 
clean water to everyone. This project will focus on the development and design of a prototype which is able to extract 
harmful chemicals from greywater for it to be better suited for reuse. This product will use a filter system to remove 
harmful chemical substances from greywater and then reclaim this greywater later for use in laundry, car washing, 
and other domestic purposes. The type of material and filters that are going to be adapted will depend on the chemical 
composition of greywater which will be reviewed later on in the project.  
 
Water filtration, which has been used since 4000 years ago, is an important part of the water treatment process that

5. Conclusion 
Design and development of a grey water filter model has been conducted in this paper. From the Pugh matrix employed 
in this paper, the presented design demonstrated better features that are greater than the existing concept. Therefore, 
this concept is good and suitable for application in water filtration. Looking ahead, we propose construction and testing 
of the new model particularly using domestic wastewater generated from kitchen sinks, bathroom tubs and showers 
and waste water from washing machines.

Abstract 
 
Population growth and climate change increasingly threatens water security in rural areas of South Africa such as 
in Limpopo province. The severe drought experienced by Limpopo province also impacted the agricultural sector 
hence resulting in reduced food security. Polokwane District depends on the Olifants River to get water, other 
areas depend on stored water in dams, borehole water and rain harvesting. This study examines household 
consumption behaviors and knowledge of Limpopo water saving policies. The study used surveys and interviews 
to collect data from 4 villages namely Kgopaneng, Makubu, Malokela and Ga-Phala. A regression model was 
developed to analyze the data collected. The results show that while most rural households depend on ground 
water, they do not practice saving water policies. The results also show lack of education regarding reuse of 
domestic wastewater in agriculture. Recycling household water back to agricultural use was recommended. The 
study suggests water-saving policies such as reusing domestic water for irrigation in water-scarce communities.

1. Introduction  
Shortage of water is starting to be the cause of many problems in the world. The water demand continues to 
increase with increase in population. Urban development and expansion of business activities are contributing 
factors to the water shortage. At the same time climate change and drought also affect the water resources 
(Murwirapachena   2021). Water scarcity, poverty, and a high unemployment rate are the other problems that are 
currently facing Limpopo province in South Africa. This has affected majority of people’s ability to protect their 
living. Limpopo is South Africa’s food engine, approximately 33% of households in Limpopo are regarded as 
Agricultural households (PI & Mpandeli 2016). Water supply is a major concern in Limpopo province more 
especially in rural areas than Urban Areas (Matji M.P 2003). Schools, clinics, and households rely mainly on 
boreholes for water supply, rivers, and dams. It has been recognized that the health beneﬁts of improved water 
quality and increased water use (Nations 2015). A meta-analysis of the results of water supply interventions on 
diarrhoeal diseases among young children around the world found that improvements in water availability, 
improvement in water quality does reduce diarrhoea by 37% as shown in Figure 1 (Tamason  et al.2016)","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

It is notable that knowledge is responsible for the attitudes and behaviors towards water saving techniques. 
Knowledge sharing on water saving techniques is one of essential activity need to be done to affect the community 
behaviour. It is important to explore ways to encourage individuals to contribute to water saving techniques. 
providing water saving tips can induce behaviour change. It is highlighted by Timm and deal (2018) that it is 
essential to understand consumers beliefs, psychological element such as attitude and social norms before 
implementing more practicable water saving techniques (Timm & B, 2018). 
5. Conclusion 
The reuse of domestic water offers a promising solution for water conservation. The reuse of domestic water can 
in households and communities can significantly reduce water consumption, reduce reliance on portable water 
and minimize the environmental impact. Strategy for promoting water sustainability need to be implemented.

Abstract 
 
Rail-based transportation, such as Light Rail Transit (LRT), has emerged as an essential solution to address congestion 
issues and enhance mobility in urban areas. In this context, Palembang has recorded the fastest growth in transportation 
in Indonesia. Revenue from tickets (farebox) contributes significantly. However, the financial sustainability of LRT 
can be explored and enhanced from the potential for non-farebox revenue, which includes advertising, rental of 
commercial spaces, and collaboration with the private sector. This study indicates that utilizing existing assets can 
develop a business model, such as additional income streams. Strategies for optimizing non-farebox revenue around 
LRT stations through space rentals, advertising, and partnerships with small and medium enterprises (UMKM) must 
be considered to maintain affordable fares while ensuring service quality. Although Palembang's LRT revenue still 
relies on ticket sales, developing businesses and utilizing assets around the stations are necessary steps to diversify 
revenue sources. Implementing e-commerce business models in the transportation sector also offers significant 
potential to enhance non-farebox revenue. This research is expected to provide deep insights and recommendations 
for LRT management and local government in optimizing revenue sources and improving.. the public transportation 
user experience in South Sumatra.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1. Background  
Transportation based on rail, such as Light Rail Transit (LRT), has become essential in overcoming the congestion 
problem and increasing mobility in urban areas. Wiraguna (2020) stated that transport in Palembang City has grown 
fastest in Indonesia. LRT in Palembang seeks other income from tickets (farebox), such as potential non-farebox 
revenue, which includes various source income that does not originate from selling Tickets like advertising, and rental 
commercial rooms. Collaboration with the private sector is very significant and should be explored further.  Non-
farebox revenue is key to the sustainable financial system of public transportation. The Palembang’s LRT can develop 
a business model to earn additional income from advertising, rental space, and other commercial services, from 
utilizing the existing assets. Nurnadhifa and Latifah (2021)) stated that reinforcement of non-farebox revenue through","Proceedings of the 6th African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Current account interest income shows a positive trend with a significant spike in 2024. To maintain this growth, it is 
important to continue to manage funds wisely and seek more profitable investment opportunities. Optimizing current 
account balances will also help increase overall non-farebox income. 
 
Figure 1. Income from nonfarebox edutourism 
Revenue from educational tourism shows significant fluctuations, with a spike in 2023 followed by a decline in 2024. 
To overcome this decline, it is important to evaluate and update educational tourism programs, increase promotions, 
and consider collaboration with schools or educational institutions to attract more participants. 
 
3.5 Recommended Strategy to increase non-farebox revenue. 
In an effort to maximize the potential of non-farebox revenue, it is important to formulate effective and innovative 
strategies. Strategy recommendations are designed to increase non-farebox revenue. By considering existing data 
analysis and market trends. 
a. Situation and Needs Analysis 
• Conduct an in-depth study of market needs and potential non-farebox revenue. 
• Identify types of non-farebox revenue that can be implemented, such as advertising, space rental, and 
partnerships with MSMEs. 
b. Strategic Plan Development 
• Prepare a strategic plan for non-farebox revenue, including goals, objectives, and success indicators. 
• Integrate input from stakeholders, including local governments, MRT managers, and industry players. 
c. Infrastructure Improvement 
• Build or renovate commercial areas at stations to attract tenants and advertisers. 
• Provide supporting facilities, such as free Wi-Fi access and comfortable spaces for visitors. 
d. Partnerships and Cooperation

• Increase transparency of information regarding services offered through websites and social media. 
 
4.  Conclusion 
Potential for developing non-farebox revenues on the South Sumatra LRT, which is an important aspect for the 
financial sustainability of the public transportation system. Although farebox revenues are still the main source, there 
are significant opportunities for revenue diversification through advertising, commercial space rentals, and 
collaboration with the private sector, including MSMEs. 
Utilization of space at stations and infrastructure improvements can attract more tenants and advertisers. In addition, 
cooperation with various parties and the implementation of aggressive marketing strategies are essential to increase 
public awareness of LRT services. 
Implementing best practices from other transportation systems, as well as considering applicable regulations, the 
Palembang LRT can optimize non-farebox revenues.

Abstract  
 
Our research introduces a transformative approach to agricultural supply network fortification using the Decision 
Boundary Mapping (DBM) technique. While sustainable farming networks have received increasing attention, 
existing frameworks often struggle to extract actionable intelligence from complex environmental and logistical 
variables. To address this limitation, we developed the Adaptive DBM protocol, which systematically maps decision 
boundaries across dynamically selected parameter spaces. This methodology enables precise identification of 
vulnerability patterns within interconnected food systems. Analyzing 8,756 crop distribution records from the 
Regional Food Security Database, we uncovered four critical failure modes affecting harvest-to-market timelines. 
Most significantly, crops harvested during high humidity periods (>75%) and transported through regions with limited 
cold storage infrastructure experienced 42% higher spoilage rates than baseline. Additional patterns highlighted the 
crucial interplay between seasonal variations, transportation infrastructure, producer size, and regional climate factors. 
The adaptive parameter selection process yielded substantially more nuanced insights than conventional analytical 
approaches. From these findings, we developed targeted intervention strategies tailored to each vulnerability pattern, 
creating a direct pathway from data-driven insight to practical implementation. This work advances both 
methodological frameworks and practical applications in agricultural resilience.

Abstract 
 
As cities across the Global South struggle with rapid urbanization, socio-economic inequality, and infrastructural 
deficits, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising catalyst for urban transformation. This paper presents 
a comprehensive examination of AI-Driven Urban Transformation: A Framework for Smart and Inclusive Cities in 
the Global South. Through a combined narrative and systematic literature review of peer-reviewed sources, the study 
explores the intersection of AI technologies, smart city initiatives, and inclusive urban development. Key themes 
include digital infrastructure, AI governance, citizen participation, data ethics, and socio-economic equity. While AI-
powered systems have demonstrated potential in optimizing urban services, such as transportation, energy 
management, and public safety, their implementation often remains uneven and constrained by infrastructural and 
institutional gaps. The analysis reveals a pronounced digital divide, limited participatory mechanisms, and fragmented 
policy environments that challenge inclusive deployment. Nonetheless, successful case studies illustrate the 
importance of locally adapted, people-centered approaches that integrate ethical oversight and community 
engagement. This paper argues for a paradigm shift toward ""Southern smart urbanism,"" where AI-driven innovation 
is aligned with developmental priorities, social justice, and context-specific governance. It concludes by identifying 
key research gaps and proposing a multidimensional framework to guide future studies and policy interventions, 
thereby ensuring that AI becomes a tool not only for efficiency but for equity in urban futures.

Abstract 
 
Airport operations are becoming increasingly complex due to rapid technological advancements and the growing 
demand for air travel. This complexity necessitates airports to manage their assets optimally, and one of the critical 
assets is contact gates. Inefficient gate assignments can lead to significant disruptions, including passenger discomfort 
passengers, flight delays, and challenges for airlines in maintaining flight schedules. To address these issues, this study 
introduces an optimization model aimed at improving gate assignments while considering the maintenance status of 
Pre-Conditioned Air (PCA) systems. The model focuses on assigning gates based on their PCA status to reduce the 
wear effect on equipment and ensure adequate maintenance scheduling. A case study at King Abdulaziz International 
Airport (KAIA) was applied to over 800 flights and 76 gates to verify the effectiveness of the model. The results 
demonstrated improvements in contact gate utilization, with all flights assigned to contact gates. Furthermore, more 
than 45.6% of flights were assigned to gates with good PCA status, although only 17.4% of gates were in good 
condition. To further analyze the model, the flights of an airline representing 47.8% of KAIA’s flights were 
benchmarked with their baseline assignment, and the results showed a 3% increase in contact gate assignment. 
Additionally, since gates with poor PCA status require an Air Conditioning Unit (ACU) rental at an additional cost, 
optimizing the assignment to prioritize gates with good PCA status significantly reduced the ACU rental costs by 
94.03%.
