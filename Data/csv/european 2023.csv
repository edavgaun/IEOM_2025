Abstract 
With the ubiquity of Augmented Reality (AR) technology, the behavior of mobile social media users is changed, and 
more users tend to use it daily. The trend of using AR filters is emerging, and the value of the AR market has kept 
increasing in recent years. Along with the growth of social commerce, marketing managers have started investing in 
AR technology like AR Filter to achieve the company's marketing goals and objectives. Hence, this research study the 
factors affecting the behavioral intention of AR Filter users in the Hong Kong catering industry to provide implications 
for marketing managers and AR Filter developers. A hypothesis model is formulated to investigate the relationship 
between the perceived value of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Satisfaction-Loyalty Model and 
the effect on the behavioral intention of AR Filter users. The determinants of the perceived value of TAM are also 
studied to find out the factors affecting AR Filter users' behavioral intention to provide implications for the developers 
to create a better AR experience for the users. Questionnaire research is conducted, and the Structural Equation Model 
(SEM) approach is adopted to investigate the relationship between the constructs.

Conclusion 
The research unveils the effect of the external perception attributes on perceived values and hence customer fulfilments 
is supported. There is significant effect from all the external perception values included in this study including color, 
usability, and aesthetics on both perceived usefulness as well as perceived ease of use. It also illustrates the mechanism 
in enriching web usability through the deployment of vision tracking experiment. There is strong prove in 
demonstrating customers from online fashion store are focusing on the above-mentioned external perception. Among 
the external perception values constructs, aesthetics has the most significant effect towards the perceived value of 
users. Indeed, aesthetics is a critical element among the three external perception attributes for customers in feeling 
comfort and foster their experience in online shopping. The effect of perceived values on customer fulfilments are 
also being supported. Particularly, the effect of perceived ease of use is a compelling anterior on customer fulfilments 
in which there is compelling indirect effect caused by satisfaction towards loyalty in enhancing the revisit and 
repurchase decision of customers. It is found that more and more online fashion retail store start to target on the 
website/ application design with the consideration of the three chief external attributes of color, usability, and 
aesthetics in enhancing the user experience of the browsing and shopping in enhancing customer loyalty due to the 
rapid development and the intense competitive environment of e-commence while the study demonstrate that the three 
external perception attributes have positive significant effect towards both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of 
use and hence affecting the customers loyalty.  
 
The outcome from the research could help the enterprise especially for fashion retailing industry in evaluating the 
deploying user experience design their website/ application interface in fulfilling customers’ needs and more 
importantly, attracting customers to ensure sustainable business growth. The future research should deploy a larger 
sampling size for the sake of enhancing the representative of the analysis and the fitness of the model in generating 
result with higher significance. Besides, this study is only limited to respondents in Hong Kong while the future 
research should also attempt the investigation from different market segments or geographical locations for multiple 
group analysis, for instance, customers between traditional fashion stores and fast fashion stores or customers from 
different countries/ regions, to make the study more favorable in comparing the difference of consumers from different 
markets and identifying the uniqueness of the customers each single market segment or location. The future study 
could also reinforce the constructs in exploring if there is any other positive significant relationship of user experience 
design attributes on customer fulfilment to let business in understanding more in defining their website interface with 
the achievement of diverse business objectives.

Abstract 
A sustainable measurement of human body dimensions is of high interest. With the significant growth of fashion 
industry, a perfect fit of measurement is highly expected. Though conventional anthropometry is still relevant and 
convenient, the preciseness and consistency of measurement is challenged. Hence, a more robust and quicker 
anthropometric measurement has been proposed. It is through 3D-based anthropometric measurement taking into 
account what the user needs and expects. Basically, numerous common-sense issues emerge within the large-
scale utilize of electronic imaging frameworks, such as the choice of filter pose and robotized extraction of exact and 
reproducible estimations, without causing pointless inconvenience to the users. The essential focus of this work 
was in this manner to explore a strategy appropriate for large-scale surveying; to highlight particular issues of 
comparing 3D-based and manual anthropometric strategies; and to present this data within the real practices. This 
study involved 15 young females, their body dimensions were measured, both by the 3D-based and the traditional 
hand methods. There were 36 standard body dimensions compared. Statistically, it can be concluded that most body 
dimensions were deemed to be insignificantly different. Nevertheless, this study underpins a great communication 
bridge between clients and creators through the 3D virtual clothing process. The engineers and designers 
can effectively express their plan motivation by making a virtual clothing set so that they do not got to spend 
a parcel of vitality and cash to realize the physical sets. In terms of long-term orientation, the virtual 3D-based 
anthropometry supports the principles of sustainability especially the issue on environmentally friendly 
initiatives. Without a doubt, it underpins the commitment of Indonesian anthropometry updates.

Abstract 
This paper will compare and analyze an Electrically Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) and Interior Permanent 
Magnet (IPM) machines for an electric vehicle application based on Volkwagen ID.3 2020. The Torque and Power 
performances of EESM can be improved in wide range of speed with the same machine size and power inverter 
in compared with the IPM machine. Efficiency maps of both machines are obtained and compared with iron losses 
calculated by finite element analyses. It shows that the EE machine can be a low-cost alternative to the IPM 
machine with slightly lower efficiency and maximum torque. Due to its adjustable excitation, the EE machine is 
able to achieve a wider constant power speed range than the IPM machine. However, the efficiency of the EE 
machine is not better than the IPM machine in the high-speed region, since flux weakening control via armature 
windings is still necessary. 
This paper also presents a detailed design of three-phase interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motors 
Electrically Excited Synchronous Motor (EESM) with minimum weight, and maximum power output for a wide 
constant-power range. The stator and rotor geometry of the two motors with several variables and constraints has 
been implemented to evaluate electromagnetic performances. The proposed motor design is based on both 
analytical models and special software to determine the magnetic sizes and geometry parameters of the stator and 
rotor. The experimental test and analytical results have been used to evaluate silicon steel material for designs.

Introduction 
The Electrically Excited synchronous motor (EESM) and interior permanent magnet motor (IPM) are proven by 
their nature to be promising options for use in an electric vehicle traction motor. This research focused on 
developing Electrically Excited synchronous motor (EESM) based on Interior Permanent Magnet Motor-IPM 
Motor Volkwagen ID.3 2020. The IPM motors built with magnets placed inside the rotor body are attracting great 
attention in several variable-speed applications, such as electric vehicles and industrial and domestic appliances, 
where the most challenging requirement are high efﬁciency, high torque density, good overload capability, and 
extended speed range. The performance of IPM machines is significantly affected by the magnet rotor topologies 
in Chen Peng 2021, Wenliang Zhao 2015. Thus, several Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Design 
Trend are developing different topology rotor designs such as V-shaped from manufacturer Tesla; double V 
magnet shape from manufacturer China, delta shape from manufacturer AVL, hybrid delta shape based on the V 
shape from both manufacturer Tesla and manufacturer Nissan; hybrid double V shape from both manufacturer T 
and manufacturer V. Those design of rotor shape have aimed to maximize efﬁciency, torque density, overload load 
capability Chen Peng 2021, Wenliang Zhao 2015, Yang, Y 2017. However, this study will focus on comparing

Fig 8 shows that the maximum efficiency map of torque vs speed of the EESM is bigger than the IPM. With an 
efficiency of 96%, the maximum torque is 260Nm@5000rpm in EESM compared with 140N.m@5500 rpm. 
Especially, average torque values of EESM and IPM is 75N.m and 40 N.m at a maximum speed of 20.000 rpm  
Conclusions 
This paper has analyzed and compared torque, power and efficiency of a 3-phase 48-slot and 8-pole EESM and 
IPM motors for EV applications. The torque, power, and efficiency under peak torque performance and short 
overload have been measured at a maximum speed of 20000 rpm. A significant contribution of this study is to 
figure out EESM efficiency map improving in wide range speed in comparison with IPM motor 150kW for EV 
applications.

Abstract 
Failure of critical industrial equipment can have high stake negative impacts for industrial operations. Systematic 
preventive maintenance is a widely used technique to assess the condition of such equipment, including its 
potential failure. However, carrying out regular shutdowns on a critical equipment for inspections incur costs and 
potential production losses during the downtime period. Consequently, detection devices, such as sensors, are 
often used for monitoring the condition of critical equipment. These sensors can issue early warnings upon the 
occurrence of functional failures in the protected equipment or even anticipate potential failures. Promptly action 
can then be carried out to repair or replace the failed critical equipment to mitigate its consequences. 
Failure detection sensors are not immune to their own failures though. Sometimes, the functional failure of the 
sensor is immediately detected, other times it remains hidden and goes unnoticed until it manifests through more 
serious consequences, such as a breakdown in the protected equipment, which can lead to long recovery times 
and significant repair costs. Therefore, it is essential to periodically inspect the proper functioning of condition 
monitoring sensors to uncover any hidden failures, namely through in-place or laboratory testing. 
This study presents an economic optimization approach, using a discrete-event Monte Carlo simulation method 
implemented in a Microsoft Excel application, to determine the optimal inspection periodicity for sensors subject 
to hidden failures. Each simulation run computes the equivalent uniform periodic cost for any inspection period 
for the sensor, considering the following inputs: inspection cost and time, probability distributions for failure times 
of the equipment and sensor, repair costs and times, and the reactivation cost and time following a system failure. 
From these inputs, the optimal inspection period is determined by running multiple simulations for varying regular 
inspection periods and selecting as optimal the one that minimizes the expected equivalent uniform periodic cost 
of the system. 
The approach was developed specifically for the major Portuguese electric utilities company, replacing previously 
used empirical formulas that did not factor in economic costs. The application of the methodology is supported 
by a user-friendly interface implemented in Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications and illustrated 
through a case study. The decision support system facilitates the selection of the economically optimal inspection 
period for the sensor based on its expected equivalent uniform periodic cost. Furthermore, it provides additional 
descriptive statistics on the expected performance of the system, including availability and reliability metrics. The 
optimization-simulation approach presented in this article provides significant advantages over common 
analytical methods, which often rely on unrealistic simplifying assumptions, particularly for modeling complex 
maintenance systems. Overall, it proves to be a valuable contribution to the maintenance literature for making 
informed decisions regarding the definition of regular inspection periods for sensors with hidden failures while 
monitoring the condition of critical industrial equipment.

Abstract 
Innovators who can develop high quality products fast and at low cost command a significant competitive 
advantage.  However, they face uncertainty about (a) product development cost, time, and outcome, and (b) emergence 
of competing products.  While better products attract more customers, developing them may cost more and take 
longer, increasing the risk that competing products may emerge and take away market share.  Innovators must consider 
these uncertainties and tradeoffs in determining their optimal innovation strategies. Socially optimal innovation 
depends upon the number of innovators, and whether they compete or cooperate. This paper models innovation as a 
two-person optimal stopping game to analyze these issues.

Abstract 
The IPM motors built with magnets placed inside the rotor body are attracting great attention in several variable-
speed applications, such as electric vehicles and industrial and domestic appliances, where the most challenging 
requirement are high efﬁciency, high torque density, good overload capability, and extended speed range. This 
paper will develop A novel hybrid multi objective optimization method which combines the Taguchi method with 
different rotor pole topologies  for optimization of interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs). 
This method is capable to pre-optimize rotor pole topology and given multi objective optimization problem 
compared with the conventional IPM. The method is applied to maximize the power density and the efficiency of 
an IPMSM under constraints. In the optimization process, the power density of the IPMSM is significantly 
improved and the volume of the IPMSM is minimized. However this method can improve the efficiency while 
increasing the power density. Finally, a rotor lamination prototype is manufactured to verify the feasibility of this 
method.

Introduction  
Interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs) have been extensively adopted in electric and hybrid 
electric vehicles due to high torque density and desirable high efficiency.  The performance of IPM machines is 
significantly affected by the magnet rotor topologies in Chen Peng 2021, Wenliang Zhao 2015. Thus, several 
Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Design Trend are developing different topology rotor designs such 
as V-shaped from manufacturer Tesla; double V magnet shape from manufacturer China, delta shape from 
manufacturer AVL, hybrid delta shape based on the V shape from both manufacturer Tesla and manufacturer 
Nissan; hybrid double V shape from both manufacturer T and manufacturer V. Those design of rotor shape have 
aimed to maximize efﬁciency, torque density, overload load capability Chen Peng 2021, Wenliang Zhao 2015, 
Yang, Y 2017. However, this study will focus on comparing power, torque and efficiency maps of IPM 150kW. 
This study will improve average torque current characteristic by hybrid rotor shape design and step skewing 
magnet segment. The Torque and power vs current of the IPM step-skew magnet rotor are simulated to verify by 
FEA method.  Many researches have been done for the optimization method for IPM EV applications, Kriging 
model is a one of popular method for optimization owing to its advantage which can predict surface of objective 
function through exploiting the spatial correlation of data which only based on limited information .  
However, the Kriging model with higher precision requires more interpolation points that increase the number of 
finite element analysis (FEA) calculations, thus the computation time is overload. Therefore, it becomes a focus 
problem to reduce the computation cost. In Taguchi method was developed the pre-optimization to reduce the 
optimization variables, then Kriging model is created based on the FEA, and this method can sharply reduce the 
FEA calculations due to the number of variables decreases. In the Kriging method is used to approximate the 
extracted variables to reduce FEA calculations. Other methods have improved efficiency of optimization process 
by reducing iteration . All these literatures have tried to reduce the computation time. Especially, the dimension of 
parameters is large, and the number is larger than 8, the computation load is still large. Therefore, in the process 
of a multi-objective optimization with large parameter dimension, After the above analysis, a novel hybrid multi‐
objective optimization method combining Taguchi method with multi‐level Kriging model is proposed in this 
paper. The proposed multi‐objective optimization method is adopted to optimize an IPMSM used in electric 
vehicles.

Back EMF waveforms of simulations and measured results are shown in Figure 9. One circle of back EMF was 
measured by Oscilloscope and recorded in data files for plotting those curves. 
 4. Conclusions 
This paper presents the shape optimization of a IPM using a Multistep optimization method. To maximize the 
performance of the IPM, the average torque, torque ripple, DC link voltage and Radial forces were set as the multi-
objective function, and efficiency and torque ripple were set as constraints. FEA was used to improve the accuracy 
of the design results. As a result of the parametric study, the lower bar, and rib thickness magnet angle parameters 
were determined to be design variables. The result of optimization shows the efficiency of the entire approach. 
The analytical model and the optimization program are both implemented using MATLAB which makes it easier 
to use. To validate if the suggested motor truly meets the requirements and boundaries, results are verified using 
FEM which is also controlled via MATLAB and will be initiated automatically after optimization. The technique 
of SSR is an efficient way to improve the performance of the motor as a technique of skewing slot. A hybrid 
genetic algorithm (HGA), which combined a genetic algorithm (GA) with the Taguchi method, is proposed to 
optimize the rotor structure of an IPMSM for an electric vehicle application, to maximize the torque and efficiency, 
and minimize the torque ripple and iron losses.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on the Electromagnetic Design of Synchronous Reluctance Motors for Electric Vehicle 
Considering Loss Minimization with the saturation effect (saturated case) and rotor ploes. The SynRM is 
considered as a special case of the interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) without permanent 
magnet excitation. The paper presents an analysis of the performance of an electrical machine used for electric 
traction in automotive applications. The machine under study is a 8-pole, 72-slot SynRM. The study includes 
analytical analysis using the SPEED program and numerical analysis to obtain the performance of the proposed 
machine. The geometry parameter optimization of the machine is also presented in detail and analyzed. 
Keywords:  Synchronous Reluctances Machine-SynRM, Traction motors, Electric vehicle, Torque ripple,

1. Introduction
The synchronous reluctance machine (SynRM) is very similar to other induction and permanent magnet assistant 
machines. The main differences are the rotor topolgies of flux barriers or pole shape desiges. Contrary to the rotor 
of other machines, there is no conduction or permanent magnet on the rotor of the SynRM therefore optimal rotor 
design is the most important factor. Various rotor configurations with multi layer U and V shapes have influences 
on electromagnetic performances in M. Ferrari,  2015, X. Y. Zhu 2017, W. Wang2015. For electric vehicle 
application, the most important parameters of this machine is the provided torque of SynRM, which is dependent 
on the inductance difference between d- and q- axis and saliency ratio, respectively in N. Bianchi, 2018. This 
parameter can be improved by optimizing the geometrical parameters of the rotor and stator of SynRM and the 
combination of slots/number of poles. Another important parameter is speed in the context of the major drawback 
of the SynRm, the ribs and bridges areas of the rotor would fail because of the high centrifugal forces. The 
solutions to increase the maximum speed of the SynRM are: change the thickness value of ribs and bridges (strong 
influence in torque value), fill the barriers with non magnetic materials with high Young's Module value, involving 
non-magnetic rings mounted in the air-gap, non magnetic insertions in the barriers, increasing the number of ribs, 
all showing a good potential without technological constraints. The paper will develop the analytical bases 
software SPEED and finite elements method (Flux 2D) in order to study the influence of different parameters of 
the rotor on the machine performances. In order to obtain the best performances (torque ripple, efficiency) and 
one control strategy are detailed in this paper. 
2. Analytical Design of SynRM
Electromagnetic torque has been calculated based on the stator, rotor diameter, and power inverter voltage and 
currents. The electromagnetic parameters can inertial calculated as:

4. Conclusion 
This paper presents the shape optimization of a SynRM using multi optimization of geometry parameters of rotor 
poles. To maximize the performance of the SYNRM, the average torque, torque ripple was set as the multi-
objective function, and efficiency and torque ripple were set as constraints. FEM was used to improve the accuracy 
of the design results. Efficiency was performed based on changes of the design variables. As a result of the 
parametric study, the layer thickness, rib thickness, stator depth and with parameters were determined to be design 
variables. The result of optimization shows the efficiency of the entire approach. The influence of stator slot/pole 
number combinations in average value of torque and torque ripples has been investigated in this paper. The 
configuration with 27 slots and four layer flux-barrier has the lowest torque ripple. Also this configuration has 
been numerically evaluated, and the obtained performances has presented in this paper. In continuous power the 
efficiency is 95% and in peak power condition is 90% at rated speed.

Abstract 
This work presents two Mixed-Integer Linear Programming models to solve a pickup and delivery problem from a 
Portuguese company. The objective is to determine the minimum travel time for the pickup and delivery of 
manufacturing tools of the Manufacturing Tool Repair support service, of this company. The contribution of this work 
involves the presentation of two three-index mathematical models. Those models reflect the integration of the 
Simultaneous Delivery and Pickup Problem, with the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. The 
two mixed-integer linear model formulations are presented and used to solve the problem using several real-world test 
instances. It is also compared their performance using some benchmark instances, proving its feasibility and 
comparing its behavior.

1. Introduction
Organizations are continuously looking for new ways to improve their efficiency. However, the services that support 
the value chain are normally overlooked and sometimes a great opportunity for improvement is lost.  
The present work aims to improve the efficiency of a Portuguese automotive factory, by increasing the efficiency of 
the production support services, in particularly, the Manufacturing Tool Repair (MTR) support service. The workers 
of the MTR service are responsible for the repair and calibration of the tools used in the machines that produce the 
company’s products. However, before repairing and calibrating, the workers need to pickup the used tools from the 
production lines, and after repair, deliver them to the production lines. Since no production line must stop due to lack 
of manufacturing tools, and currently there is no real-time information of the tools’ availability in the lines, the MTR 
workers need to constantly go to the shopfloor to check the tools’ stock levels. This results in 30% of the total working 
time being allocated to transport activities, which are considered non-value adding for this service. 
Due to the applicability of the VRP in real-world situations, and the fact that it is classified as an NP-hard problem, 
extensive research has been made to optimize it (Kumar & Panneerselvam  2012). When considering time windows 
constraints and the simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (P&D) a variant of the VRP, the VRPSDPTW is obtained. In 
this problem, every single customer may be, simultaneously, a pickup and delivery customer. Moreover, the delivering 
and picking service must be done within pre-defined time windows. 
Zhang et al. (2020) applied two different approaches to solve the HVRPSPDTW with multiple depots: an exact and a 
metaheuristic approach. For the first, they solved a mixed-integer non-linear programming model using the software 
CPLEX, and for the latter they used a combination between the Parallel Differential Evolutionary algorithm and the

The instances are symmetric and are grouped in clustered customers (IC type), uniformly distributed customers (IR 
type) and a mix of IC and IR types. As can be seen in Table 3 and like in the real problems (presented in Table 1 and 
Table 2), the results in terms of solution GAP obtained with V-F model are slightly worse than the C-F model. The 
procedure based on V-F model provides the fastest running times since the CPU time is rather lower (55% on average) 
than the CPU time of the C-F model. For the IRC problems (more complex instances), the optimal solution was not 
achieved for the last two instances, within the time limit pre-established. And only one instance was solved optimality 
with the two models, the IC201.

5. Conclusions 
The main idea started with the need to improve the MTR support service’s efficiency of a Portuguese company. This 
service is one of the most time-consuming activities because it consists of delivering and collecting the manufacturing 
tools, from the MTR workshop to the production lines and vice-versa.  
 
To focus on improving this distribution process, it was proposed to develop and implement a support system that 
informs workers when to do a P&D route, according to the tools needed for production and the tools available for 
collection. The data related to what tools were available for collection in the production lines and what tools were 
available for delivery in the MTR service is known. Every time that a P&D route must be done, we are facing a 
VRPSDPTW. Since the number of production lines, vehicles and tools is not very high, it was decided to solve this 
problem using a linear programming model. 
 
However, the need arose to test more than one approach, to validate its efficiency in terms of computational time and 
solutions. Hence the proposal presented in this paper to make a comparative study of the performance of two models: 
Vehicle-Flow model and the Commodity-flow model.  
 
With the two models, most of the real-world instances tested were solved optimality in a reduced computational time 
and good upper bounds could be generated for the remaining instances. 
The models were also tested, and its performance compared with the well-known benchmark tests for Li and Lim 
(2001). Even with these more complex and larger instances, the conclusions drawn for the real instances were the 
same. In conclusion, after the tests performed, the commodity-flow model has a better performance regarding 
computational times and GAP values, than the vehicle- flow model, being proven its efficiency.

Abstract 
Although the cost of plastic pallets is higher than wooden pallets, the plastic pallets can be highly reused 
and exported without fumigating. According to a report by Grand View Research, Inc. The global plastic 
pallets market is anticipated to grow by 5.2% per year from 2022 to 2030 and the market size is expected 
to reach USD 9.72 billion by 2030. This research deal with a case study of a plastic pallets manufacturing 
company in Taiwan. Due to the various product sizes, uncertain demand, long changeover time, limited 
inventory space, and so on, the case company needs a pragmatic approach to control the inventory level. 
According to the concept of ABC inventory management, the inventory policy of each class was suggested 
firstly. Traditionally, it is commonly seen that using increasing class sizes, such as 20%, 30%, and 50% to 
classify all inventory items. However, the policies will affect the batch sizes, average inventory, number of 
changeovers, and fill rate. Based on the limitation of the number of changeovers and inventory space 
limitation, a systematic procedure was proposed to classify all inventory items and maximize the fill rate. 
Finally, some experiments were tested to give suggestions to the case company.

Abstract 
A plethora of studies have been conducted to address sustainable product fulfillment. To facilitate the 
understanding, authors have published their review papers focusing on different issues, e.g., green product 
design approaches, decision support systems implemented in sustainable manufacturing, cross relationships 
between product attributes and consumer decision-making. Although these review papers potentially 
advance research on the respective issues or topics, an overview of the product life cycle stages in 
sustainable product fulfillment, which were the most frequently examined, is not seen. This study is to 
review the relevant literature, in attempting to identify these life cycle stages and further explore the relevant 
issues, such as the methodologies used, the sustainability dimensions (i.e., economic, environmental, and 
social) considered, and the industries involved. Based on a rigorous search and selection process, 114 papers 
were retained for analysis. As shown in the results, green consumption was the focus in 54 papers, thus 
being the most examined stage. It is unexpected to see that the end-of-life treatment stage was discussed in 
only 5 articles.  Regarding methodologies, quantitative research was the most frequently conducted, 
contributing to 65 papers. While a variety of industries was involved in the 114 papers, the automotive 
industry was the study background in 11 papers. Although achieving sustainability from all the three 
dimensions is very important, most of papers (79 out of 114) considered one or a combination of two 
dimensions. With the results and analysis, we further shed on the prospects, obstacles, and future directions 
in facilitating sustainable product fulfillment from all the three dimensions of sustainability.

Abstract 
Delivering value to the consumer, allocating orders, and cost-optimization are all functions that the retail distribution 
supply chain performs with growing importance. As a result, businesses must embrace a comprehensive perspective 
of the entire network. These requirements have driven the modeling of supply chain network design from a retail 
standpoint. The study considers a multi-echelon network with several manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and 
customers while developing a mathematical model to minimize total costs. In addition, it uses secondary data from a 
Small and Medium-sized Enterprise in Vietnam, called the SME to improve its network. The findings are used for 
strategic and operational decisions, such as determining the number of facilities needed, optimizing total distribution 
costs, as well as resulting in a need for a strategic alliance. To our knowledge, this empirical study is one of the efforts 
to provide the door for more research on the adoption of a retail distribution supply chain network design.

1. Introduction
1.1 Theoretical Background 
The Covid-19 epidemic is a notable example, which caused many retailers to experience supply shortages and demand 
increases never seen. It has never been more important to control supply and demand changes in retail distribution 
supply chains to create sustainable communities. Retailers, in fact, determine the pace of a distribution network and 
are crucial to community sustainability (Alikhani et al., 2019; Fernie & Sparks, 2014). Understanding how to design 
a retail distribution supply chain network has become a crucial problem (Alikhani et al., 2021; Ning & You, 2018). 
The Supply Chain Network Design (SCND) challenge requires making a variety of decisions, such as deciding the 
number, location, and capacity of facilities needed to deliver requested products to specific customers in a timely and 
cost-effective manner (Salehi Sadghiani et al., 2015).  
To deal with problems from several key research areas such as SCND, supply chain contracts,  logistics management, 
and production planning and scheduling, many mathematical models and algorithms are introduced such as mixed-
integer linear programming (Sadeghi et al., 2023; Salehi Sadghiani et al., 2015), mixed-integer non-linear 
programming (You & Grossmann, 2008), multi-objective programming, fuzzy programming (Kazancoglu et al., 2021; 
Badhotiya et al., 2019; Vimal et al., 2019; Jindal & Sangwan, 2014), and heuristics/metaheuristic algorithms 
(Feizollahi et al., 2021; You & Grossmann, 2008). For example, Jindal & Sangwan (2014) suggested a fuzzy mixed 
integer linear programming model to select each facility location and allocation of parts, as well as the number of parts 
to maximize the organizational profit. Sadeghi et al. (2023) proposed a mixed-integer linear formulation for a dynamic 
modified stochastic p-median problem in a competitive supply chain network design. Besides, several studies 
developed multi-objective programming for facility location, and other supply chain problems to determine the

6. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Research 
The study examines the SME operations in Vietnam by using the MILP method and CPLEX tool. The results are 
useful for the SME to consider strategic and operational decisions in the distribution network design, such as figuring 
out how many facilities are required and how to optimize total distribution costs. This SCND optimization model not 
only helps the SME at that time but also be applied in the future if the company focuses more on long-term strategies 
to develop effective strategic alliances to cope with customer demand changes. With the MILP method and CPLEX 
OPL solver, users will be exposed to a simple, easy-to-customized method and programming language. On the other 
hand, the MILP method will be more accessible for those with more work experience, they can model based on very 
practical constraints, and the giving outcomes are also as good as other methods. This paper not only confirms the 
effectiveness of the mathematical model in designing supply chain networks for the SME retail systems but also 
desires to introduce new methods and tools to small and medium-sized companies in Vietnam. 
Limitations and Future Research Direction 
Generally, many retail distribution companies in Vietnam, especially small and medium-sized companies, build a 
supply chain network based on experience when started their business. This caused uncontrollable implicit costs, time, 
and distance leading to order lasting, cost increases, etc. The SME is one such company, a mathematical model, and 
a technical tool to improve the business are needed. However, the model still has limitations, for example, the author 
should investigate more into business processes to modify and add more realistic and effective constraints, and other 
variables such as labor costs, as well as relevant data.  
Mathematically, if there are more constraints, the algorithm will be easier, and the program will produce faster, more 
optimal results. However, there is always a contradiction in the adoption of mathematical models for practical 
problems, therefore, there should be coordination between model builders and companies. In summary, future research 
is directed by limitations, in which more data analysis and consideration of both internal and external factors would 
improve the study.

Abstract 
“Port 4.0” is the concept of integrating advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain to enhance the overall efficiency of the port operations. “Port 4.0” has the potential 
to transform port operations, making them more secure, and environmentally sustainable. As “Port 4.0” is still at a 
nascent stage in the maritime industry, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of key 
technologies related to “Port 4.0”, their potential benefits and challenges and future trends and development. The 
findings indicates that the implementation of “Port 4.0” technologies can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and 
enhance competitiveness and while increasing supply chain transparency. However, challenges such as high 
implementation costs, system integration, cyber risks, and a lack of digital talent need to be addressed. Collaboration 
among port stakeholders was found to be critical in driving innovation and competitiveness. Policy responses and 
recommendations for future research were also presented.

Abstract 
Recent research on critical failure factors (CFFs) in ERP projects shows that the discovery and implementation of 
organizational processes are among the top seven main groups of CFFs. In this paper, a hybrid process mining and 
FMEA framework is presented to quantify the risk factors associated with process non-conformance. This approach 
is designed to increase the effectiveness of implementing ERP solutions in organizations, based on the identification 
and assessment of business process risks using the FMEA methodology. This study contributes by enhancing the BPM 
life cycle using process mining algorithms. To validate the proposed approach, a case study is conducted on the 
warehousing and logistics management process in one of the largest grain trading companies in Iran. The results of 
the research show that the use of the proposed approach can reduce the RPN of this process from 336 to 16 thus 
increasing the effectiveness of the ERP solution deployed.

reviewed in a joint meeting with the presence of organization experts and process owners. The extracted improvement 
suggestions are as follows: 
 It is suggested to carry out feasibility studies and loading times of various types of transport machines with different 
loading tonnages. Because with a more accurate estimate of the loading time, the recall notice can be registered 
on time. 
 By carrying out this process mining, it was found that the cancellation and override procedures can be recorded in 
a floating form and at different times. For this reason, it is recommended to redesign the traffic software to control 
cancellations in such a way that in case of override, only the exit from the parking lot is recorded. 
 Less than one percent of all cases that have been reworked were due to the mismatch of weight with traffic items 
during the investigation. According to this item, it is necessary to determine the final weight of the pallet. It is 
recommended to determine the final weight of the pallets using a scale and install the pallet weight specification 
label. In this case, the exact weight of each specific pallet and the amount of loading of each car is estimated based 
on this. 
 According to the results of the process compliance check in the seventh step and a case-by-case review of several 
traffic files in the traffic software, it was found that the registration of the time and date of the steps on the server 
is accompanied by an error. This has been caused because some steps executed correctly in reality, but the 
information has been recorded incorrectly and has created a variant in the process, which should be corrected by 
the company's software team. 
 Since the reason for the cancellation of vehicles cannot be reported, it is suggested that the traffic software be 
redesigned in such a way that the reason for the cancellation can be reported. 
Conclusion and Future Research 
After redesigning the warehousing and logistics management process using the proposed BPMPM framework and 
automating this process by traffic software, the results of the process mining and software logs show that the 
implementation of the compliance process is 76%. Also, after implementing the recommendations of the eighth step to 
calculate the effectiveness of the measures taken to reduce the risk of the warehouse and logistics management process, 
one more time the risk assessment of this process was done by the FMEA technique. 
As can be seen in Figure 13, performing corrective action for automation and error proofing of the process led to the 
improvement of probability number, detection factor, and RPN, and the risk of the process was classified in the low-
risk area. Considering the compliance of 76% and the new RPN number which is 16, the effectiveness of the redesign 
of the warehouse and logistics management process with the proposed BPMPM approach is evident, which led to the 
elimination of the possibility of leaving bulk goods without registering documents in the ERP system. This case greatly 
satisfied the stakeholders of the ERP system. As mentioned in the first part of this article, in ERP projects, problems 
related to the identification and implementation of organizational processes are one of the seven main groups of critical 
failure factors. The findings of the case study clearly show that the use of the proposed hybrid approach (BPMPM) 
based on risk management, knowledge of business process management, and the use of process mining solutions was 
able to reduce this risk and increase the effectiveness of the implemented ERP solution. 
In this research, due to the time-consuming nature of the case study, one process was studied, it is recommended to use 
the proposed method for other processes, such as the order to cash, purchase to pay, account payable, and accounts 
receivable. Also, the proposed approach was used after the implementation of the ERP solution, it is suggested that 
researchers in this field also check the performance of the proposed approach before the implementation of ERP.

Abstract 
Food insecurity is a problem that should not be overlooked in America. In 2022, about 1.3 billion people were food 
insecure, an increase of 10% from the previous year. Food deserts, an area with low income and low access to 
nutritious foods, can be characterized by 5A’s: availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, and 
acceptability. As more investments go into building infrastructure for population growth, the local food industry must 
expand for both current and new residents. One strategy to combat food deserts is to use the Internet and e-commerce 
like online food services can contribute to solving food insecurity. From Generation X to Millennials to Generation 
Z, the adoption of the Internet is rapid. However, these services have additional costs for the consumer. The goal of 
this research was to examine the current e-commerce solutions to food deserts in a local area and review the literature 
on how e-commerce can alleviate food deserts. Data were collected from published government and company sites. 
Results reveal Internet accessibility continues to be an issue for reliable e-commerce use. E-commerce can alleviate 
food deserts by reducing the cost for both consumers and businesses, accommodating various groups of people, and 
focusing on rural areas.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background 
Food insecurity is an economic and social condition of a household lacking adequate access to nutritious, healthy food 
access to adequate food, has become a large public health concern (USDA  2017). Studies have shown that food 
insecurity is associated with health conditions such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes (Dutko et al. 2012; Haskell, 
2022). Food insecurity is more profound in food deserts, areas where the nearest supermarket is more than one mile 
away in urban areas or ten miles away in rural areas (USDA  2023). Food deserts are in both urban and rural areas 
across the U.S. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that larger levels of poverty increase 
the likelihood of a food desert’s presence regardless of the area type, rural or urban (Dutko et al. 2012). People living 
in the food desert often need to do grocery shopping at gas stations or “mini-marts” where typically overpriced junk 
food is sold. 
The USDA measures food deserts using census tract, a subdivision of a county with a population between 1,000 and 
8,000 people. A census tract that has low income (The poverty rate is greater than or equal to 20 percent, or the median 
family income is less than 80 percent of the state median family income), low access (At least a third of census tract 
population lives greater than a mile from a supermarket and grocery store for urban areas or 10 miles for rural areas) 
is considered a food desert  (Ver Ploeg et al. 2011). There are food desert alternative definitions where the distance 
for urban tracts to a supermarket or grocery store is 0.5 miles instead of 1 mile, while a rural tract’s distance remains 
as 10 miles. A third definition is, while the urban tract distance remains at 1 mile, the rural tract distance is 20 miles.

Mecklenburg County. Since Mecklenburg County included mostly urban tracts the Internet infrastructure would be 
better than a county with more rural tracts. 
 
With ecommerce, consumers must consider additional costs like delivery and service fees along with their 
transportation costs and Internet bill. In total to use ecommerce in Mecklenburg County the consumer paid between 
$140 to $200 per month, depending on their situation. None of these costs could be covered by SNAP benefits. A way 
to reduce a consumer’s cost and increase usage of ecommerce services would be to add a monetary reserve in SNAP 
benefits specific to covering delivery and service fees. In addition, the government could make a policy which restricts 
the charges a SNAP participant is charged in fees. Delivery costs for food retailers depended on many factors, like 
demand density, proximity to intended delivery area and multitasking for delivery trucks. Delivery costs for a 
consumer were stable across Mecklenburg County census tracts because the burden of cost was on the food retailer. 
On the other hand, pick-up costs were not stable since a consumer had to travel a longer distance to reach their nearest 
store location. A consumer using their personal vehicle for pick-up was cheaper than using private transportation like 
Lyft. There are many routes to branch out in the research of food deserts and ecommerce. One potential study is an 
investigation in the Internet infrastructure and available food services in rural areas. Both factors, suggested by 
multiple studies, may indicate an underlying issue with the investing and policy for rural areas (USDA, 2019, Newing, 
2021). This study can properly define what acceptable Internet infrastructure is, like Internet speeds, Internet coverage, 
number of ISPs available, the type of equipment used to deliver Internet services, etc. 
 
Another investigation can be into the digital food desert, a local online market that mimics the conditions of a physical 
food desert and with poor Internet infrastructure. Like the previous future study mentioned, poor Internet infrastructure 
needs a more concrete definition. A question could be if this online market extends to convenience stores because they 
have moved toward online services and delivery. For example, CVS, Walgreens, and Dollar General all offer online 
shopping. Would there be such a case as a digital food swamp? Consumers have sensory and trust issues with 
purchasing fresh foods online. How does advertisement of unhealthy foods factor into these decisions? 
 
One last future study is investigating the scenarios that fluctuate the costs for consumers to use ecommerce services. 
The results of $140 to 200 for monthly cost in Mecklenburg County make a lot of assumptions. For example, the cost 
to operate a personal vehicle differs based on total miles driven per year, which the more miles driven, the cheaper 
per mile drive is. Certain cars cost more than others to operate because of differences in fuel costs, insurance costs, 
and maintenance costs. If a consumer uses Lyft for their transportation to pick up their food order, then they must 
consider price variations because of geographic location, current demand, number of available vehicles, etc. Another 
assumption is the number of orders per month is the same. How does a consumer’s order frequency change based on 
the time of year? What if a consumer orders more food during the summer when fuel costs are higher? One last 
assumption was ordering online food order assumed the total cost of Internet and mobile device. However, a consumer 
uses the Internet and their mobile device for multiple purposes and a future study would take this into account.

Abstract 
Although art plays a crucial role in socio-cultural development and sustainability, in today’s economic system, many 
artists struggle in maintaining their financial stability, and continuing their artistic productions and careers. Addressing 
this issue, the present research aims to promote the sustainable development of art industry by providing guidance and 
insights not only for artists, but also for the other industry stakeholders such as curators, gallery owners, collectors 
and art investors. With this aim, first, to understand artwork pricing dynamics, we review the supply chain 
relationships in art industry. Then, as a collaborative effort with a contemporary art gallery in Istanbul, we study the 
factors that have the potential to influence artwork prices by using correlation analysis and multiple moderated 
regression models. Unlike most of the previous studies that typically employ auction prices, we focus on the gallery 
prices of artworks, and analyze the joint impacts of both artist and artwork related factors that have not been studied 
yet. By interpreting the findings obtained from the analysis, we propose several data-driven strategies, especially for 
young and enterprising artists, enabling them to generate certain amount of income from their artworks, and thus 
improve their economic sustainability.

Abstract 
Maintenance remains one of the major concerns of the oil and gas industry. Recently, there has been an increasing 
drive to realise high maintenance efficiency following the various challenges faced in equipment and plant 
management. Considering these, this study proposes an I4.0 maturity or readiness model specifically tailored to assist 
the Oil & Gas upstream companies in reaching a higher level of I4.0 maturity in their condition-based maintenance 
approach, thereby improving the efficiency and reliability of equipment and productivity at large. The study presents 
a proposed validated maturity and readiness model that focuses on condition-based maintenance in the oil and gas 
sector, integrating I4.0 and some key dimensions (Organisation; People; Process, Operations and Maintenance; IT/IT 
Solutions; and Environmental Sustainability) and assessment scales (from 0 to 4) to determine readiness and maturity 
level. The proposed model developed from the existing literature is validated through a Delphi study using experts 
from academia and the Oil & Gas industry to review its content and suitability for practical application. The results of 
the Delphi approach offer the model and a tool that provides an opportunity to self-evaluate readiness to implement 
or integrate I4.0 into the condition-based maintenance strategy (I4.0-based CBM). Experts found the maturity model 
robust in its content, relevant, clear, and helpful for the pathway to I4.0 integration to CBM and adoption in the overall 
maintenance strategy of the oil and gas plant. Business leaders, maintenance heads, and plant managers with 
experience in the oil and gas upstream sector will find the model very suitable for the onward journey to I4.0 
integration in condition-based maintenance, especially in oil-rich developing nations where a facility was used as a 
case study. The proposed new I4.0 maturity model tailored to integrating I4.0 into CBM in the Oil & Gas (O&G) 
industry is essential to the body of knowledge and practice.

1. Introduction
This paper aims to present a finalised framework for implementing industry 4.0-based Condition-Based Maintenance 
(CBM) initiatives in the oil and gas sector. The framework results from extensive research, incorporating a theoretical 
foundation informed by literature and expert insights from a Delphi panel. Condition-based maintenance has proven 
to be an effective strategy encompassing repairs, inspections, and verifications. At present, there is a conspicuous 
absence of industry-specific frameworks and models for implementing Industry 4.0-based Condition-Based

three most important dimensions for integrating Industry 4.0 into CBM, echoing the viewpoints of numerous scholars 
in the existing literature. 
While consensus was reached regarding all facets of the implementation procedure for the framework, Industry 4.0 
Maturity Model and assessment tool, several opportunities for improvement were identified through the qualitative 
feedback. Consequently, these enhancements were integrated into the Maturity Model and Framework, leading to a 
more robust Industry 4.0 maturity assessment for CBM and fostering more effective integration of Industry 4.0 into 
CBM for optimal improvement in plant equipment performance and reliability. 
A summary of the Delphi study findings and the executed improvements was shared with the Delphi panel participants. 
All participants acknowledged these modifications, affirmed the study's outcomes, and enabled the conceptual 
framework's verification and initial validation.

Abstract 
In the process of training and examining professional drivers who serve as commercial trucks and coaches’ drivers, 
studying the willingness of taking training courses is a crucial concern for transport authorities for developing training 
programs on transportation. To this purpose, an adapted version of the statistical method of Kolmogorov-Smirnov, 
three sample, has been utilized to investigate the similarity of distribution functions for three types of drivers who 
receive permission with taking training courses and examinations, taking examinations without training courses, and 
receiving permissions without examination and training courses. Data, for those received permissions across the West-
Asian country of Iran, has been collected for a year through the system used for issuing drivers’ permissions for 
commercial transportation followed by categorizing into thirty-one provinces and analysis. The results revealed that 
their distribution functions are different for three types of drivers over the provinces. Therefore, transport authorities 
should design driver’s exams and training courses different province to province.

Introduction 
Compliance with laws is one of the most prominent manifestations of civic rights in the social sphere nowadays 
(Nwagwu et al. 2020). This commitment is discussed in various fields, some of which are neglected in certain areas 
such as transportation, leading to traffic violations (Ako2019). One of the major contributors to traffic issues and 
accidents across all communities is driving offenses that believed that is preventable if drivers are under 
comprehensive and efficient training courses (Gichaga2017). The prevalence of such offenses differs based on the 
cultural, social, economic, and geographic characteristics of each society (Kelacha2021). While various 
environmental, regulatory, and enforcement factors contribute to driving offenses, human factors are considered to be 
the main cause (Lee and Al-Mansour2020). The identification of human factors and the use of education to address 
and improve driving behaviors have been found to play a significant role in preventing and managing traffic accidents, 
according to studies conducted in developed countries (Nancy2021). So, the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for 
Road Safety places emphasis on the driver as a crucial element in their approach to reducing driving-related accidents 
and injuries worldwide (Timmermans et al. 2020). Education is additionally acknowledged as a sustainable 
competitive advantage for enhancing the awareness and skills of the workforce in modern times (Farooq and Juhasz 
2020), so in terms of road safety, providing driver education is regarded as the topmost priority for investment in 
human capital (Timmermans et al. 2019). One of the important concerns of transportation authorities who are dealing 
with developing training programs for commercial drivers is to study their inclination toward taking training courses. 
This is because the effectiveness of training programs depends on the individual’s willingness to engage in the 
activities and follow the guidelines provided in this regard (Nwakaire and Kobani 2022). Therefore, managing the 
training process and developing driver education programs require careful consideration of individuals’ motivations

Figure 1: Difference between cumulative proportions of drivers without exams, take exams and take training courses 
 
Conclusion 
 
Since in the process of managing training courses for commercial drivers, it is necessary to investigate more on the 
distribution function of willingness to take examination and training courses by drivers who are willing to serve as 
commercial drivers. The overall concept behind the research work is to check the similarity between the drivers who 
received commercial certificates without taking exams, training courses and exams, and eventually exams without 
training courses. Data for all types of drivers have been collected in each province and the well-known goodness of 
fit test of Kolmogorov-Smirnov in its three sample format has been utilized to check if their distribution functions are 
the same or different. The results revealed that their distribution functions are different. It means that transport 
authorities should differently design exams and training across the courses where they should be designed different 
province to province. Further research in this field is recommended to focus more on specific measures such as the 
rate of acceptance for drivers who were participating in examinations and taking training courses and without training 
courses. Transport authorities are also recommended to design more applicable training courses to encourage drivers

Abstract 
Customers in today’s evolving markets are seeking options that best suit their specific needs; consequently, the 
demand for highly-customized and personalized products has been growing steadily. In order to facilitate customized 
manufacturing, the structure of the underlying supply chain (SC) needs to be enhanced in terms of flexibility and 
resilience. In this study, we consider an SC comprising a main manufacturer that produces custom-designed modular-
structured products, featured with different design complexity levels. The products have a bill-of-material (BOM) that 
can be altered in terms of the design of a subset of sub-assemblies and components. It is further assumed that the 
company collaborates with a group of manufacturers and part suppliers (upstream SC entities), differentiated in terms 
of capacity, technological capabilities, and cost, along with a group of logistics carriers (downstream entities) 
distinguished in the sense of their cost and lead time. In other words, in addition to involving customers in the product 
design, the company also provides different modes of product delivery (e.g., fast, regular, and slow) offered by 
different logistics carriers. We also incorporate the uncertainty involved in the manufacturing of subassemblies and 
parts featured with complex designs. More specifically, to reflect the amount of effort required to manufacture 
complex designs, the production and procurement costs of (highly or moderately complex) items are considered as 
piece-wise linear functions of their order quantity. Furthermore, the manufacturing capability of upstream entities for 
producing complex items are assumed uncertain, and modeled as scenarios. More precisely, under some scenarios, 
the producers/suppliers will not be capable of fulfilling the order of highly/moderately complex items within the 
promised production lead time due to technological limitations. 
To obtain the optimal configuration of the above-mentioned SC, we first develop a deterministic mixed-integer 
programming (MIP) model that seeks the optimal choice of sub-assembly producers, part suppliers, and logistics 
carriers in addition to the optimal quantity of procurement, production, and transportation at different echelons. The 
objective is to minimize the total manufacturing, transportation, and lost-sale cost. Afterward, in order to incorporate 
the uncertain technological capabilities of producers/suppliers, the above MIP model is reformulated as a two-stage 
stochastic program (2-SP). In this model, three types of corrective (recourse) actions are considered in order to 
compensate for the incapability of producers/suppliers in the manufacturing of complex products. These actions 
correspond to resorting to backup suppliers/producers; purchasing sub-assemblies and components from the open 
market; and lost-sale, in case none of the first two actions are feasible. Obviously, the cost of all recourse actions 
mentioned above is substantially higher than the cost of the initial assignment of producers/suppliers that must be set 
prior to receive full insight in terms of suppliers’ capabilities. We explore a sample average approximation (SAA) 
scheme to solve the 2-stage stochastic MIP model under different scenario sets. In-depth computational experiments 
are conducted to validate the proposed models and solution algorithm while showcasing the value of incorporating 
uncertainty into the SC design problem.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to examine the role of supply management for sales and operations planning (S&OP) during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. A deductive approach was deployed by building on a qualitative pre-study and various 
strands of SCM literature. All in all, eight hypotheses were derived and subsequently tested by drawing on an empirical 
sample collected from 130 global manufacturing ﬁrms operating in China. The data was then analyzed using partial 
least squares (PLS) analysis. The results indicated that business performance was positively influenced by the extent 
of S&OP activities, which in turn proved to be positively influenced by organizational setup, information sharing and 
supply management practices. The level of supply chain leadership turned out to act as antecedent to all of the three 
latter aforementioned.

1. Introduction
At the end of 2019, an unknown virus first hit in Wuhan, Hubei, one of the China’s biggest cities where many factories 
are located, with a complete city-wide lockdown lasting for ten weeks as a result (Yang et al. 2020). It subsequently 
spread to virtually every other country around the world in the ensuing months (Li et al. 2020). On Mar 11th 2020, it 
was proclaimed a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020). With US$9.7 
trillion in intermediate goods trade, constituting 52% of global trade in goods exports (WorldBank  2019)，made the 
global economic and trade environment even tougher and brought further implications to world trade (Haake 2020; 
Heiland & Ulltveit-Moe  2020; van Hoek 2021).  
Many countries responded to the pandemic by closing or at least restricted their borders, cancelling flights, stopped 
inter-country rail transport, restricted domestic traffic and increased immigration controls (Abu-Rayash & Dincer, 
2020). As a result of the pandemic restrictions, international highways became congested by passenger and 
transportation vehicles. Large ports around the world also began to impose pandemic countermeasures, for instance 
quarantine routines for workers from major outbreak countries, prohibiting ships from entering and docking, in some 
cases shutting down seaports completely (Saleheen & Habib 2022). Due to the restriction between countries, global 
supply chains became severely constricted (Guan et al. 2020; Heiland & Ulltveit-Moe  2020).  
The pandemic has severely impacted supply chains across most industries, with shortages and soaring raw material 
prices as a result (Alsharef, Banerjee, Uddin, Albert, & Jaselskis 2021; Cai & Luo 2020; Gałaś et al., 2021). The 
situation has been particularly severe in e.g. the automotive industry where semiconductor shortages have caused 
production line stoppages for most global automotive OEMs (Ionela-Roxana, Boscoianu, Vrajitoru, & Boscoianu; 
Nickel & Schliebener 2021; Sawik  2020). 
Considering the aforementioned, this begs the question what companies should do in order to mitigate the negative 
impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on their supply chains, in particular related to supply shortages. The objective 
of this paper is to examine and test existing theory on sales and operations planning (S&OP) within the particular

Abstract 
Nowadays, new technology tends to consume more and more power than before thus housing, and enclosures are 
designed to cool thermal energy dissipated by servers which are enclosed with louder fans for the new generation of 
5G servers or BTS system. This paper is a collaboration with Viettel R&D and attempts to construct a shroud for 
reducing acoustic noise of the 5G server unit using fan for cooling system, and the 5G RRU thermal simulation has 
been implemented. In this study, air ducts are created with different wall impedances to damp an acoustic model of 
the propagating wave. In order to predict the result, a finite element analysis has been proposed to compute the sound 
level. Obtained results will be compared with ones of the constructed shroud in Laboratory. The results can be applied 
for many BTS systems of Viettel to reducing noise for future development. Thermal simulation of 5G RRU has been 
built with different power levels and experimental result of temperature distribution have been implemented. A new 
contribution of this study is a comprehensive modeling method for acoustic noise level and thermal management of 
BTS and RRU 5G. 
Keywords:

1. Introduction
The idea of this paper is to create a housing shroud to reduce acoustic noise of 5G Baseband Telecom Station server. 
The housing shroud has been designed with different materials (Cremer or rubber) to build silencer for reducing the 
noise. This silencer is placed in between exhaust air whilst and   the server fan which is cooling system of 5G server. 
This project is solve comprehensive problem both the acoustic and the thermal simulation of 5G BTS telecom base 
station included server sectors and RRU 5G. 
Acoustic noise of the sound pressure is generally noise caused by the blade pass frequency of the fans both the intake 
and the exhaust. In order to reduce acoustic noise, a silencer was designed as damper which is a form of Cremer damping 
in ducts in Sack 2016. The modal sound attenuation in ducts has been developed for several decals by J. Tester 1973. 
However, recently, FEM analytical and simulation methods are useful to investigate acoustic noise performances.   
2. Analytical Calculation
The construction of silencer of 5G BTS is produced by damping materials and forming in ducts or holes, because thea 
are very convenient to put them in conventional system. The silencer wall is desinged by a theory method to make the 
next order duct mode merge with the propagating plane wave, resulting in optimal attenuation of the merged mode pair. 
The wall impedances are two modes in the complex wavenumber plane. In addition,  there is an attenuation peak for 
these modes traveling in the duct. For such a rectangular duct with negligible flow speeds, a branch point equation can 
be expressed as: 
𝐻𝐻= ൫𝛽𝛽1

where  β1 and β2 are the normalized admittances for two opposing liner walls with a duct width of h

  The sound values are 98.1 dB without and 76.3 with silencer boxes. To validate the resulting simulator, the shroud 
values of the server with silencer in fig 8 good agreement with fig 9.b. The sound level between before and after 
applied the shroud or silencer is about 22dB. The fan has been operated with full load power of BBU and 5G RRU. 
In practice, the separating board was constructed. To avoid vibrations from the other devices, the sound instrument 
was placed about 1m from the server. The difference of sound power level between the intake and the exhaust is for 
relevant frequencies about 23 dB being higher than the exhaust. The conclusion is shown that both the intake and the 
exhaust need noise reduction. 
 
4. Conclusion  
This paper has been successfully developed by the FEM. The obtained results have also been checked to be close the 
experiment methods for Telecom server coupling to RRU 5G with different power and losses.  The resulting shroud 
has quite noticeably reduced the emitted sound from the server. The average sound power level is about 23 dB, which 
fulfills the scope of this project of at least 20dB sound power level reduction. This paper has also illustrated that the 
temperature of 5G RRU and sound level of Telecom 5G will increase with the load power. Thermal and acoustic noise 
simulations have been carried out and compared with sound measure devices and thermal image results in the 
laboratory by supporting Viettel High Technology Industries Corporation, Vietnam.

Abstract 
This article presents a new remote fault diagnosis and alarm architecture with the use of Cyber-physical systems and 
Cloud technology. Due to the large quantity of data collected from machines and their processing Cloud computing 
and Cyber-physical systems play a key role in such maintenance purposes. Currently, several remote diagnosis 
troubleshooters with different diagnostic tools and connection techniques have been proposed, but they rarely find 
interpretable diagnosis techniques. As such, the purpose of this paper is to propose a cyber-remote fault diagnosis 
system based on the combination between pattern recognition techniques and Cloud Technologies. The new 
troubleshooter is based on Cloud Computing to connect the system components achieving the cyber-physical system 
definition for Industry 4.0. Our system is a remote online device that measures vibration signals. The proposed 
troubleshooter is tested using the run-to-failure of aerospace rolling element-bearing data sets. The results reveal that 
the proposed methodology improves diagnostic accuracy compared with the most popular methodology used in 
other related systems. Finally, current and future Cyber-physical systems and Cloud technologies applications in the 
maintenance field are discussed.

1. Introduction
Due to the new generation of telecommunication, the industry progressed to a new age (Kagermann et al. 2016). 
Maintenance of technical facilities and systems in operational condition is one of the most crucial factors in assuring 
their high availability and reliability [Werbińska 2023]. Because poorly maintained equipment can result in more 
frequent failures of facilities and their components, poor operational efficiency, or delays in achieving operational 
schedules, maintenance has increasingly attracted the attention of engineers and management. Poorly chosen or 
planned maintenance strategies for any equipment can lead to, among other things, receiving items of dubious 
quality, lowering energy efficiency in some sectors, or under/over-utilizing maintenance staff (Kumar 2000, Crespo 
et al. 2018). As a result, an increasing number of businesses are making efforts to boost the effectiveness of the 
maintenance process for their physical assets [Kagermann et al. 2016 to Crespo et al. 2018]. New technologies such 
as Cloud computing makes communication between the maintenance process. Also using the data mining techniques 
gives the ability of generates interpretable patterns which illustrate the hidden phenomena of the machine condition. 
 In the following section, the objectives of the research are illustrated to focus on the unique Remote  Diagnosis 
System (RDS). The new RDS uses the cloud to communicate between the maintenance layers and data mining

5.1 Proposed Improvements 
We proposed a new technique that is not used before in remote maintenance systems. We found that the most 
popular machine learning techniques according to the literature survey are ANN and SVM. So we compare the 
proposed supervised machine learning technique and the most popular techniques. The comparison factors are the 
accuracy and interpretability of each technique. Table (3), the accuracy between the proposed and most popular 
techniques is compared. The proposed technique has the highest accuracy which improves the maintenance 
efficiency. On the hand, LAD beats the other technique in the second-factor interpretability. The comparison result 
drives the usage of LAD as a preferable technique in building the diagnosis mode. The diagnosis model is based on 
using the Cloud to communicate between the monitored machine and the diagnosis model to overcome the distance 
effect and improve the ability of real-time monitoring to achieve near-zero breakdown. Using the Cloud is matched 
with the requirement of the third level of Cyber-Physical Systems. The test is done by the National Science 
Foundation’s Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) through 
the NASA Prognostic data repository. The difference in this case is that the new data set is being unlabeled; 
meaning that there is no class separation between the two classes. The method is proposed to convert the unlabeled 
data to a labeled one. The proposed method is using the feature plot to find the cut point between the different 
classes.  The proposed method and the results are illustrated in Figures (4, 5, and 6). The architecture of the labeled 
remote diagnosis system is proposed in Figure (2). It solves two problems; the first one is the remote location and 
the second one is connecting all maintenance process partners such as the local maintenance team in the physical 
field near the monitored machines. Also connecting to the spare part suppliers to prepare the required spare part 
needs to make the maintenance process.  
 
5.2 Validation  
The following step is to validate the data to use supervised LAD to find the hidden patterns by comparing the 
proposed technique and the popular machine learning techniques Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM). In the following table, we compare the accuracy of ANN, SVM, and LAD for each method 
of labeling. Table (3) illustrates the accuracy of each Machine Learning technique. 
 
Table 3. Average Model Accuracy of each Technique:- 
 
Technique 
                   ANN                       
SVM                                         
LAD 
   Accuracy 
                 95.001%                       92.9664%                                        96.0396% 
  
Table (3) illustrates that LAD has higher accuracy compared to the other techniques. So we use LAD to build the 
model of remote diagnosis for labeled data.  
 
6. Conclusion  
In this paper, a new remote maintenance labeled system based on LAD is developed. The proposed model is tested 
by using a run-to-failure data set of aerospace bearings collected from the NASA Prognostic data repository with 
different faults. The LAD diagnosis tool is compared with the most popular techniques ANN and SVM. The 
proposed technique, LAD, makes both diagnosis and decision by the involvement of the Cloud technologies to 
match the cyber-physical-system requirements to achieve the buzzword nowadays Industry 4.0. The advantages of 
the proposed system are reduced maintenance process cost by the continuous monitoring of the operating behavior 
of the mechanical part to achieve near zero breaks down. The reliability of the monitored machines is enhanced 
which improves the industry process cost. Also by using the proposed machine learning technique avoid an 
expensive onsite need for expert engineers visit to the machines local site of the monitored machines. The system is 
based on Cloud Computing technology to connect the proposed RDS layers. The proposed layers are a sensor layer, 
connection layer, collect analysis and decision-making layer. The analysis of collected vibration signals is 
constructed based on an interpretable methodology dealing with labeled data. The proposed analysis techniques are 
divided into three steps. The proposed steps are data collection by using smart sensors, statistical feature extractions, 
and graphical methods to divide the extracted data into classes.  In summary, the proposed RDS helps to achieve the 
continuous monitoring and decision-making of the maintenance process via distance based on Cloud technology 
possibilities. The implemented system connects the maintenance process chain to achieve the near zero breaks 
down.

In future work, the performance of the remote diagnosis system will be enhanced by improving the proposed 
technique. A multi-component diagnosis using the same diagnosis center will be the future step. Furthermore, 
enhancing the communication between the system components to increase the reliability of the maintenance task 
will be considered. This step will be used in the real-time learning remote maintenance system.

Abstract 
Coir twine rope is a natural and eco-friendly alternative to synthetic ropes, which are utilized in various industries 
such as marine, agriculture, and construction. The coir rope twining industry in Quezon Province has been around for 
many years and has provided employment opportunities to its community. It is usually done through manual material 
handling, which is one of the leading causes of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in industrially developing 
countries like the Philippines. In this study, ten (10) workers of ABC Company, specifically their plant site located in 
Barangay Kanlurang Maligaya, Agdangan, Quezon, were assessed through observation using the Rapid Entire Body 
Assessment and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment to identify the level of risk associated with the twining process. They 
were also interviewed using the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaires to assess their physical 
discomfort. Results from REBA and RULA show very high-risk levels based on the different postures associated with 
the tasks, while the CMDQ results revealed that seven (7) out of ten (10) workers experience moderate discomfort, 
while the remaining three (3) experience severe discomfort primarily in the upper back (8.21%) and lower back 
(8.31%), as well as in the right and lower leg (6.55%). Spearman-Rho correlation analysis showed a significant 
relationship between the total RULA score and the physical discomfort of the lower arm at the 0.05 significance level. 
Thus, the researchers use the anthropometric measurements of five (5) workers to design an ergonomic twining 
machine that will reduce the risk levels and prevent workers from developing MSD.

Abstract 
Machine Learning (ML) is one of the recent set of tools and techniques under artificial intelligence, interacting with 
robotics, data mining and data science domains. This study provides a comprehensive review regarding the significant 
potential of ML in logistics and Supply Chain Management (SCM). First, main techniques and approaches categorized 
under ML are investigated. Afterwards, various supply chain operations and processes are associated with the most 
relevant and frequently used ML tools and techniques. Main supply chain processes having the potential for benefitting 
from ML are identified. It is supported that ML has notable opportunities to bring improvements in forecasting 
accuracy, increase operational efficiency and productivity; decrease inventory costs; and improve reliability, 
availability, and performance of machines and equipment. Findings revealed that aforementioned ML techniques are 
useful in almost all macro SCM processes including supplier management, demand management, customer 
management, inventory management, maintenance management, transportation management, distribution 
management, quality management, import/export management and shop floor management. Through the 
implementation of various ML algorithms, smart and autonomous decision-making and predictive capabilities are 
built for more intelligent processes.  These techniques are utilized in different hybrids with a variety of IoT 
technologies (such as sensors, GPS, vehicle tracking systems, 3D printers, robots/COBOTS) to bring improvements. 
Based on sensor data coming from different points of the IoT ecosystem, ML algorithms enable advanced analysis 
and prediction of patterns, such as failure patterns of machines in the shop floor, customer demand patterns, inventory 
consumption patterns and quality defect patterns.  Consequently, ML tools and techniques represent a great potential 
to provide more data-driven and predictive management of SC processes, and to contribute to end-to-end supply chain 
traceability, visibility and transparency.

Abstract 
Developing process efficiencies resulting in shorter cycle times (i.e., the elapsed time between starting and completing 
a job) is one mechanism organizations often use to achieve a competitive advantage, higher profits, and/or better 
customer satisfaction. Given the nature of their business, minimizing process cycle time is a necessity for third-party 
logistics providers (3PLs). This research examined how one Portuguese 3PL reduced its process cycle time through 
an action research project in which researchers worked side-by-side with employees to develop and implement 
practical solutions. Given the specific goal to reduce the cycle time of their existing inbound logistics process across 
four warehouses, the company selected the Lean Six Sigma methodology to guide its process improvement efforts. 
This began with mapping the process, analyzing measurement systems, and collecting cycle time data. In addition to 
establishing a baseline measurement, these data were analyzed to identify the sub-process steps, clients, product types, 
etc. with the longest cycle times. These aspects were then analyzed further to determine the causes of waste in the 
process. Next, ideas were developed regarding how to reduce/eliminate the causes of waste, these ideas were evaluated 
using group decision-making tools, and the most appropriate solutions were implemented. Because employees’ input 
was incorporate through every step of this project, few issues were encountered when implementing process changes. 
Finally, a control plan was established to facilitate behavior change of employees working in the processes and monitor 
the improved process performance to ensure long-term sustainment of the reduced cycle times.

Abstract 
Big data has become a thrilling milestone for gaining new opportunities and improving performance. Recent research 
indicated that big data analytics—the fourth paradigm of science—has the potential to develop business practices and 
sustainable operations; yet, concerning its contribution to developing sustainable products, there is a notable lack of 
knowledge and uncertainty. Thus, this study aims to investigate the contribution of big data analytics to developing 
sustainable products; the products that benefit the triple bottom line, i.e., economy, environment, and society. As such, 
the method of the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is employed. The findings 
revealed that big data analytics could make a considerable contribution to developing the efficiency of product end-
of-life management, among other product sustainability criteria identified. Such an appraisal, which is of critical 
importance to sustainable development, can be beneficial to decision makers and those who are keen to gain a better 
knowledge of big data analytics and its contribution to developing sustainable products.

1. Introduction
Big data has been viewed as a large volume of scientific data for visualization (Cox and Ellsworth 1997). According 
to Laney (2001), it is characterized by the 3Vs, i.e., Volume, Variety, and Velocity; however, there may be other 
characteristics needing to be considered (Ren et al. 2019), e.g., Value (Gantz et al. 2011), and/or Veracity referring to 
the unreliability and uncertainty inherent in some sources of data (Zikopoulos et al. 2012). Big Data Analytics (BDA) 
is hence regarded as the “next big thing” in managerial and developmental initiatives and/or in nurturing business 
opportunities (Kwon et al. 2014; Ali et al. 2020). It refers to vast and intricate data sets and analytical methods in 
applications that need the deployment of complex and unique technology for archiving, managing, analyzing, and 
visualizing. BDA's significant impact will be witnessed within the manufacturing context, specifically in R&D, 
production, customer service, maintenance/repair, and overhaul technical support, as well as recycling and 
remanufacturing. By providing insight into manufacturers, it enables them to understand their current and projected 
situations, and at the same time identify the requirements for achieving more optimal outcomes. It has the potential to 
drive the adoption of cleaner production methods and facilitate the progress of sustainable production and consumption 
practices (Zhang et al. 2017). Consequently, practitioners can enhance the value of various products through the 
utilization of this concept (Wang et al. 2021; Gholami et al. 2022). 
Recent research indicated that BDA has also the potential to develop sustainable products. In this regard, Ali et al. 
(2020) indicated the positive impact of big data analytics on sustainable product development is evident, and this 
development, in turn, significantly influences organizational performance. BDA is shifting the process of sustainable 
products development (Johnson et al. 2017). In pursuit of sustainability, organizations are harnessing the power of big

5. Conclusion 
Big data analytics is experiencing rapid global growth as organizations pursue maximum value and sustainable 
competitive advantage. However, when it comes to its role in developing sustainable products, there is a lack of 
knowledge and certainty, which calls for innovative research. As such, this study is aimed at investigating the potential 
contribution of BDA to the development of sustainable products. To this end, a Fuzzy TOPSIS approach is employed 
to analyze the subject based on a set of respective criteria. The analyses and findings demonstrated that the criterion 
‘product end-of-life management efficiency’ has the highest closeness coefficient of 0.79, revealing that BDA could 
make a considerable contribution to developing product end-of-life management efficiency, among other product 
sustainability criteria identified. The findings would significantly contribute to the body of BDA knowledge as this 
study stands as the primary empirical investigation exploring the contribution of BDA in the development of 
sustainable products on the basis of product sustainability criterion. The significance of this research lies in its ability 
to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and sustainable practices, ultimately paving the way for a more 
sustainable future. The enriched insights provided by this study may open up new possibilities and avenues for further 
exploration and innovation in the field of BDA for sustainable products. Further studies are recommended to 
extensively investigate and delve deeper into the findings, and to also explore a broader range of criteria that have the 
potential to influence the development of sustainable products within the realm of BDA. The vastness and complexity 
of this research domain call for continuous exploration and scholarly inquiry to unlock new insights and push the 
boundaries of knowledge in this field. It is imperative to expand our understanding and uncover hidden dimensions to 
fully grasp the transformative potential of BDA in fostering sustainable products development, which is of vital 
importance to sustainable development.

Abstract 
Floating offshore wind farms (FOWFs) are considered one of the fastest-growing types of renewable 
energy technologies and are superior to bottom-fixed offshore wind farms due to their low requirement 
of seabed conditions. The cost of dynamic submarine cables constitutes a significant proportion of the 
overall capital cost for FOWFs, making optimization of the cable connection layout a critical aspect of 
modern wind farm design. To this end, we propose a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) 
model that takes into account the impact of the wake effect in various wind scenarios. Our proposed 
objective is to minimize both the cost of cable investment and power losses. 
In contrast to traditional FOWFs that require expensive offshore substations and high-voltage 
transmission cables, the FOWFs presented in this paper are designed to directly supply energy to 
independent power systems located on nearby offshore oil and gas platforms (OOGPs). We employ the 
Benders decomposition algorithm to solve our proposed MIQP model, with two valid inequalities 
introduced to accelerate convergence speed during the decomposition process. These valid inequalities 
are formulated based on technical/physical analysis and a greedy-based heuristic initialization. We 
demonstrate the validity and fast convergence speed of our approach through several FOWF case studies.

Abstract 
This study investigates the various challenges allied with using built asset data in promoting long-term sustainability 
in flood-prone communities. A qualitative research approach was followed with semi-structured interviews to identify 
the challenges in terms of data acquisition, management, classification and utilization. The significant challenges 
include the scarcity of data, data quality, data silos, legal restrictions on data sharing, lack of standardized data 
collection methods, and more.  These challenges cause significant hurdles to the effective and efficient utilization of 
built asset data for flood resilience planning. Overcoming these challenges needs collaboration between various 
stakeholders and creating innovative solutions to overcome the intricacies of data management and data processing. 
By emphasizing the need of overcoming these challenges, this paper highlights the significant role of built asset data 
in enhancing the resilience of flood-prone communities and promoting long-term sustainability.

1. Introduction
Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, causing tremendous economic, social, and environmental 
damage to communities around the world. As yet, many countries are prone to flooding due to rapid developments of 
unplanned settlement, unrestricted building constructions and significant land use changes influencing the spatial-
temporal pattern of hazards (Pradhan 2010). Floods can have disastrous effects on a community's economy, society, 
and ecology, resulting in fatalities, property devastation, and damage to vital infrastructure (Towe 2020). Flood 
resilience, therefore, is crucial to ensuring that communities take proactive steps and measures to improve their 
resilience against flood risks. Flood resilience is important for sustainability because it helps communities to prepare 
for and adapt to the impacts of floods (Bigueras et al.  2018). By promoting and fostering flood resilience, communities 
are able to reduce the vulnerability of their inhabitants and infrastructure to flooding events, while minimizing the 
economic, social, and environmental impacts of flood events. Flood resilience essentially supports the long-term 
sustainability goals of the communities which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of 
natural resources, and promoting social equity (Hao & Wang 2021).   
As climate change continues to exacerbate the risk of flood impacts with massive damages, it is increasingly becoming 
important to create innovative resilience-related solutions to enhance flood resilience and sustainability in 
communities. One such modern approach that recently gained traction in flood resilience is the utilization of enormous 
data to support resilience-related decision-making and long-term sustainability goals in flood-affected areas (Saker et 
al. 2020). In the context of data utilization, built asset data plays a special role in achieving flood resilience and long-
term sustainability. Built asset data includes information about physical structures and assets such as buildings, 
infrastructure facilities, and other structures in a community. By collecting and analyzing these data, communities can 
improve the understanding of their flood risk and create more effective flood risk mitigation measures on built assets 
(Adeniyi et al. 2022). In addition, leveraging built asset data can facilitate sustainable land use planning, and better 
community engagement, and foster many other long-term sustainability efforts that build resilience over time (Saker

5.2 Data Classification Challenges 
Effective classification of data is an important step in leveraging built asset data to flood resilience enhancement and 
promoting sustainable outcomes. Nevertheless, the classification challenges of data need to be addressed. One of the 
main challenges is the lack of available methods or a direction for data pre-processing and processing, which can lead 
to inconsistencies or incomplete data analysis results. Data classification is also challenging due to the long and time-
consuming process. This could delay the analysis and use of the data for flood resilience efforts. Data integration was 
also identified as another significant challenge when data are stored in multiple locations and formats.  This makes 
data classification more complex and a sophisticated task to analyze. In terms of data security, network security threats 
and data complexities pose considerable challenges, due to the sensitivity of built asset data and required security for 
data classification and management. Resource constraints also limit the ability to effectively classify built asset data 
for flood resilience purposes. Data pre-processing, structuring, and standardizing data capture, data cleaning, and 
archiving are important steps in data classification however it is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Also, a range 
of uncertainties is associated with these data, including limitations in the data quality, incomplete datasets, and finally 
uncertainties around modelling assumptions. Finally, the lack of standards for the data classification process can also 
present challenges, as it is difficult to compare and analyze data from different sources when there are no consistent 
definitions or classification schemes. 
 
5.3 Data Management Challenges   
One of the data management challenges is complexity, as it makes the data management process complex in effectively 
managing and analysing large volumes of built asset data. On the other hand, limited stakeholder engagement presents 
challenges, limiting the availability of data and insights necessary for effective flood resilience planning. Distrust of 
the openly available data is also a significant challenge, as it limits data sharing and collaboration between 
stakeholders. Additionally, data that are not clearly tagged or defined for each property is considered as it is difficult 
to analyze and compare data across properties. Data access, ownership, privacy, and security are other important 
considerations in the process of data management, as they can limit the sharing and use of different data. For example, 
data ownership and privacy concerns restrict access to essential datasets, while security concerns limit the sharing of 
various data between different stakeholders.  
 
5.4 Data Utilization Challenges  
Built asset data should be effectively used for flood resilience planning which is crucial for promoting sustainable 
outcomes. Nevertheless, there are several challenges of data utilization that need to be addressed. Another significant 
challenge is the culture of working and tolerating poor-quality data, which can lead to invalid and incorrect insights 
and ineffective flood resilience planning. One other significant challenge is assigning values for each data for 
insurance premiums as it can be difficult to accurately determine the level of risk and potential costs associated with 
flooding. Additionally, there is a lack of mathematically proven equations or studies to represent these relationships, 
which can limit the accuracy of flood risk assessments and insurance premiums. Increasing premiums with increasing 
volumes of data is also a challenge, as it can create disincentives for the sharing and utilization of data. Adopting the 
most appropriate data techniques is also important, as different data techniques may be more effective for different 
types of data and applications. Gaps exist between human and technological capacity that creates challenges in 
handling information. Data interpretation, complexity, and lack of standardization can also create challenges in 
utilizing built asset data for flood resilience planning. These findings highlight the need for concerted efforts to address 
these data challenges to enhance built asset flood resilience and sustainable goals. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the challenges related to built asset data acquisition, management, and utilization for flood resilience 
planning and sustainable outcomes are significant. These challenges include data scarcity, lack of data standardization, 
data security, complexity, and resource constraints. Addressing these challenges will require a collaborative effort 
between various stakeholders, including government agencies, builders, insurers, and technology providers, among 
others. Innovative solutions and approaches, such as the use of digital twins and machine learning algorithms, can 
help overcome some of these challenges and enable effective utilization of built asset data for flood resilience 
planning. By addressing these challenges and leveraging the power of built asset data, decision-makers can promote 
long-term sustainability in flood-prone communities and enhance their resilience to future flood events.

Abstract 
This improvement project was conducted in a warehouse that provides repair services and storage for the equipment, 
supplies/consumables, and repair parts needed to perform technical cleaning and hygiene services for clients such as 
in schools, hospitals, airports, etc. While initially organizing materials one section/area at a time using 5S (sort, set-
in-order, shine, standardize, and sustain), challenges encountered included space limitations with the existing layout, 
co-location of repair and storage operations, inability to temporarily shut-down operations to organize, and resistance 
to disposing of unneeded items. To resolve the space/layout issues, management invested in renovating the warehouse. 
While cleaning prior to renovations, many sorting activities took place. Post-renovations, to organize and streamline 
operations (set-in-order and shine), a new space utilization plan was developed and implemented that organized items 
across the warehouse into separate storage zones, designated space only for performing repairs, and stored all repair 
parts together in the same zone. To standardize, visual controls were implemented, including floor markings and 
storage location labels, as well as a shadow peg board and a toolbox with foam cut-outs in the repair work area. In 
addition, standard operating procedures were developed. To sustain, a bi-weekly audit procedure was developed, and 
a communication board was installed where, among other things, audit feedback would be posted. Finally, inventory 
reorder points were established, and a Kanban system was implemented for material replenishment.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 technologies, such as additive manufacturing (AM) and blockchain technology, may drive the 
implementation of a new generation of circular economy strategies. However, the role of these new 
technologies in designing and implementing circular economy ecosystems is not a trivial issue. In this 
sense, this PhD research work intended to foster knowledge for the development of industrial symbiosis 
networks within the AM industry - the so-called additive symbiotic networks. A systematic literature review 
was performed and revealed current circular economy relationships within the AM industry and highlighted 
the potential of this industry to create and develop additive symbiotic networks, in plastic wastes from other 
industries may be used as material inputs for AM processes. A definition of the concept additive symbiotic 
networks is proposed in this work.  
Nevertheless, given the digital nature of AM and considering challenges related to trust or the 
implementation of transactions within the additive symbiotic networks, there is a need to find tools that 
enable the development of those networks. Blockchain technology may be an enabler of such symbiotic 
networks, and its adoption within these settings may have implications in the supply chain of additive 
symbiotic networks. Using an abductive research approach, in this work two case studies were conducted 
concerning two additive symbiotic networks, that comprised companies using AM processes to valorize 
plastic waste streams. Case study A highlighted that there is potential within the context of additive 
symbiotic networks to explore the adoption of blockchain technology and identified a set of requirements 
that support the technology adoption in that specific network context. From these conclusions, case study 
B was developed to understand the implications of adopting such disruptive technology as the blockchain 
in the supply chain structure of an additive symbiotic network. Results showed that with the adoption of 
blockchain there is a reduction in the number of intermediary stakeholders involved in the network and 
there is an adaptation of the value flows within the network.  
By offering a tool that helps to deal with the challenges associated with the additive symbiotic networks, 
exploring its adoption and some of its implications in the supply chain of those networks, this PhD work 
encourages the development of the additive symbiotic networks, contributing to the efficient use of natural 
resources, promoting the collaboration between industries, and reducing waste streams to achieve more 
sustainable production.

Abstract 
Project-based organizations (PBOs) are loosely coupled, with significant decentralization of power that makes 
complex the alignment of projects, governance system and functional units. Moreover, projects are constantly 
changing in a PBO. Therefore, a solution for PBO design and analysis is needed to provide cohesion of a single design 
in constant remapping. Designing a PBO involves aligning strategy, structure, processes, organizational behaviour 
and people, as well as the project management (PM) practices and artefacts. However, the available tools to achieve 
this goal do not have an integrated overview between the organization and PM. Also, they are mainly in the form of a 
text guideline that makes its application difficult. In order to fill this gap, this research seeks to develop an integration 
between project management and enterprise architecture domains. The above is performed through a conceptual 
integration of the ArchiMate language for modelling the organizational architecture and the PMBOK PMs' body of 
knowledge, providing an alternative tool for covering the PBO design, analysis and modelling concerns. This 
integrated model has been developed through the semantic web that enhances computer querying and reasoning for 
its analysis. An evaluation has been performed through automatic ontology debugger tools.

Abstract 
Digital transformation is a concept that is currently being discussed and emphasized in many policies, industrial and 
corporate strategies. In the scientific literature, digital transformation is often discussed as one of the pillars of a 
sustainable economy.  On the other hand, the question is how to ensure that the digital transformation process itself is 
sustainable in the long term. That is, not only the transformation process itself but also the application of digital 
technologies in companies afterwards. This paper aims to explore the sustainability of digital transformation by 
analyzing its environmental, economic, and social impact. Through a literature review, this paper identifies several 
key factors that contribute to the sustainability of digital transformation, including the term energy transformation and 
education and digital skills, security, and business continuity. Based on the conducted research a model of sustainable 
digital transformation was proposed. The model presents the key elements for the sustainability of digital 
transformation. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for organizations, and 
individuals.

1. Introduction
Digital transformation has become a central focus in policies, industrial strategies, and corporate agendas, reflecting 
the widespread recognition of its potential to shape the future of economies and organizations. This concept refers to 
the integration of digital technologies into various aspects of businesses and societies, fundamentally altering the way 
they operate, interact, and create value. The rapid advancement of technology, coupled with increasing connectivity 
and data availability, has propelled the prominence of digital transformation as a key driver of innovation, productivity, 
and competitiveness. 
The motivation behind the emphasis on digital transformation lies in its ability to unlock new opportunities, address 
emerging challenges, and foster sustainable growth. In today's dynamic and interconnected world, organizations and 
economies are facing unprecedented disruption and rapid shifts in consumer expectations, industry landscapes, and 
global markets. Digital transformation presents a strategic pathway to navigate these complexities, enabling businesses 
to remain relevant, agile, and resilient in an ever-evolving digital era. 
Furthermore, digital transformation is often discussed as one of the pillars of a sustainable economy. By leveraging 
digital technologies, organizations can optimize resource utilization, streamline processes, reduce environmental 
impact, and contribute to the transition to a more sustainable future. This aligns with the growing recognition of the 
need to reconcile economic growth with environmental responsibility and social inclusivity. 
1.1 Objectives 
However, it is not enough to solely focus on the potential benefits of digital transformation. The question arises of 
how to ensure that the digital transformation process itself is sustainable in the long term. Sustainable digital 
transformation encompasses not only the initial process of technological integration but also the ongoing application 
of digital technologies in companies, ensuring that the outcomes are environmentally responsible, economically 
viable, and socially inclusive.

6. Conclusion  
In this paper, research was conducted to explore the sustainability of digital transformation. As a result, a model for 
sustainable digital transformation has been proposed, encompassing key elements essential for achieving long-term 
sustainability in this process. The model identifies four fundamental pillars and emphasizes the importance of a 
common background. The identified pillars serve as the foundation for creating a sustainable system, not only during 
the digital transformation process but also for the resultant system itself. However, it is worth noting that additional 
pillars can be included in the model to further enhance sustainability. Examples of such pillars may include economic 
health, social and societal factors, technological maturity, and more. 
 
By adopting the proposed model, organizations can ensure that their digital transformation initiatives are not only 
successful in the short term but also contribute to long-term sustainability. The model provides a holistic approach, 
addressing various dimensions of sustainability and encouraging organizations to consider the broader impact of their 
digital transformation efforts. Organizations must recognize that sustainable digital transformation is not solely about 
technological advancements but also encompasses economic, social, and environmental aspects. By considering these 
dimensions and integrating them into their strategies and practices, organizations can create a sustainable digital 
ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders. 
 
In conclusion, the proposed model of sustainable digital transformation offers valuable insights and guidance for 
organizations embarking on digital transformation journeys. By embracing the identified pillars and considering 
additional relevant factors, organizations can navigate the complexities of digital transformation while ensuring long-
term sustainability and maximizing the benefits derived from their efforts.

Abstract 
In order to ensure a successful cement manufacturing process and avoid negative consequences, it is crucial to identify 
and analyze potential risks. The aim of this research paper is to use two models, the Fault Tree analysis and Bayesian 
Networks, to identify and mitigate risks associated with the process. While both models are useful, the Bayesian 
Network model is the dominant one used in the research, and it has been combined with the Fault Tree model to 
address its limitations. Together, the two models work to produce the best possible outcome in terms of risk 
identification and mitigation. The paper intends to offer a solution to evaluate risk profiles in the cement industry 
using Bayesian models. The goal is to improve the methodologies of identifying risk events and categories by 
examining them under uncertainty. The results obtained from this research will help managers make better decisions 
by considering the significance of confidence intervals within the uncertainty region. This approach will ensure that 
the process is well-planned and that risks are identified and mitigated to avoid negative consequences, such as worker 
injuries and harm to third-party personnel.

1. Introduction
The process of cement production is a critical, as cement is a versatile commodity with a wide range of applications, 
which makes it an essential material in many industries. Due to its high demand globally, many manufacturers have 
entered the market to meet the growing demand for cement. As a result, numerous employees are involved in the 
cement production process. For any cement manufacturer, successfully completing each stage of the production 
process with minimal risk is a significant achievement. To achieve this, companies have developed models aimed at 
minimizing operating costs while ensuring the production of high-quality cement. These models focus on risk 
management, which is a crucial aspect of the production process (Radosavljević, S., & Radosavljević, M, 2009). 
The development of infrastructure is a crucial component in a country's progress, and cement is one of the critical 
elements in the construction sector. Cement production is a complex process that involves various components, 
including clay silica, gypsum, and limestone. Each component plays a vital role in the production process, and any 
risk associated with any of these components should be appropriately managed to avoid hindering productivity and 
revenue. One of the significant risks associated with cement production is pollution, particularly dust. The process of 
producing cement results in massive amounts of dust, which poses a severe health risk to both workers and the 
environment (Abuhasel  2019). Dust particles are harmful to human health and can lead to respiratory problems.

Figure 6 . Production Impact with uncertainty. 
BN are used in developing the production risks’ profile in order to determine how the revenue structure of their 
company is exposed. The profiles are, after that, used to rank the risks and know the methods to approach them. The 
revenue estimate is set, and the organization focuses on the most significant risks according to their ranking.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The cement manufacturing process involves multiple stages, each associated with specific risks that can collectively 
reduce a company's revenue. The present paper proposes a methodology using Bayesian networks (BN) to efficiently 
identify and mitigate these risks. The methodology is important and applicable to project managers in charge of 
production risk management. Organizations can use this methodology to approach risks and determine the best way 
to mitigate them while considering production status under uncertainty. One limitation of the paper is the ambiguity 
of the collected data, making it challenging to determine whether the company was being truthful or overrating risks. 
BNs are useful tools in monitoring risks in the industrial sector. Companies should regularly identify risks and create 
a BN risk profile to aid the risk management department in creating new strategies to curb risks and minimize their 
effects. The BN profile can then be updated as new information becomes available, making it a dynamic platform for 
risk management. The risks examined in this paper provide a general solution for the cement manufacturing process 
that can be applied at the industry level, rather than the company level. However, the success of the model is dependent 
on the honesty and accuracy of the parameters used in risk identification. Risk managers should regularly provide 
updated information to ensure the model remains relevant. The paper primarily focuses on the impact of the production 
process on a company's revenue, but other factors, such as the mode of manufacture, can also affect productivity. 
Thus, in application, all these factors should be factored in as they are mutually exclusive. Overall, this methodology 
can help companies in the cement industry, and other industries, identify and mitigate risks to minimize revenue loss 
and improve production efficiency.

Abstract 
It seems impossible to increase efficiencies in a manufacturing setting without first pinpointing the causes of waste. 
The goals of this research were to use the quality management data collected to determine which aspects were 
significantly correlated with manufacturing waste, and then to use machine learning techniques to create a model that 
could predict manufacturing waste. The case study research was used for this analysis. The data range from 2019 to 
2021 and includes 215924 rows and 13 features. Five predictors and eight terminal nodes were used to create the final 
CART model, which achieved an R2 of 0.389 and an accuracy of 97.31%. Inventory management, customer wait 
times, meetings, and unscheduled breaks all contributed to 80% of the time that was wasted. High levels of inventory 
management problems occurred in months 6-11. The waiting times caused by customers averaged 2.97 hours per 
month between months 7 and 11. Meetings that started at 8:00 lasted, on average, 7.5 hours. The majority of the time 
spent waiting is caused by customer complaints that come in between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m. At 7:00, with 
a 4.3-hour lag, most reports of inventory problems were made. Only quantitative secondary data were used in this 
analysis. Qualitative approaches should be prioritized for future studies. Models for predicting waste in the future 
could benefit from using random forests and TreeNet.

1. Introduction
In the manufacturing environment, it appears impossible to improve efficiencies without first understanding the 
sources of waste (Rasi et al. 2015; Yuphin and Ruanchoengchum 2020). Rehman et al. (2018), maintain that 
companies all over the world are constantly looking for ways to cut waste and reduce non-value-adding activities in 
their manufacturing systems or services. The term waste is commonly used to describe business activities that do not 
provide value to customers or increase productivity (Foster 2013; Mostafa and Dumrak 2015; Gupta et al. 2020). In 
the past, the focus has been on the adoption of Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma as strategies to 
deal with waste and variations in business processes (Pepper and Spedding 2010; Shokri and Li 2020; Sodhi et al. 
2020). Rasi et al. (2015), on the other hand, argue that not all companies that implemented the aforementioned 
strategies benefited from them. To better understand the sources of inefficiencies, researchers are now looking for 
ways to leverage the tools that come with Industry 4.0, such as the study of Yuphin and Ruanchoengchum (2020), 
which integrated machine learning and lean manufacturing tools in Thailand's sprocket manufacturing. The integration 
resulted in a 74 percent increase in manufacturing process efficiency and a 10 percent reduction in turn-around time. 
The global push to eliminate waste and improve business efficiencies has compelled South African manufacturers to 
adopt global best practices (Naicker 2017). As a result, the South African company in charge of manufacturing 
components, distribution, and maintenance of spare parts for rolling stock operators has implemented Lean 
Manufacturing and Total Quality Management to reduce waste. It has also implemented tools such as the Qliksense 
quality management system, which tracks hours spent on non-value-adding activities like defect repairs, waiting, 
transportation and overproduction, quality cost, and other business key performance indicators. Although the company 
implemented Lean Manufacturing and Total Quality Management in 2018, the study (Masemola et al. 2021) revealed 
that the majority of the business processes were not subjected to statistical process control. There was significant 
variation in waste across different manufacturing processes, as well as a misunderstanding of some lean manufacturing 
concepts.

6. Conclusion  
To improve manufacturing efficiency, it is necessary to comprehend the sources of waste. This study first analyzed 
quality management data to establish relationships between data characteristics and manufacturing waste. Secondly, 
it used tools for machine learning to develop a model that can predict manufacturing waste. A case study was used in 
this study. We utilized 215924 rows and 13 columns or features spanning 2019 to 2021. The robustness of the model 
was evaluated using RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared. The optimal model consisted of 30 terminal nodes and an R-
squared value of 0.437. This exploratory research required a simplified tree with adequate R-square. The final CART 
model had five predictors, eight terminal nodes, an R-squared value of 0.389, and an accuracy of 97.31%. There was 
a strong relationship between occupation, day of the week, month and the amount of waste generated. Eighty percent 
of waste was attributable to inventory management, waiting on customer, meetings, and contractual breaks. Months 
6, 10, and 11 exhibited significant inventory management issues. In months 7 through 11, the average waiting on 
customer was 2.97 hours. The average duration of 8:00 a.m. meetings was 7.5 hours. The majority of waiting-on 
customer reports arrived between midnight and 5 a.m. Most inventory issues were reported at 7:00, with a delay of 
4.3 hours. The company should improve inventory management, customer relations, and reduce meetings. Future 
research should employ qualitative methods to better comprehend waste factors, as this study only utilized quantitative 
secondary data. In addition, there is a strong belief that Random Forest and TreeNet can improve waste prediction in 
future research.

Abstract 
This study investigated the trends in quality 4.0 and what they mean for various industries. Scopus was the main 
database used in the systematic literature review. Only papers written in English that directly addressed the study's 
research objectives and were published between 2017 and 2023 were included in the analysis. The number of papers 
on quality 4.0 has increased exponentially over the years. The majority of papers came from the TQM Journal, 
followed by the International Journal of Quality Research and Sustainability Switzerland. In our investigation into 
what quality 4.0 means for industries, we used a sample of 14 papers. We used qualitative data analysis known as 
thematic coding, and through inductive thematic coding, we were able to identify 99 codes that were associated with 
quality 4.0. The study found that quality 4.0 is a broad term encompassing nearly all aspects of quality management, 
including big data, digital quality management, connectivity, cybernetics, managing disruptions, simulation, and more. 
According to the study, quality 4.0 is unlikely to change the traditional quality management strategy; rather, it will 
make things smarter, faster, and more intelligent. The study's findings were consistent with previous research and had 
both reliability and validity.

1. Introduction
Quality management has evolved in line with technological and industrial revolutions over the years (Broday 2022; 
Makhanya et al. 2022). The focus has always been on meeting customer expectations, from quality inspection to total 
quality management (Gejo-García et al. 2022; Makhanya et al. 2022). As a result of the increased complexity of 
machine-to-machine and human-to-machine communication brought on by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, quality 
managers and engineers are facing several new challenges. One of the problems is dealing with the large amounts of 
data created by the network of human and machine interactions, which are more than people can handle. Scholars coined 
the term ""quality 4.0"" to describe the unique challenges and approaches to quality management in the Industry 4.0 era 
(Balouei Jamkhaneh et al. 2022; Broday 2022). However, quality 4.0 is still seen as a muddled term with little 
understanding of what it entails (Psarommatis et al. 2022). Others look at quality 4.0 as a digital version of total quality 
management (Thekkoote 2022). As demonstrated in (Broday 2022), the term quality 4.0 does not have a universal 
definition. Some argue that, unlike other forms of quality development, quality 4.0 is driven by marketing and 
information technology rather than manufacturing and engineering.  
Thekkoote (2022), conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the key variables that contribute to the success 
of implementing quality 4.0 effectively. The author (Ibid.) identified leadership support, accessibility of information, 
connectivity, analytics, training, and scalability as critical success factors for quality 4.0 implementation. In a study by 
Sureshchandar (2022), the critical dimensions of quality 4.0 were determined by combining the results of a literature 
review, expert judgment, and an analytical hierarchy process. The findings of the study identified 12 essential 
components that make up quality 4.0. The factors that were considered were leadership, quality culture, customer 
orientation, an effective quality management system, compliance, professionalism, analytical abilities, data-driven 
decision, innovation, and efficient implementation of quality among others. There is a very good understanding in the

research, in general, qualitative researchers do not calculate the reliability of the study. The authors agreed that the 
reliability of qualitative research is based on the systematic processes used to carry out the study(Queirós, Faria and 
Almeida, no date; Hadi and José Closs, 2016). Other researchers should be able to follow the logic of how the study 
was conducted and why certain discussions were held during the research. Similarly, we used a systematic research 
method to ensure that other researchers could easily follow the logic and replicate the process used to conduct this 
research and come to similar conclusions. The findings of this study were similar to those of previous studies. For 
example, the studies of Broday (2022), Maganga and Taifa (2023) found exponential growth in the publications related 
to quality 4.0 since 2016, which is similar to what we found. We found that most of the papers from the TQM Journal 
reflect the same finding (Broday, 2022). We are confident of the study's validity and reliability as its findings are 
consistent with those of other researchers who conducted similar research. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The purpose of this study was to investigate the trends in quality 4.0, as well as to determine what exactly that term 
means for various industries. For this study, a systematic literature review was performed, and the Scopus database 
served as the primary research tool. The period from 2017 to 2023 is covered by the papers that were included in this 
study, and the predominant language used in those papers was English. We made use of 14 papers in our investigation 
into what it means for industries to have quality 4.0. In the study, qualitative data analysis, known as thematic coding, 
was utilized. Through inductive thematic coding, we were able to identify 99 codes that were connected to quality 4.0. 
According to the published research, quality 4.0 is unlikely to change the conventional strategy for quality 
management; rather, it will make things smarter, quicker and more intelligent. The findings of the study indicate that 
quality 4.0 is a broad term that touches nearly all aspects of quality management. Some of the ideas that are beginning 
to predominate discussion under the quality 4.0 umbrella include big data, electronic quality management, digital 
quality management, connectivity, cybernetics, data management, managing disruptions, simulation, and more. This 
study's findings were consistent with previous research, and we concluded that the study had both reliability and 
validity. In reviewing this study, it is worth noting that the study relied on a literature review, which means that some 
of the findings may need to be tested in future studies through interviews or other forms of empirical research. Because 
this study benefited from work published all over the world, we believe that generalizing the findings of this study 
will not be one of the study's limitations.

Abstract 
The global water supply accounts for 7% of worldwide energy consumption. With the increasing energy tariffs, there 
is a growing need to reduce the energy consumption of water supply systems (WSS). Among the three primary areas 
for optimization in WSS, pump operation is the most critical one, representing 70% of the energy consumed in WSS. 
Despite several mathematical formulations and approaches for optimizing pump operation in WSS, there is a lack of 
comparative studies between them. Moreover, since each WSS system has unique physical characteristics, the 
performance and solutions generated by each formulation may vary. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a 
comparative analysis of three WSS optimization approaches, of which one was never implemented. These approaches 
are applied to two case studies with specific physical characteristics.

1. Introduction
Water supply systems (WSS) are essential infrastructures designed to transport water from distant sources to 
individual consumers in the required quantity and pressure levels (Manteigas et al. 2022). These constitute a crucial 
part of any city worldwide, with the primary objective of delivering treated drinking water to consumers (Manteigas 
et al. 2022).  
The global water supply is responsible for a substantial portion of the world's energy consumption (Manteigas et al. 
2022). As a result, reducing the energy consumption of water supply systems is extremely important to water 
306","Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

It is also important to mention that the B-GA approach's solution is slightly higher because it is a binary approach 
with time-horizons of 30 minutes. This means that when the pump is activated, it must operate at least 30 minutes. As 
a result, the total amount of water pumped is slightly higher compared to the other approaches, which do not have this 
time constraint. Regarding the number of pump starts, the conclusions are the same as in case study 1. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Work 
Optimization applications in water supply systems are several, but it is critical to emphasize the optimization of pump 
operations, as it is an area where energy consumption is significant. With increasing water consumption, energy 
consumption is also increasing. Therefore, optimizing pumping station energy consumption is essential for economic 
and environmental sustainability. Reducing energy consumption in pump operations makes it possible to lower 
operational costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase the overall efficiency of WSS. As such, optimization 
of pump operation is crucial to achieving a sustainable and efficient water supply system. 
 
This study compared three optimization approaches - binary formulation with a genetic algorithm, continuous 
formulation with SLSQP, and duty-cycles formulation with SLSQP. The results indicate that for water supply systems 
where the pump operation point (and, by consequence, the pumped flow) is affected by its physical characteristics, 
i.e. water tank level and consumption points, the duty-cycles formulation with SLSQP (DC-SLSQP) is more effective 
at obtaining economical solutions due to its increased operational freedom. However, it is essential to pay careful 
attention to the initial solution provided to the optimization model as the final solution can be quite sensitive to it.  On

the other hand, in water supply systems where the pumped flow is not dependent on any physical aspect of the system, 
such as in case study 2, the advantage of using the DC-SLSQP approach mentioned above no longer applies. In this 
case, the RC-SLSQP approach may be more advantageous since it can yield similar results to the DC-SLSQP approach 
but with lower processing times.  
 
As for future work, it is necessary to compare the performance of these optimization approaches in more complexes 
case studies (with variable speed pumps) and compare them to approaches with other formulations, not only explicit 
but also implicit ones. Moreover, considering the results of duty-cycles formulation, testing a resolution methodology 
involving several initial solutions is advisable. This will ensure the best operation of the formulation and provide a 
more comprehensive analysis of the problem. By testing multiple initial solutions, it is possible to identify the most 
appropriate solution that provides better results while considering the sensitivity of the duty-cycle formulation.

Abstract 
While Q4.0 does not replace traditional quality methods, it adapts them so that the concept of quality embraces new 
technology to maximize value. The combination of quality management practices with technological tools can become 
a critical factor for organizational success. In the face of this transition, the development of implementation and 
capability roadmaps has gained interest. By providing an assessment of maturity for Q4.0, models show organizations 
their current state of readiness for the digital transition allowing them to see what they lack to meet the desired level 
of maturity through an analysis of each dimension or structural field of the model in depth. As a result, organizations 
can end up with a customized roadmap to help them achieve their strategic goals. This work presents the development 
of the Capability Roadmap towards Quality 4.0. This capability roadmap looks at 3 dimensions – “value chain and 
operations”, “strategy and organization” and “people and culture” – each with 3 sub-dimensions. The capability levels 
are divided into readiness, for levels 1 to 3, and maturity, for levels 4 to 6, where traditional quality tools and 
approaches are integrated with the use of technology.

Abstract 
In recent years, Humanitarian Organizations (HOs) have been coping with increasing humanitarian needs while faced 
with budget cuts. It is thus crucial for the HO to efficiently utilize the limited budget in providing humanitarian aids. 
In this paper, we focus on a HO relief program with a fixed scarce amount of budget to purchase and distribute 
multitype relief items to beneficiaries with heterogeneous demands. Given the budget, the HO first makes item 
purchase from external suppliers and then distributes each type of the items equally to the beneficiaries. Equal 
distribution strategy is a normal practice currently employed in humanitarian operations. However, the strategy fails 
to tackle demand heterogeneities that inherently exist among beneficiaries, causing significant mismatch between 
supply and demand. On the other hand, in this study, we point out that the true demand is hardly known by the HO 
and thus equal distribution can be first taken for fairness concern. To further deal with the mismatch, we borrow the 
idea from exchange economy and facilitate the HO to set up an item barter channel for beneficiaries. To cope with the 
demand uncertainty, we employ data-driven analytics taking advantage of the summary statistics about Ukraine 
refugees during Russo-Ukrainian War and model the demand using moment-based ambiguity set. Consequently, a 
two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework is developed where in the first stage the HO 
purchases and distributes equally among beneficiaries with a fraction of the fixed budget and in the second stage the 
HO promotes relief item exchange among refugees with the remaining budget with the goal of minimizing the worse-
case expected demand shortage cost. The key decision to make for the HO is to budget allocation for each stage. The 
DRO model is reformulated into a mixed-integer linear program and solved via cutting plane algorithm efficiently. 
Numerical experiments show that using a small part of the budget to allow item exchange among refugees could 
further reduce demand shortage compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract 
In this paper, we consider a manual assembly line consisting of multiple stations, each accommodating a worker. 
Collaborative robots (Cobots) are assigned to stations in order to assist the workers by performing part of the workload. 
The role of the cobot is to replace the worker in some of the tasks, such as positioning parts, pick& place, or for 
example, holding an item while the worker performs some task on it. The assembly operation is captured by a 
precedence diagram, consisting of the tasks needed to be done to complete the product, with precedence relations 
among them. Each task can be classified as follows: (1) worker task; (2) cobot task; (3) either task (can be done by 
either the cobot or the worker); (4) concurrent task (needs both the worker and the cobot). The objective is to allocate 
the workload among the workers and cobots, given the line configuration, to minimize the cycle time (or maximize 
the throughput rate). 
The following collaboration types are defined: (1) Independent collaboration: workers and cobots work on separate 
tasks. Each task is solely done by either the human or the cobot; (2) Concurrent collaboration: a worker and a cobot 
perform together the same task (e.g., the cobot holds the part while the human makes some operation); (3) Sequential 
collaboration: two tasks, one done by the worker (cobot) and the other by the cobot (worker) have to be done 
continuously one after the other. 
Given the configuration of workers and cobots, the problem is to assign tasks to workers and cobots while minimizing 
the cycle time. Since the problem is solved for a given configuration, we define dominance rules among configurations 
and show that only non-dominated configurations should be considered. We prove some properties of such 
configurations. Next, a MILP formulation is developed to solve moderate problem sizes. To improve the performance 
of the formulation, we develop some bounds on the cycle time. Then we demonstrate the performance of this 
formulation to solve problems of up to 20 tasks to optimality and up to 50 tasks with a relatively small optimality gap. 
For solving large-scale problems, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic, which 
repeatedly improves an initial solution by destroying and repairing the solution. The former is done by removing tasks 
from the solution, while the latter is done by solving a modified MILP formulation. The performance of the heuristic 
is examined in wide experimentation.

Abstract 
The usability of a website refers to the ease of the system use and the ability of the users to complete their tasks 
efficiently and without error. Websites should be user-friendly while designed to be more multi-functional in 
conjunction with the increasing user necessities. Herein, understanding website usability-related factors becomes 
important in designing such usable systems. In the current study, we aim to provide a systematic approach to 
categorizing website usability factors by referencing the usability problems encountered through a cognitive 
walkthrough approach. In this study, first, the usability problems of a specific website were identified by three experts 
and the problems were rated according to the severity levels, from cosmetic problems to catastrophic problems. Then, 
usability problems were mapped with the website usability factors. In the last step, the categorization of website 
usability factors according to the severity levels was conducted with a cross-tabulation approach, correspondence and 
cluster analyses. As a result, Individualization and User Adaptation(IND), Privacy and Business Policies(PRV), Link 
Design(LNK), Search(SRC), and Help(HLP) were grouped with the severity level of catastrophic problems. These 
factors are the most significant factors that website developers should think about first in the design and evaluation of 
websites.

Introduction 
In the present era of digital technology, websites have become a crucial aspect of our lives, providing a vast amount 
of information and services. Moreover, they are vital for businesses and organizations to establish an online presence 
and connect with their target audience. The usability of a website plays a critical role in engaging users and achieving 
their objectives (Lazar 2005). It refers to the extent a website can be used by its users to accomplish specific goals 
efficiently, effectively, and satisfactorily. According to the research conducted by Nielsen and Loranger (2006), it is 
a quality attribute that evaluates the ease of use of user interfaces. Poor website usability can cause users to feel 
frustrated and ultimately give up on using the site, which can negatively affect a business's overall performance. 
Creating a website is simple, easy to use, and navigating can be challenging for developers. It is revealed that usability 
evaluation is essential in determining a website's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. (ISO 9241-11, 2018; 
Ferreira et al. 2020).  
The importance of website usability has been widely recognised by researchers and practitioners in the field of human-
computer interaction (HCI). According to a study by Nielsen and Loranger (2006), website usability has a direct 
impact on user satisfaction, loyalty, and trust. Users tend to abandon websites that are difficult to use or have poor 
usability, leading to lost business opportunities. It was found that improving website usability can lead to a higher 
conversion rate and increased revenue for online businesses. Moreover, website usability can also have a significant 
impact on user behavior and engagement. It is found that users tend to spend more time on websites with high usability

are not bombarded with excessive options or information (Bodoff and Ho 2015).  By the findings in the literature 
(Martin et al. 2021; Bodoff and Ho 2015; Briggs et al. 2004; Venkatesh and Ramesh 2006; Bodoff and Ho 2015), the 
factors related to tailored experience in terms of individualization and user adaptation is significant in eliminating 
catastrophic website usability problems.  
 
Another factor in eliminating significant usability problems in website design is related to privacy. This finding is 
similar to the findings in the literature (Dabrowski et al. 2014; Proctor et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2012; Brunetto et al., 
2022). According to Dabrowski et al. (2014), there is a risk associated with customers serving themselves through a 
website, as they may not be adequately trained to do so (Dabrowski et al. 2014). In the study of Proctor et al. (2008), 
it is revealed that most privacy policies are addressed to more educated users, which means that the likelihood of an 
average user understanding them is quite low. Thus, it is argued in the study of Miller et al. (2012) that numerous 
issues arise when users do not completely comprehend a website's privacy practices or fail to use the privacy features 
to align with their objectives. Therefore, it is important to obtain users' understanding of privacy policies and their 
attitudes toward the policies and the websites they are hosted on to ensure effective usability. Additionally, the findings 
in the study of Brunotte et al. (2022) aid users in locating privacy policies more quickly and facilitates a better 
understanding of the pertinent information.   
 
Another important website usability factor is having predictable and consistently working links that help users easily 
identify clickable elements and understand where each link will take them. According to W3C (2008), proficiently 
crafted links can facilitate efficient navigation for website users, while inadequately crafted links can confuse. 
Research by Nielsen (1999) and Kirschner et al. (2011) has shown that utilizing descriptive links instead of generic 
phrases can enhance users' comprehension of the link's destination and confidence in the website.  
 
The search function that conforms to usability is found to be important in the design of a usable website. Similarly, 
Zhang and Adipat (2005) found that the search functionality can improve the overall user experience by providing a 
sense of control to the user (Zhang and Adipat 2005). When users cannot find what they are looking for, they may feel 
powerless and disoriented. Visser and Weideman's (2014) research showed a complementary relationship between 
website usability and search engine optimization.  
 
Although this study proposed a way to understand the significant factors in the design of a website, as a further study, 
we have some recommendations. First, the usability problems were defined by analyzing one type of website. This 
study can be enhanced by including different types of websites to generalize the findings. Furthermore, more usability 
problems may be defined by extending this study. Besides, the usability problems may be collected from the real users 
of the websites through user testing to get the opinions of another group of stakeholders, not only from experts. 
Additionally, the group differences may be analyzed by collecting data from real users, experts and website 
programmers. By doing so, whether the usability problems encountered by these groups differ from each other may 
be revealed.

Abstract 
Background: Over the past few decades, the expenditure in healthcare industry has been escalating global-wide. To 
reduce waste and pursue efficiency, quality and profitability gains as well as to be more responsive to market 
demand, it is proposed by scholars to combine lean and agility together as leagility to improve performance of the 
healthcare supply chain. 
Purpose: This study aims at synthesizing the extant literature in leagility in the healthcare industry in a comprehensive 
way. The purpose of the paper is threefold. First, to present and categorize leagility research in the healthcare industry. 
Second, to review the literature in terms of healthcare leagility definitions, barriers and enablers, and expected results. 
Third, identify potential research gaps. 
Research design: This systematic literature review is conducted following the PRISMA checklist approach. After 
screening, 23 articles we considered for the analysis. Descriptive analysis and content analysis are used.  
Findings: It is found that the leagile strategy is applicable to supply chains of high complexity and high risk, where 
products are of long lead-time, high demand variability and high perishability. Prerequisites and impediments of 
leagility are categorized according to their nature. There are 11 target areas identified in leagility application in the 
healthcare industry. Limited cooperation between different authors is observed in current studies.  
Conclusion: Leagility in healthcare settings is still lacking empirical validation and awaits for further development. 
Thus, the application of leagility in a specific sub-sector under the healthcare setting is appealed for.

Abstract 
To increase the Portuguese e-waste household collection rate, more excellent knowledge of how consumers manage 
their end-of-life electronic equipment is necessary. This study aims to understand Portuguese citizens' current 
consumption trends, how they dispose of their e-electronic appliances, and how much they know about e-waste and 
its implication on the environment. This analysis was carried out in two steps: first, a questionnaire was administered 
in Portugal, and the findings were analyzed. Secondly, a statistical analysis was conducted to find an association 
between consumer behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. The outputs show that age, education, 
employment, family size, employment, and income are significantly associated with consumption, disposal, and 
awareness. Large appliances hold the highest percentage of household equipment, followed by small appliances and 
IT and Telecommunication equipment, and the average substitution time is four years. A slight but non-indifferent 
tendency shows consumers are willing to buy second-handed equipment. Moreover, regarding disposal, there is still 
the tendency to abandon large equipment on the street and store small items for sentimental or future-usage reasons. 
Incentives are appreciated, such as cash-back and discounts on new-green items. Other than the practices already in 
existence in Portugal, the government, policymakers, municipalities, and PRO must raise awareness in different ways 
among the sociodemographic classes studied to correct bad habits and increase recycling properly.

Green construction is a sustainable movement that aims to create environmentally friendly construction starting from 
the planning, implementation, to the use of construction materials that are environmentally friendly and efficient in 
the use of resources. This study aims to examine the implementation of green construction strategies in construction 
projects in Jakarta, as well as analyze the optimization of sustainable green construction strategies post Covid-19 
pandemic. This research is qualitative research using a case study approach. Primary data was obtained through in-
depth interviews and FGD. Construction companies in Jakarta are expected to have concrete actions to optimize green 
construction strategies, one of which is strategic action by using green technology in construction. The strategy of 
green construction companies is to take innovative steps in creating environmentally friendly construction by using 
efficient resources to create environmentally friendly green construction. The next strategy is sustainability action, in 
which green construction companies try to create environmental sustainability so that the role of innovators in the 
field of green construction is needed, especially for construction companies that apply green technology. The main 
strategies are financial benefits for stakeholders, public policies in facilitating green construction, government support 
and knowledge development in green construction. Comprehensive and well-planned sustainable green construction 
management is a long-term investment for the construction industry. To achieve the sustainability of the green 
construction industry, companies that use green technology play an important role. Supported by using the ISPHI 
method, they can become leading innovators in implementing post-Covid-19 sustainable green construction strategies 
in Jakarta.

1. Introduction
As a developing country, Indonesia is experiencing rapid development in various sectors, especially the construction 
industry. The construction industry cannot be separated from the application of technology. The higher rate of business 
growth and the need for infrastructure from before has created a new problem, namely pollution which is increasing 
along with the increase in industry, especially in Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia which is still experiencing 
growth both in terms of economy and population density (www.thejakartapost.com).  
Regulations related to sustainable and comprehensive green construction are considered as a new regulatory rule that 
must be applied, even though Indonesia has long been trying to build a sustainable green development ecosystem. 
Regulations regarding green construction are still in the socialization stage. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the 
government's attention was shifted to the health sector and active in strategic actions for the country's economic 
recovery, so that this caused the development of sustainable construction regulations to be slightly hampered. During 
the pandemic it also caused several long-term strategies that support the implementation of sustainable green 
construction, such as increasing public-private sector collaboration and increasing the value of green construction 
being delayed in implementation (Ministry of PUPR, 2021). On the positive side is that the pandemic has increased 
public awareness of the importance of creating green construction and a healthy environment.

d) Human resources: human resources with integrity, creative and innovative in green construction management 
supported by skills, analytical abilities, and in-depth knowledge of green construction implementation 
systems; and 
e) Integrated management system: an integrated system towards sustainable green construction management. 
Apart from that, another strategy that can be carried out is to apply a solid and clear foundation in a sustainable 
construction ecosystem, one of which is by implementing long-term macroeconomic policies that can later support 
green construction companies to survive and be sustainable. Apart from that, it can also begin to develop elements of 
strategic partnerships with stakeholders in the government and private sectors which are the targets of developing the 
green construction industry sector. Therefore, green construction is needed as a solution to save the environment. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The construction industry needs to re-engineer construction management by adjusting and transforming itself into 
green construction to complete work effectively, efficiently and at the right time to achieve sustainable optimal results. 
Green construction here means implementing a construction process that is efficient in terms of all resources used and 
can be responsible for the surrounding environment to be able to ensure the sustainability of the green ecosystem that 
is created through the implemented green construction. Especially in the context of green construction sustainability 
implies a cycle of operation, site design, maintenance, repair, and demolition with minimal environmental damage. 
The process does require close collaboration between green construction engineers, architects, governments, and 
clients across all green construction projects. The green construction concept aims to ensure cost-effective building 
construction methods and should be able to reduce the overall effect on negative environmental impacts, as well as 
always prioritize human health, through its focus is on implementing the efficient use of green energy and resources, 
conservation of water and energy savings, occupational health, minimizing pollution and existing construction waste. 
 
It is hoped that the positive impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on policies and changes that have occurred in the 
construction sector will be one of the drivers of Indonesia's post-pandemic economic growth, especially for 
construction companies in the Jakarta area. Therefore, it is important to develop an integrated strategy to develop an 
overall end-to-end green construction strategy to enable sustainable goals to be achieved. The construction industry 
needs to re-engineer construction management by adjusting and transforming itself in the industrial era 4.0 where 
technological support is necessary to complete project strategies effectively, efficiently, and achieve sustainable 
optimal results.  
 
A well-organized green construction organization will produce less waste, so it is very important for the organization 
to develop a detailed strategy on optimizing green construction strategies to increase the productivity and efficiency 
of the company, where the company must also be environmentally responsible by sourcing concrete actions to provide 
solutions to future green construction problems.  
 
Comprehensive and well-planned sustainable green construction management is a long-term investment for the 
construction industry. The proposed green construction development using the ISPHI method is expected to be the 
right strategic guideline to strengthen sustainable principles in proper handling and optimize the implementation of 
post-Covid-19 sustainable green construction strategies in Jakarta.

Abstract 
Lithium, a lightweight metal, is used in various applications such as batteries, cell phones, ceramics, glass, and bipolar 
disorder medications. It’s been brought to worldwide attention due to its high charge storage capacity in small places. 
However, concerns arise regarding the environmental and social impact of lithium extraction near mining 
communities. Issues include groundwater depletion, land destruction and community displacement. This study aims 
to develop a dynamic model using machine learning algorithms to measure the socio-economic and environmental 
impact of lithium mining projects. The proposed dynamic model reveals that, if keeping demand and production as of 
today, lithium mining will become an irresponsible practice by 2040. Hence, it is crucial to implement policies like 
battery recycling, reforestation initiatives by mining entities, and potential production limitations to ensure a 
sustainable lithium industry.

1. Introduction
Lithium has been used in different applications ranging from pharmaceutical products to the manufacture of air 
treatment systems. Recently there has been an increasing use from the commercial boom of lithium-ion batteries, 
which are used both in electronic items for personal use such as computers and telephones and in the electric vehicle 
market. It is precisely in this category where its main driver of demand lies. Although it is a market with relatively 
low penetration, its growth in recent years has been explosive and its annual sales are expected to grow in the order 
of an average compound annual rate of 27% towards the end of the decade (González and Cantallopts 2021). 
On the other hand, it is worth noting the importance that lithium mining has obtained in recent years, thanks to this 
element various uses of it are derived; in which it stands out more for the creation of electric batteries, which have 
been one of the clean energy trends for the benefit of the environment. However, there has also been great uncertainty 
about the effects within mining communities; the exploitation of this mineral within the countries involved has been 
affected both positively and negatively. 
It is thanks to this growth in demand by various industries, among which the automotive industry stands out for the 
use of lithium in the batteries used in electric cars, that the need to exploit lithium in increasing quantities, creation of 
new lithium mines and expansion of existing ones naturally follows. As it is a natural resource, it is pertinent to 
consider the impact that the practice of extracting it has on its environment.

Abstract 
There is a growing interest in the concept of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which supports a transition towards a more sustainable, 
resilient and human-oriented industrial paradigm. This paper focuses on the I5.0 sustainability pillar, which is crucial 
to optimize and support I5.0’s data-driven and circular supply chains.  
In order to pursue a Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC) and improve data quality management across it, it is first 
imperative to understand to what extent the existing SSC quality indicators are aligned with the opportunities of the 
digitalization era, and if they support the path to I5.0 sustainable practices. This paper aims to do a comprehensive 
study and analysis of relevant groups of SSC metrics and indicators. Through a broad literature review, SSC metrics 
and indicators are identified. Then, they are assessed to determine if they are suitable and relevant to assist decision 
makers in the challenges towards SSC 5.0.  
Results reveal that despite growing interest in the progress of data-driven SSC in recent years, there are still research 
gaps, mainly concerning the standardization of indicators, the simplification of models, and the use of consistent 
models for the treatment and conversion of proper data into relevant information.

1. Introduction
Industry is changing at an ever-increasing speed (Schwab and Davis 2018). However, industrial development 
indicators are based on economic principles, defined in the middle of the 20th century, emphasizing the returns to 
shareholders (EU Directorate-General for R&I et al. 2021). The paradigm is shifting towards the ideal of stakeholder 
value, reinforcing the role and the contribution of industry to society at large, rather than to the benefit of a few 
(Callaghan 2020, EU Directorate-General for R&I et al. 2021). 
Industry 4.0 has focused on advanced technologies to optimize processes and increase efficiency (Ivascu 2020, Liu 
and Lin 2021, Rad et al. 2022). However, there have been some concerns about the dehumanization of the workplace 
and the social and environmental impacts of this approach (Callaghan 2020, Rad et al. 2022, Raja Santhi and 
Muthuswamy 2023). The concept of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) addresses some of these issues by emphasizing sustainability, 
human-orientation and resilience (EU Directorate-General for R&I et al. 2021). I5.0 involves a shift towards more 
collaborative, customized, and flexible production processes that values human intelligence and creativity, pursuing 
optimization between technological progress and human well-being (Longo et al. 2020).

Abstract 
With the fourth industrial revolution, the increased trend of digitalization of production processes and products 
resulted in more data regarding processes and products becoming available. For data-driven strategies like Lean Six 
Sigma to deal with the amount of data available today, it requires integrating a new set of tools and techniques from 
the Data Science research field. However, the fact that more data is available does not necessarily translate into more 
efficient and effective processes. For that, it is necessary to identify what is useful and can be transformed into value 
and what is not. Following the DMAIC cycle, the project presented in this article focuses on improving a production 
station of an Optical Bonding production line that produces flat panel displays for the automotive industry. The 
inclusion of Data Science tools and techniques tools in this improvement project helped to extract and analyze 
information from unstructured log files. The achieved results of this project show that the combination of data science 
tools with traditional process improvement tools and methodologies is very productive.

Introduction 
As a consequence of the fourth industrial revolution, the increased trend of digitalization production processes and 
products resulted in the availability of more data regarding processes and products became available, be it for design, 
management, control or monitoring purposes (Cattaneo et al. 2018; Titmarsh et al. 2020). Business industries such as 
aerospace, semiconductor, or display devices are good examples of manufacturing industries that often involve 
complex production processes that create a larger variety and volumes of production data (Zheng et al. 2014). 
However, the naive fact that more data is available does not mean that processes are becoming more efficient and 
effective. For that, it is necessary to take advantage of such availability and pinpoint what is useful and can be 
transformed into value and what is not. Furthermore, the unending development and usage of sensors and measurement 
techniques will continue to allow the collection and storage of large volumes of data of each individual equipment in 
any complex engineering systems, to discover new correlations of data and operating status(Coccia et al. 2021). As a

3.5 Control phase - Results Summary and Discussion 
When the improvement project team decided to wrap up the project in August 2021, the dispensing station 
manufacturer did not have the chance to perform the required changes on the station. Therefore the new parameters 
were not being monitored yet. However, by that time it was possible to confirm that after changes made to the 
software's rules that manage the entire production line, The “Time to Last Station” variable average had dropped 
nearly 10 seconds per unit, increasing the station output. Also, production was more evenly distributed between the 
three assembly stations. These improvements impacted the entire production line output. An increase in output of 
about 32 pcs/shift was recorded, each meant an increase of 7.3% in shift production capacity. 
 
In addition, and although this was not defined as one of the project objectives, the development and implementation 
of an ETL process using a data science tool to transform an unstructured machine log into a structured, organized and 
tabular log allowed the company to identify new parameters for improving control, bugs and outdated data that were 
being collected and store unnecessarily. Moreover, it is the improvement project team belief that this is not the only 
station on the production line that collects, records and stores information in unstructured logs, suggesting that the 
developed ETL process for the improvement project can be used as a baseline for projects that involve handling similar 
unstructured machine logs. 
 
Final Conclusions 
Undoubtedly, the combination of data science tools with traditional process improvement tools and methodologies is 
very prolific. Although it would be possible to develop such an improvement project with other softwares, it would 
not be easy to develop this project within the desirable timeframe without the help and inclusion of some data science 
and data mining tools. The inclusion of such helped not only to extract several information from unstructured source 
files, but also to transform and organize it in a structured manner.  
Furthermore, this was done considering large amounts of data to process (or at least large enough for traditional 
improvement projects). However, it was also shown that a considerable amount of the information extracted from the 
logs was of no-good use. It was due to the experience and knowledge of the process experts that “the dots were 
connected” and value insights were taken from the available data, converting these insights into improvement actions 
that contributed to increasing the production output.

Abstract 
The reliability of power supply by South African coal-fired power plants has become the central focus of many areas 
of governments’ strategic planning. The reason for this is its poor maintenance, unplanned outages, increased 
generator trips and lack of adequate skills. The impact of the above shortcomings is increased load shedding, 
insufficient electricity in the country, high cable theft, low production in manufacturing industries and insufficient 
photovoltaic energy produced in grid-tie system configurations. Thus, this work tends to demonstrate the need for 
improving the existing coal power plants to increase the amount of solar energy in the national grid. The historical 
data was collected from plant failures, generator asset management, maintenance strategies and unplanned capability 
loss factors. This data was analyzed through qualitative and quantitative research methods. The results obtained from 
the proposed methodology show that inadequate training of employees, skills shortages, unavailability of quality 
spares, and lack of maintenance are some of the major contributing factors to plant breakdowns and failures. 
Furthermore, research has revealed that a preventative maintenance strategy is the most recommended strategy to 
improve generator plant reliability instead of a corrective maintenance strategy that is currently used and found to be 
ineffective and inappropriate.

1. Introduction
Compared to many other countries with several power utility companies, the supply of electricity in South Africa is 
generated and transmitted by a single monopoly state-owned power utility (Khobail et al 2017). However, electricity 
distribution is shared between several entities. The electrical energy generated by the South African power utility is 
approximately 90% of the total electricity generated in the country. The remaining 10% of electricity is generated 
through renewable energy comprising wind, solar and water. Renewable energies such as solar systems are a great 
energy alternative to coal-fired power plants because they can be used concurrently with coal-fired power plants to 
reduce the power generated from pollutant raw materials such as coal by maintaining the demand capacity at the 
requested level. This implementation technique is usually done through a grid-tie system. At present, there are many 
shortcomings experienced by the South African power utility. These include asset breakdowns, tripping of units, 
increased generator failures, higher unplanned capability loss factors, and forced outages. Certain sectors of economic 
importance are highly dependent on reliable electrical power for their productivity and functionality. Major economic 
sectors like mining industries have been severely affected by the continuing electricity blackouts in South Africa (du 
Venage 2020).  
The importance of electricity supply to the health care system must not be underestimated. Electricity shortages result 
in patients’ health degeneration, extended illness, and death (Ndaguba 2016). Khobail et al. (2016) suggest that 
electricity generated is the key aspect of the country’s economic growth. Electricity is generated, transmitted, and 
distributed to key sectors of the economy like mining, agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors (Dhillon 2007). 
Therefore, the effects of unreliable power supply can negatively impact the economy and result in a loss of 
employment and poverty, even when renewable energy penetration is high. This is because a reference voltage has to 
be provided to the inverters in a case of a grid-tie solar system to transfer the power produced from the solar to the

damage. Technology-driven organizations have seen increased plant production, ease of maintenance, organized data 
collection, improved working conditions, and fewer incidents, and accidents. Technology has advanced plant 
operation beyond reasonable doubt and continues to add value to the generation of electricity. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Results indicated that plant breakdowns and failures are due to delayed maintenance and outages. Proposed 
improvements include ensuring outages and maintenance are conducted on a routine basis by competent and skilled 
workers. Power generating plants are in a crisis of aging infrastructure that can no longer be maintained but must be 
improved through refurbishment and the installation of new equipment in the plants. Improved maintenance asset 
management strategies will directly result in improved availability, reliability, and plant utilization. The technology 
currently installed in the plants is old and obsolete. Improved technology will offer real-time plant performance and 
plant failures can be detected even before they create serve damage. 
 
6. Conclusion 
There is a high demand for reliable electrical supply from the continuously growing population in the world. Many 
business sectors have declared losses in profits and revenues due to the unavailability of reliable power supply. Several 
strategies and procedures have been developed by the power utilities in support of maintenance departments and 
projects to ensure the improvement of plant maintenance and performance. The power utilities are underperforming 
despite the investment of large amounts of money in maintenance and outage budgets.  
 
From the data collected, results obtained and analyzed in this study it is shown that power utilities have been and are 
still experiencing a continued high rate of plant breakdowns and failures over the past years. The plant failures 
comprise boiler, turbine, and generator failures which result in the unavailability and unreliability of electricity supply. 
Various plant breakdowns and maintenance are due to poor maintenance, delayed maintenance, and outages. In 
addition, some of the contributing factors to poor plant performance are lack of adequate skills, training, aging 
infrastructure, and non-availability of quality spares. Asset management strategy and maintenance strategy, 
particularly corrective maintenance strategy applied to coal power plants are futile, ineffective, and inappropriate 
strategies that could lead to continued load shedding. 
 
It is recommended to improve maintenance and minimize delays on scheduled outages by conducting regular 
inspections and preventative maintenance. The aging infrastructure that can no longer be maintained must be 
refurbished and new equipment with improved technology installed to monitor plant performance. Skills gap analysis 
must be performed to assess the skills shortages of personnel as well as the level of competency to assist maintenance 
departments to allocate budgets for the training and development of employees. Doing this will help to have a reference 
voltage for solar plants compulsory to the national regulator for a grid-tie inverter to produce electricity. Thus, the 
amount of solar energy produced will help to improve the grid’s stability.

ABSTRACT 
Over the years South African railway company embarked on a Market Demand Strategy (MDS), a capital 
investment program for expanding the organization’s infrastructure. The MDS entailed many programs, with one 
of them being the 81 million tons per annum (mtpa) program, which was baselined to be finished by September 
2017, but the electrical power upgrade cluster was delayed. The current research determined the root causes of 
delays in railway substation projects. The research presented preventative measures and mitigations suitable to 
address the root causes of delays. The study was conducted through semi-structured interviews to obtain primary 
data and review the project administrative database to obtain secondary data. The study revealed thirty-three root 
causes of delays in the undertaken railway substation project. Furthermore, the study proposed comprehensive 
preventative measures and remedial actions to manage delays in railway substation projects.

1. Introduction
Project success is explained by meeting the iron triangle requirements within cost, quality, and schedule (Masood 
2015). A small number of projects are finished within the originally approved schedule and cost (Singh 2010). A 
delay is the time past the date of completion defined in the contract or past the date commonly agreed on by parties 
for the delivery of the project (Zack 2003). Contractors, owners, third parties, or force majeure (Vasilyeva-Lyulina 
et al. 2015) are all possible causes of project delays. 
Masood (2015) recommended the following remedial actions to the delays in railway construction projects: the 
implementation of risk assessment for unfavorable weather conditions, careful selection of contractors, proper 
scheduling, and planning, and ensuring timely payments, design, and approvals. Singh (2010) suggested that 
project size and implementation stage be a minimum where necessary and extensive contract management takes 
place during execution. 
1.1 Statement of the Problem and Objectives 
The export coal expansion to 81 million tons per annum (mtpa) program consists of several projects and it was 
planned to be completed by September 2017. By March 2018 the program was 80,1% complete (Transnet Freight 
Rail 2018). By that time the project was already delayed by 1.025 years. None of the new Direct Current (DC) 
substations met their approved baseline dates. According to Xaba (2011), 55% of South African railway major 
projects undertaken between 2005 and 2011 did not meet their objectives. The research aims focused on 
determining the main causes of project delays within the coal 81mtpa program through a new DC substations case 
study. 
The study objectives were to (1) determine the root causes of delays in the new DC substations in the railway 
environment, and (2) to further suggest and recommend, remedial actions and mitigations.

Schedule Management 
• 
Lengthy approval process by multiple people in the railway company (late approval 
process). 
• 
Delays or late in acquiring EIA and WULA. 
• 
Late/lengthy property acquisition. 
• 
Poor planning for occupation (cancellation and non-granting occupation). 
• 
Delay in the land occupation/site access. 
 
7.2 Recommendations 
 
The study findings from consolidated interviews and archival data recommended the following mitigation and 
remedial actions that could be adopted and implemented in the substation railway projects to address the root 
causes of delays: 
 
• 
Educate top managers to enforce the project life cycle fully. 
• 
Conduct scope workshops and design checks before tendering. 
• 
Proper evaluation of contractors during tendering to select the people who understand and can do the job. 
• 
Stop the contractor on site when not complying with the specifications. 
• 
Have a weekly risk meeting to check the progress of the risks identified. 
• 
Have a repository of lessons learned in the organization, learn from what has happened, and implement it 
earlier in planning the next project. 
• 
Allow communications transfers from feasibility study to execution. 
• 
Conduct land research, zoning, and transfer of land. 
• 
Operations must allow enough time (outages) for project execution. 
• 
Don't use old equipment from the depots. 
• 
Implement project life cycle fully (inclusive of EIA and Permit); it is designed to provide a high probability of 
success for projects. 
• 
Involve all stakeholders at feasibility or earlier. 
• 
Avoid advance payments and manage suppliers of contractors. 
• 
Conduct proper project planning well in advance (schedule contractual compliance, follow project schedule). 
• 
Conduct site planning to identify any risks on site (site constraints and plan for alternative access method). 
• 
On-site assessment by experts to determine all scope and risks before occupation application. 
• 
Delegation of responsibilities to other competent persons. 
• 
Train more resources and test engineers. 
• 
All scope should be included in the business case during feasibility and signed off by all stakeholders. 
• 
The drawing coordinator should be nominated to satisfy all internal stakeholders for quicker drawing acceptance. 
• 
Recruit competent staff. The incentive to retain staff. 
• 
Insurance to cover theft. In the tender process specify suitable security measures and ensure compliance. 
• 
Keep alert of planned national industrial action. 
 
The feedback from the interview data recommended the following management approaches to manage the root 
causes of delays in the railway substation project: 
 
• 
Management should not bypass the stages of project lifecycle processes because of the pressure.  
• 
Management should set up realistic project targets. 
• 
Business leaders are to have awareness and understanding of projects and their performance scorecard 
should be project measured. 
• 
Put competent people in place to run the project early on during the inception stage. 
• 
Encourage full implementation of the PLP with gate reviews. 
• 
Spend much time coordinating, controlling, and organizing all project team members. 
• 
Micromanage the project and try to know every detail of the project. 
• 
Improve stakeholder engagement, risk assessment, and communication. 
• 
Encourage the appointment of a competent contractor that knows the culture of the organization. 
• 
Encourage proper planning. 
• 
Conduct more project monitoring and have fortnightly project meetings instead of monthly. 
8. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the overall study achieved the objectives and answered the research questions sufficiently, by 
identifying the 33 root causes of delays within the new DC substations and ranking the top five root causes of delays. 
Furthermore, 23 mitigations and remedial actions were recommended, that could be adopted and implemented in 
the substation railway projects to address the root causes of delays. In addition, the study suggested management 
approaches and ways that can be implemented to reduce and mitigate delays within coal portfolio infrastructure

Abstract 
Quality management is crucial to the companies so that they can maintain and enhance their competitive advantage 
towards the market. In this context, the quality managers play a fundamental role and is important that they have the 
necessary competences to do their job. However, the competences for the quality management are not a subject broadly 
discussed in the academy, despite its presence in the professional literature. In order to address this issue, the present 
study aims to perform a mapping of the academic literature regarding the competences for quality management 
through a bibliometric analysis complemented by a content analysis. As results, the main authors, journals, and themes 
related to this area were identified, as well as the main dimensions of competence and the main research gaps to guide 
future studies.

1. Introduction
Quality management increasingly adopts a leading role in leveraging the competitive advantage of the companies, 
especially in the digitalization era (Jason et al.  2023). In general, it contributes to maintaining the competitive 
advantage by promoting the development of specific skills and producing complex social relationships that are directly 
related to the history and culture of the company (Escrig-Tena and Bou-Llusar 2005; Perez-Arostegui et al. 2012). 
Recognition of the importance of quality management competencies is not new. Since Jonker (1999), it is perceived 
the need for companies, institutions and organizations to deal with the quality of their products and services, being 
such competencies fundamental to this process. However, its role becomes increasingly critical in maintaining 
competitive advantage and increasing the performance of organizations (Bolatan et al. 2022), since failures in quality 
improvement programs are not usually associated with basic failures in quality principles, but rather with a lack of 
skills and inefficient deployment systems (Huq  2006). 
To avoid these shortcomings, quality management competencies have become a focal point of development in 
companies (Khanna and Gupta 2014), being directly related to quality managers. These professionals may assume 
different roles from one organization to another, but in general their function is to ensure that products and services 
are adherent to the objectives and requirements of internal and external stakeholders (Ingason and Jónsdóttir 2017). 
There is a gradual change in the vision of a quality manager with a merely inspector role for someone who is integrated 
into the managerial role (Elg et al. 2011), which requires a constant update in their competencies (Jason et al., 2023). 
Despite the vast existing literature on competencies (Ellström 1997; Hecklau et al. 2016; Katz  1955; Le Deist and 
Winterton 2005), the topic of quality management competencies is virtually non-existent (Martin et al. 2021).

5. Conclusions 
The objective of this article was to map the area of competencies for quality management through a bibliometric 
analysis combined with a content analysis. Our findings suggests that, in general, the literature on competencies for 
quality management has been developing over the years, although there are still many gaps that need to be filled. The 
field presents a very pulverized structure, without a solid theoretical basis that permeates the studies that integrate it. 
Despite this, the field is presenting developments when interacting with other areas of knowledge such as Industry 4.0 
and information technology. 
 
In a theoretical way, the study contributes with the indication of the main authors, journals, and themes for the field, 
in addition to pointing out the main dimensions of competencies treated and research gaps, in order to guide future 
researchers who wish to contribute to the theme. From a practical point of view, this article helps to structure the 
existing knowledge about the competencies for quality management, in addition to guiding professionals in the area 
on the main dimensions of competencies, necessary for a quality manager. 
 
Despite the authors' efforts to obtain the most complete sample possible, this study has limitations directly related to 
the databases and methodological choices regarding the search strings, filters and databases used. In addition, the 
sample selection process had the analysis of only two researchers, which may instill a bias to the data due to the non-
existence of several evaluators and eventual choices by consensus. 
 
As opportunities for future research, in addition to those mentioned in section 4, there is a need to identify the main 
competencies addressed in each of the dimensions presented by the researchers to seek and understand eventual 
correlations between the dimensions of competence presented. In addition, it is necessary a theoretical study about the 
definitions of competence used by the various researchers, to obtain a more general definition for each of them, aiming 
to direct the field of study to a common theoretical basis.

Abstract 
The airline industry derives a substantial portion of its ancillary revenue from baggage fees. However, it has not 
utilized a controlled and structured approach to baggage pricing. Airlines have been using different pricing strategies, 
such as flat rate pricing or weight-based pricing, without considering the actual cost allocation for providing those 
services, resulting in overcharging or undercharging scenarios.  This study discusses the application of non-atomic 
game theory in pricing strategy for a joint cost setting in passenger baggage transportation. Cost allocation-based 
pricing can provide a “fair” approach to pricing these services and will be widely accepted by the passengers. Aumann-
Shapley price is an application of non-atomic game theory that involves finding fair prices for divisible goods where 
each infinitesimally divisible good is considered a separate player in the game. We demonstrate that this pricing 
approach for baggage services will be helpful in generating prices based on the weight and volume consumption of a 
passenger, which are the players in the continuum for this game. The concept of “Chargeable-capacity” is adopted in 
our research to postulate axioms that will generate prices that are cost-covering, positive, and aggregation invariant. 
Although the prices are calculated only on a portion of the total capacity, they satisfy the budget-balance requirement 
by charging a penalty to the capacity consumptions beyond the free limit. Pricing functions can be considered linear 
functionals and satisfy the absolute continuity property to represent an integrable function.  
This idea is used to prove that the pricing mechanism proposed by us satisfies all the pricing axioms. To differentiate 
between the prices of pre-booked and on-site baggage, we extend the axioms further to provide an Advance-purchase 
discount and ensure the pre-booked excess baggage is charged lower as compared to the on-spot bookings. Various 
cost functions are examined to support our claims and establish the robustness of the pricing mechanism. We also 
compare the weighted value prices with the Ramsey-Boeitux rule to establish the relationship between the weights 
and the price elasticity of demand for pre-booked and on-spot baggage services. It is justifiable to assume that pre-
booked baggage is more price elastic than spot-booked baggage, as pre-booked baggage is usually purchased well in 
advance, giving customers more time to compare prices and make informed decisions. This gives us the idea that the 
weight for pre-booked baggage is less than the spot bookings. Any differentiable joint-cost function satisfies the rules 
stated in our research, and findings imply that prices will rely on consumption patterns and the proportion of 
chargeable capacity selected by the airline. The pricing mechanism encompasses all aspects of baggage price and 
permits airlines to offer variable weight and volume allowances. The proposed method is extendable to comparable 
cases such as railway and road freight services.

Abstract 
This paper deals with a traveling salesman problem that is performed daily by a Portuguese bakery company. The 
bakery delivers bread to multiple customers using only one vehicle and driver, leading to high costs and time 
consumption. The objective is to minimize total travel distance and optimize the distribution process to reduce costs. 
In this case, we have a typical Traveling Salesman Problem and in order to solve this problem, several solutions were 
first computed and compared, and then, these were used as initial solutions to a Simulated Annealing (SA) approach. 
The performance of the SA was tested for the real problem, with the actual company data and, an analysis of the SA 
behavior when started with different solutions was performed. The results obtained allowed the company to reduce its 
current route by more than 23%.

1. Introduction
Currently, globalization of markets contributes to an increasing competitiveness requiring organizations to 
continuously improve their performance. To this end, it is necessary to adopt an adequate logistics planning in order 
to reduce costs and achieve competitive advantage.  
The transport sector is undoubtedly one of the most important and costly components of logistics activities, and it is 
therefore fundamental that companies have a well-designed and efficient distribution network. This leads to a strong 
and growing concern from several organizations in different sectors, to search for optimized routes that allow them to 
provide their services with the desired quality, in the shortest period of time and with the lowest cost possible, in order 
to maximize profits.  
It is in this context that the Travelling Salesman Problem, the main topic of this article, arises. This is a Combinatorial 
Optimization problem whose objective consists in defining a route that has the shortest distance and/or shortest 
duration and, consequently, the lowest cost. According to Gilbert Laporte (Laporte 1992), in general, the methods 
used to solve this problem can be divided into exact and heuristic methods. The exact methods make it possible to 
obtain the optimal solution to the problem, however, as they have exponential complexity order, the computational 
effort for its resolution increases exponentially with the number of nodes to be visited. For this reason, researchers’

Finally, it should be noted that the best solution is achieved when the SA starts with the NN-EI solution, with 65.345 
meters. Furthermore, comparing this solution with the route currently traveled by the bread distributor, it was possible 
to see that there is an improvement of 23%, since there is a reduction of 20.718 meters to the route. Thus, if we 
consider the currently average speed used by the bread distributor, 22.65 km/h, we see that this saving is equivalent 
to about an hour of work, so this should be the route to implement from now on. 
 
6. Summary and conclusions 
This paper presents an efficient approach to solve a Travelling Salesman Problem by applying the Simulated 
Annealing metaheuristic. The main objective sought was to reduce the route currently taken by the bread distributor 
of a Portuguese bakery and, for this, several initial solutions were computed to be considered as an initial solution for 
the SA. To determine these initial solutions, several methods were used, including Clarke and Wright's heuristic and 
the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. 
 
The results obtained allowed us to conclude that, in fact, by applying Simulated Annealing it is possible to improve 
the current route made by the distributor. It was also possible to conclude that the best solution is achieved when the 
SA uses the NN-EI initial solution. Thus, it is suggested that this route should be implemented since it’s shorter and 
reduces distribution time and associated costs. 
 
The proposed goal was achieved: the total distance to be covered for the distribution of bread to 195 customers is 
reduced in more or less 20 km, which corresponds to more than 23% of the initial route’s length.

Moreover, this study provides relevant information about the behavior of Simulated Annealing in different scenarios 
that can be useful for future research about the application of this metaheuristic to the Travelling Salesman Problem 
and other combinatorial optimization applications. Thus, as a suggestion for future research, we propose the 
application of other metaheuristics as well as the use of other methods to obtain initial solutions.

Abstract 
This paper aims to study a cutting problem inherent to the modelling process of a textile company and find a solution 
that minimizes fabric waste. Thus, several heuristics were adopted, whose results allowed inferring about the 
company’s current condition, i.e., whether the current solution adopted is effective in minimizing fabric waste. The 
heuristics have been tested, analyzed, and compared using a pre-existing database. Following this hypothetico-
deductive method, the initial heuristic and its improvements were subsequently applied to the real problem. Regarding 
the solutions, the 1st heuristic presented the worst solution, as expected, and the subsequent heuristics (2nd-5th) 
presented continuous improvements of approximately 5% compared to their predecessors. Based on the results, it was 
found that the created heuristics did not generate better solutions than the current one adopted by the company (H = 
4.04m), i.e., its solution is robust and effective, considering the company's objective. However, the successive 
improvements made to the heuristics allowed generating of good solutions comparable to the ones given by the 
specialized software.

1. Introduction
The Portuguese textile company is headquartered in the district of Viseu and employs 165 co-workers. It offers a 
bespoke tailoring service that aims to provide personalized experiences. 
The products are designed using four distinct process phases: 
•
Modelling - This first phase involves creating patterns for the pieces on the cutting plan (raw material) using CAD
and CAM tools, to use the least amount of material for the largest number of pieces.
•
Cutting - This sector is crucial to ensure product quality and accuracy in the measurements of each piece.
•
Assembly - After cutting and labelling, the different subcomponents of the piece (such as collars, sleeves, and
lining) are sent to their specific assembly lines.
•
Finishing - In this phase, the suits undergo finishing operations such as ironing, and any defects are analyzed.
This work proposes an optimization for the modelling phase. In this phase the main objective is to solve the inherent 
cutting problem with the highest possible space utilization rate. For that, some approaches were developed to minimize 
the fabrics waste in the cutting phase. The approaches complexity increases with the gradual inclusion of some 
considerations inherent to the irregular cutting problem. The approaches performances were compared using some 
benchmark instances and real data given by the company.

its development order, i.e., the FFDH heuristic presented the worst solution, and the IILGFR heuristic the best one. 
When the rotation of pieces was not considered, the exact method generated the best solution. When the rotation of 
pieces was considered, as in the cases of the FFDHR and RFFDHR heuristics, the solution improved, with the 
RFFDHR heuristic presenting the best result. This is because, beyond rotation, it also allows stacking pieces on top 
of each other at the same layer, using the space more efficiently. When the problem was considered non-guillotine, as 
in the case of the LGFR heuristic, an equal roll utilization rate was obtained, although the analysis in section 4 showed 
that, on average, the RFFDHR heuristic presented better results. 
 
Regarding the regular problem, the specialized software generated the best solution. However, considering the normal 
irregularity of the pieces, the IILGFR heuristic generates an even better solution, surpassed only by the company's 
software. In summary, of all the heuristics, the one that presented the closest result to the current solution of the 
company was the IILGFR. However, from a computational point of view, this is the most demanding heuristic, as 
showed by the time required to generate a solution, mentioned in section 4. To address this limitation, a mix between 
the 4th and 5th heuristics can be used, where the 4th is used for larger pieces, and the 5th is used for smaller pieces, 
so that they fill the spaces left by the pieces introduced by the LGFR heuristic. This combination of heuristics presents 
a solution with great efficiency, greatly reducing the computational effort required. 
 
6. Conclusion 
All five heuristics were programmed in Python, taking also into account an exact method solution, coded in CPLEX, 
and a specialized software, to prove the modified heuristics performance. 
Along the successive heuristics, it is notable the increasable level of complexity involved in the problem resolution. 
However, the most complex heuristic may not always correspond to the best solution, since the LGFR heuristic only 
presented a better solution than RFFDHR heuristic on 3/50 cases, presenting a worst solution on 27/50. 
Furthermore, it is also notable that in all cases where the optimal solution of number of rolls was guaranteed to be 
reached, the optimal solution value was low (<10), which can possibly be explained by the accumulated errors. 
By applying the previously presented heuristics to the company’s problem, satisfactory results were obtained, 
highlighting the best solution, given by the IILGFR heuristic, that needs 4,29 m for the roll height, which is very 
close to the actual company solution (4,04 m) that is generated through a highly specialized software. 
For future research, the authors suggest the use of a two-phase heuristic approach, such as in the first phase one of the 
presented heuristics is used to generate an initial solution and in a second phase using an improvement heuristic, that 
make modifications to the initial solution by switching pieces positioning, to obtain progressively better solutions.

Abstract 
Due to the rapid advancement of Industry 4.0, the increasing complexity of industrial applications leads to the 
expanding dimensionality of time series data. To maintain the performance, avoid economic losses, and ensure safety 
during the industrial processes, anomaly detection draws great attention. In view of advantages in dimensionality 
reduction and feature retention, autoencoder (AE) technology is widely applied for anomaly detection monitoring. In 
this work, considering both high dimensionality and dynamic relations between elements in the hidden layer, an 
improved autoencoder with dynamic hidden layer (DHL-AE) is proposed and applied for anomaly detection 
monitoring. Two case studies including Tennessee Eastman process and Wind data are used to show the effectiveness 
of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that compared with classical AE approaches that are most 
commonly used, DHL-AE exhibits the best overall performance in anomaly detection monitoring.

1. Introduction
With the accelerated development of Industry 4.0, considerable technological progress such as artificial intelligence 
and real-time signal processing methods has equipped existing industrial systems with highly sophisticated 
technologies in diverse fields, leading to significant enhancement on the complexity of real-world industrial 
applications, especially chemical industry. The collected data from complicated practical industry processes primarily 
consists of multivariate time series data with high dimensionality. To ensure the operational safety and security of 
complex industrial systems, anomaly detection has been a critical issue for identifying abnormal observations or events 
that deviate from normal patterns, which may cause potential problems in industrial practice (Zhou et al. 2020).

The anomaly detection monitoring results of the aforementioned algorithms is shown in Figure 4. To further analyze 
the comparison of different algorithms based on the results of anomaly detection monitoring, as shown in Table 4, a 
series of metrics are used to express the performance of anomaly detection. Among the aforementioned algorithms, in 
terms of accuracy, precision, FDR, and MAR, the anomaly detection monitoring based on DHL-AE performs best. Its 
recall and F1-score are not the highest values, but not far from them; although the performance of DHL-AE on FAR 
is not the best, it is close to the best values. For methods other than DHL-AE, Sparse AE has the highest F1-score, but 
other metrics do not perform best; 2-Layer Stacked AE has the best recall and FAR values, while its accuracy, 
precision, and MAR has the worst performance. Besides, the recall, F1-score, and FAR of VAE have the worst 
performance. Thus, it is concluded that DHL-AE takes advantages over other AE methods in this case study.

Abstract 
Solar energy is among the renewable energies with the highest growth potential in the world. From this primary 
energy source, one can obtain electrical or thermal energy through different conversion methods, either using 
the photovoltaic panel or the thermal collector, respectively. The photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collector is a 
hybrid solar device that combines, in the same equipment, an electrical energy production module (photovoltaic 
module) with a thermal energy production module (thermal module). However, the PVT does not have the same 
maturity as the photovoltaic panels or the thermal collectors that are independently available on the market. As 
an emerging equipment, it still needs to be further studied and developed, namely in its modelling, among other 
aspects. This work focuses on a numerical investigation of the PVT technology, with the goal of evaluating how 
computational mathematical models predict the operating scenarios of an experimentally studied PVT unit. As 
such, acquired experimental data was analised against simulations of energy and mass balances. The model was 
validated for the same conditions of the experimental tests, therefore determining the degree of agreement with 
the data acquired experimentally. A very good general agreement is observed between the simulated and 
experimental results.

1. Introduction
The energy captured from the sun, solar energy, is one of those considered as renewable, from which electrical and 
thermal energy can be obtained through conversion devices. The hybrid solar collector, called photovoltaic-thermal 
collector (PVT), is an equipment that simultaneously produces heat and electricity by converting solar energy. 
Generically, the structure of the PVT is composed of photovoltaic (PV) and thermal modules together in a single 
device. The cooling of the solar cells by the thermal module fluid increases their efficiency, while at the same time 
there is heat absorption through the same working fluid, which can be used in other processes. The PVT performance 
can be evaluated through experimental and numerical tests. A flat plate PVT without coverage was used in the study, 
supported by an electrical and thermal systems infrastructure, which was properly instrumented in order to obtain 
climatic data (incident solar radiation, ambient temperature and wind speed), the mass flow rate of the thermal fluid, 
temperatures at various points of interest in the equipment, voltage, and current. The present work is based on the 
evaluation of a proposed mathematical model to simulate the behavior of the PVT, and thus be able to optimize its 
performance. This numerical model implemented in a MATLAB-Simulink environment takes into account 
thermal energy balances in each of the PVT components and the equivalent circuit of the solar cell. This model 
not only allows for the calculation of electricity and heat production, but also for understanding the general behavior 
of the collector, under different environmental and operational conditions. A very good overall agreement is 
observed between the simulated and experimental results, noting that the greatest difference between these values 
is around 2.3%. As a general conclusion, it can be said that the proposed model is a reliable tool for studying the 
performance of PVTs.

Based on the analysis carried out, it can be stated that the proposed model constitutes a trustworthy tool to study the 
behaviour of a PVT collector with a similar constitution to the one considered in this work. 
6. Conclusion
The general objective of this work was the validation of a mathematical model developed for the global study of a 
type of PVT collector, namely a PVT without additional glass, in real scale and with a liquid thermal fluid. Inherent 
to the objective, a contribution to a better design of these types of hybrid collectors is pursued. The numerical model, 
with thermal energy balances and solar cell equivalent circuit, was implemented in a MATLAB-Simulink 
environment. The proposed model was validated with an excellent degree of agreement between data acquired 
experimentally, in real conditions, and simulated data, verifying that the highest value of the difference between these 
data was 2.3%, at some moments of the day. Thus, it can be ensured that the model is reliable in its application to the 
study of this type of PVT analysed, and it can even be verified that it can be adapted to other types of PVT.

Abstract 
Delivering chemotherapy at home or in mobile chemotherapy units has become increasingly popular due to its 
convenience and patient-centered approach. However, the high demand, complexity, and stochasticity of the 
Outpatient Chemotherapy Process (OCP) can lead to inefficiencies in implementing these services. To address this 
gap in the literature, this study presents a decision support framework and operational model for optimizing the OCP 
with the inclusion of home-based and mobile chemotherapy services. Data-driven research and relevant literature have 
been integrated to formulate the decision-making process in the proposed decision support framework. A 
mathematical model is developed to determine the patient and nurse assignments to outpatient department, home, or 
mobile chemotherapy services, as well as appointment scheduling. A discrete event simulation model is employed to 
solve the proposed model and determine the performance measures. The optimization experiment included various 
demand scenarios, and the results showed the value of implementing home-based and mobile chemotherapy services 
on patient waiting time and staff overtime under all the considered scenarios compared to a baseline. Finally, 
implementation and modeling strategies have been proposed for scholars and decision-makers to build on this work 
and benefit from its findings.

1. Introduction
Cancer is a major global public health concern, and its incidence is expected to rise by 50% from 2020 to 2040 (Bray 
et al., 2018). Cancer treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these 
methods. However, chemotherapy faces unique operational challenges such as long waiting times  and resource 
overtime (Hadid et al., 2022a). Despite these challenges, more than half of global cancer patients required 
chemotherapy in 2018 (Bray et al., 2018), and Wilson et al. (2019) predict a looming health crisis due to unmet 
chemotherapy demand over the next two decades. 
Compared to the management of patient operations in hospitals, chemotherapy has specific characteristics, including 
a duration of about one up to eight hours and a requirement for pharmacy preparation and coordination between

6. Conclusion 
This study has contributed to the OM literature by conducting a comprehensive review of the related work on HChemo 
and MCU and identifying gaps in the literature. The study has developed a comprehensive decision support framework 
that integrates the HChemo, MCU, and outpatient department processes for optimizing the OCP. Moreover, an 
operational decision model that combines the HChemo, MCU, and outpatient department processes has been modeled 
to determine the patient scheduling and nurse assignment decisions. Real data from a large OCC was collected and 
used to develop and test the model under different demand scenarios. The results confirmed the advantages of 
implementing HChemo and MCU and proposed strategies for proper implementation and modeling.

Abstract 
Products are defined by diverse characteristics that must cater to customer needs for successful marketability and a 
potential innovation. Foresight methods are used for products with a long-term horizon to anticipate future 
requirements and product characteristics at the onset of the engineering process. However, the expected future 
situation and needs can differ from the initial expected environment, necessitating the adaptation of product 
characteristics to meet the changes. Continuous validation of requirements and product characteristics is imperative, 
with changes considered accordingly. 
This paper aims to identify fields of action for engineering methods and design processes in identifying and validating 
future-oriented customer-relevant product characteristics in the product engineering process (PEP), and to derive 
actionable insights and needs for action from this. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify and collate 
factors influencing the area of investigation consisting of three fundamental domains: product development, customer 
involvement and foresight. The interrelationships and coherences were evaluated, and the factors synthesized into an 
Initial Reference Model (IRM). The resultant model revealed five fields of action. Existing potentials and actionable 
steps were identified and described, especially monitoring and change detection of future development and addressing 
and validating of customer needs by integrating customers into the PEP. 
Keywords 
Customer needs, fields of action, foresight, influencing factors and product engineering process (PEP). 
1. Introduction
Products are defined by various characteristics (Albers et al. 2021). These must address the requirements and needs 
of customers so that the product can be successful on the market and thus become an innovation according to 
Schumpeter's (1939) understanding of innovation. The characteristics are defined at the beginning of the product 
engineering process (PEP), and later success depends on the decisions made there (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1993). 
For the development of products with a long-term time horizon, needs must be thought ahead, as they may be very 
different from current needs. For this purpose, methods of foresight are applied (Siebe 2018). However, the expected 
situation in the future can also vary during the PEP compared to the environment expected at the beginning, which is 
why the target characteristics can change significantly by the time the product is launched compared to the 
characteristics defined at the beginning (Albers, Bursac et al. 2018). Changes during the PEP must therefore be 
considered and implemented.  
The requirements and product characteristics must be continuously validated, as this is the only way to ensure “that 
the product can later be successful on the market” (Albers, Behrendt et al. 2016, p. 2).

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 is a new concept that has attracted the interest of many people in different disciplines. However, it remains 
relatively unknown as a concept by many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The 
first objective of this study is therefore to illustrate the facets of the “Industry 4.0” concept from 54 definitions, in 
order to better understand it. The second objective is to conduct qualitative exploratory research to i) identify the 
perceptions of manufacturing SME managers regarding the benefits, challenges, and barriers associated with the 
adoption of Industry 4.0, ii) compare these findings with the results in the scientific literature, and iii) recommend a 
range of levers for use by SMEs to guide them in the successful implementation of Industry 4.0. Fifteen semi-
structured interviews were conducted with manufacturing SMEs. First, our analyses of the 54 definitions made it 
possible to define Industry 4.0 by considering the three facets of “What?” “Why?” and “How?” Next, the results of 
the empirical study revealed the challenges (economic, technical, material, logistical, strategic, relational, and 
planning), benefits (increase in product production and quality, improved working conditions, decentralized and 
digitized production, and increased innovation capacity and data availability), and barriers (financial resources, human 
resources, skills, technology, and strategy). The results particularly highlighted the necessary skills (operational, 
technical, managerial, social, and personal) as an essential prerequisite. To implement this new environment, the 
article recommends a series of levers for SMEs, including, among others, establishing good change management 
through the development of new strategies and business models, and the adoption of a new corporate culture, with 
consistent leadership, planning, and implementation.

Abstract 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) represents business commitments in addressing economic, social, and 
environmental issues related to their activities in order to reduce the negative externalities. CSR is relatively a new 
concept and it is progressing within all type of companies. In theory, CSR is supposed to make business better off by 
allowing them to optimize the use of their resources and create an attractive working environment. However, empirical 
studies have yet to demonstrate the economic, social, and environmental benefits of this approach. This study aims at 
developing a grid of indicators to evaluate the CRS performance of manufacturing SMEs. Our methodology consists 
of a systematic literature review of the indicators proposed in the scientific and gray literature, followed by a series of 
interviews with experts in the field in order to select relevant indicators specific to the manufacturing sector. The 
results presented in this article present a grid of specific CSR indicators for SMEs.

Abstract 
Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are widely used in industrial processes, and finding the most 
appropriate PID parameters plays an important role in optimizing plant operation. However, tuning a large number of 
PIDs is a labor-intensive task that often leaves many control engineers uncertain about how to proceed. To tackle this 
problem, this article provides an automated approach to select and recommend the appropriate set of numerical values 
for P, I, and D. Our approach is an open-loop PID autotuner which is based on a data-driven model that represents the 
physical process and an ensemble of optimization algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we tuned

5. Conclusions 
This paper proposes a systematic PID tuning framework based on a FOPDT model for an industrial open-loop 
process, and its effectiveness of controlling the concentration of black liquor is shown by a case study of an 
evaporator system in Kraft pulp manufacturing. For this energy-intensive industrial application, optimization 
algorithms including CG, Newton-CG, trust-ncg, trust-krylov, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B, Powell, TNC, BOBYQA, 
PSO, and GA can achieve the function of PID tuning. After taking into account the metrics of 𝑅𝑅2, convergence time, 
and closed-loop simulation, it has been established that the Powell and BOBYQA optimization methods are the most 
appropriate choices for optimizing the four PIDs. 
For future research, it would be valuable to conduct a thorough examination of FOPDT as a model identification 
technique in order to assess its benefits and drawbacks in relation to other methods. Furthermore, our proposed 
approach will be validated by testing it on real-world applications. Moreover, there is potential for exploring 
alternative directions, such as utilizing advanced machine-learning and reinforcement-learning techniques to tune 
PID directly in a closed-loop configuration.

Abstract 
This paper aims to explain two drone projects that introduce students to Computer-Aided Design (CAD), design, 
analysis, and simulation through several project-based learning modules. In any Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) 
configuration, the airframe is one of the principal components of the whole structure that can be used as a design topic. 
So, students develop CAD models of airframes and used SolidWorks simulation software, to perform Finite Element 
(FE) analysis studies. The drone frame was simulated and analyzed in various conditions such as drop tests, during 
takeoff, and in-flight maneuvers. FE Analysis showed whether components of the airframe will break, fail, or properly 
work in desired operations.

1. Introduction
Project-based learning is an instructional approach designed to give students the opportunity to develop essential 
knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the real world. 
Students learn to validate whether a drone is operational before it takes flight. The topic of drones is selected since 
they are already widely used in many fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Also, drones 
serve in commercial and military sectors, and many industries rely on them for photography, deliveries, safety 
purposes, information-gathering, agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and many other applications. 
The authors used two drone platforms to introduce students to principles of design and analysis concepts in several 
mini projects. Drone performance depends on many factors, which require design and simulation to evaluate behavior 
and performance under actual conditions. The process starts with the initial design of the airframe of the drone with a 
CAD model and ends with simulation and analysis to determine the stress and deformation of the drone in real-world 
operations. The combinations of 3D printing and FE analysis techniques enable the students to design and analyze the 
drone/UAV that would give the UAV better performance. Stress analysis is critical to understanding fundamental 
structural integrity influencing flight stability and safety. These processes of developing drones with specific 
conditions benefit students that eventually would be useful in designing, developing, and manufacturing mechanical 
parts including drones/UAVs.

Simulation results indicate that the bottom of the drone has higher pressure than the top of the drone which causes 
the drone to fly.  
Conclusion 
Two 3D-printed quadcopters drones were considered for analyzing the performance of drones and the details were 
reported in this report.  Further study would be aimed to perform vibration analysis and test the drone by mounting it 
in a 3D gimballed system for control and navigation study. This project provides a project-based learning opportunity 
to students and helps them develop hands-on skills, thus offering them real-world experience.

Abstract 
Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) is one of the longest-running fuel businesses in the Philippines, serving the needs of 
small and medium-sized enterprises. The import facility operates 24/7, ensuring the completion of loading and 
discharging operations. The gantry operators are involved in lifting the heavy LPG hoses and exerting forcefully with 
their hands to refill the flammable truck. It is necessary to assess them to determine their level of suffering, given the 
hours and days they consumed to accommodate the product's demands. Given these conditions, the paper aims to 
assess the current design of the gantry station to determine the factors that affect the discomfort of the operators. In 
this study, the current working conditions were assessed through interviews and observations with a total of ten (10) 
operators using the Workplace Ergonomic Risk Assessment, WISHA Caution/Hazard Zone Checklist, and Cornell 
Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaires. Based on the results, both WERA and WISHA showed that risk was 
present, requiring further investigation due to the awkward postures. In CMDQ results, the body part of the wrist was 
the highest area of complaint (44.75%), which is the most important to address the pain suffered by the operators. The 
researchers determined that there is no significant relationship between ergonomics assessment and physical 
discomfort using Spearman rank correlations. Furthermore, a proposed action plan was created using the hierarchy of 
administrative (suggestions for administrative programs) and engineering controls of developed equipment that would 
hold the repositioned heavy hose to limit force exertion.

1. Introduction
In loading bays for truck carriers, LPG suction and discharge hoses have been used manually for many years, raising 
the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among workers. Even to this day, most LPG terminals in the Philippines 
handle LPG hoses manually with minimal automation. With little choice but to adhere to the handling practices 
specified by their operators are vulnerable to physical tiredness. These alarming conditions not only raise safety issues 
but also accelerate the deterioration of the operators' health and well-being. Manual Material Handling (MMH) is a 
significant source of worker repetitive, high-effort lifting is a major contributor to low back injuries. Before operators 
began their MMH-related jobs, it was underlined that companies and industries should assess the design of the 
workplace and come up with an ergonomically planned intervention for the operators' health and safety (Rossi et al. 
2013). 
According to Steinberg (2014), the relationship between Manual Handling Operations (MHO) at work and 
musculoskeletal disorders of the hands and forearms is well documented. It is typically defined as manual tasks that 
require manual skills, highly repeated sequences of hand and arm movement, and/or high levels of hand and arm force. 
MHO is characterized by repeated and static muscular and ligamentous tension. The strain placed on the body by these 
activities relies on the intensity of the required effort, the range of motion, as well as the duration and frequency of

5. Conclusion 
Based on the summary of the WISHA Caution/Hazard Zone Checklist, 5 hazards mean if one or more hazard boxes 
are checked, a work-related musculoskeletal disorder hazard exists, and further action is recommended. As a result of 
WERA, there is a serious ergonomic risk in the workplace that requires further investigation and requires change with 
a total mean of 35.5. These findings have significant implications for workplace occupational health and safety, and 
steps should be taken to protect workers from pain and injuries related to their jobs. 
 
After the ergonomics assessment, the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to test its 
relationship with the previous assessment. The researchers used the spearman rank-order correlation coefficient to

measure the strength and direction of association that exist between two variables measured on at least an ordinal 
scale. This test aims to assess the correlational relationship between ergonomic assessment and physical discomfort 
per body part such as the shoulder, wrist, back, neck and leg. Furthermore, the researchers created a proposed action 
plan using the hierarchy controls of administrative and engineering. 
 
Administrative controls should be a change in work procedures such as written safety policies, rules, supervision, and 
training to reduce the severity of exposure to hazardous situations. First, the rotating gantry operators through various 
job tasks so that they do not develop repetitive motion. Second, prohibits operators from working with ionizing 
radiation once they have reached a predetermined level of exposure. Lastly, requiring them in hot environments to 
take a break in cool rest areas and provide fluids for rehydration. 
 
Engineering controls must be implemented in a physical change to the workplace which eliminates the hazard on the 
job task. The researchers developed equipment that would hold the repositioned heavy hose to limit force exertion. 
Given the bad situations, the modified LPG loading arm is a good idea for workers to eliminate excessive leaning or 
reaching. A re-evaluation of the safety and health of the gantry operators in high-risk establishments must be 
conducted regularly, and to be conducted immediately following any changes in the manual operations.

Abstract 
Developing process efficiencies resulting in shorter cycle times (i.e., the elapsed time between starting and completing 
a job) is one mechanism organizations often use to achieve a competitive advantage, higher profits, and/or better 
customer satisfaction. This research examines how a telecommunications company is working to reduce their repair 
process cycle time through an action research project in which researchers work side-by-side with company employees 
to develop and implement practical solutions. Given the specific goal to reduce the cycle time of their existing repair 
processes across multiple locations, the company selected the Lean Six Sigma methodology to guide their process 
improvement efforts. This began with mapping the processes, analyzing measurement systems, and collecting cycle 
time data. In addition to establishing a baseline measurement, these data will be analyzed to identify the sub-process 
steps, product types, repairers, etc. with the longest cycle times. These aspects will then be analyzed further to 
determine the causes of waste in the process. Next, ideas will be developed regarding how to reduce/eliminate the 
causes of waste, these ideas will be evaluated using group decision-making tools, and the most appropriate solutions 
will be implemented. Finally, a control plan will be established to facilitate behavior change of employees working in 
the process and monitor the improved process performance to ensure long-term sustainment of the reduced cycle time.

Abstract 
Lean thinking is an essential concept that has emerged in most organizations and industries. This is due to its proven 
outcomes in improving the process by removing waste and delivering value to the customer. Applying lean has also 
benefited the process by making it more sustainable by reducing the waste that negatively affects the three pillars of 
sustainability (Environment, Economy, and Society). Although lean has been established as a concept to improve the 
manufacturing process, it has extended to cover the maintenance process with reliance on established maintenance 
principles like Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and existing lean methods. This paper aims to study and analyze 
a preventive maintenance (PM) process of a construction company in Qatar and implement lean maintenance methods 
with TPM to improve the process by minimizing lean waste with a focus on improving process sustainability. The 
methodology has been assessed through a real case study from a construction project of the company selected. The 
project equipment preventive maintenance process was analyzed, sustainability indicators were identified, and lean 
maintenance tools were implemented. The results have revealed that the process has been improved, and sustainability 
wastes have been minimized.

1. Introduction
1.1 Lean Thinking Concept
Lean thinking is nowadays an essential concept that has emerged in most organizations and industries. The concept
was first introduced in 1991 by James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, and Daniel Roos in the book The Machine That
Changed the World. Lean introduces five principles: value, value stream, flow, pull, and perfection. Lean thinking
refers to adopting certain principles and techniques to reduce waste in production and manufacturing processes. This
aims to achieve better workflow and added value to the production process by increasing customer satisfaction. Lean,
in the long run, aims to build a system based on management principles that can eliminate all types of waste in the
organization, which can be achieved through continuous planning and improvements at both macro and micro levels
(Womack & Jones 2003).
In 1930, the concept of lean was first established by Toyota in its production process and showed successful results, 
which expanded its reach past the manufacturing process. The Toyota production system represents the pinnacle of 
lean thinking globally and establishes the company as the largest auto manufacturer in terms of sales (Cusumano et 
al. 2021). With time, lean thinking expanded to every sector worldwide and goes beyond manufacturing to include 
logistics, services, distribution, healthcare, government, construction, and maintenance. This is because lean thinking 
has contributed to increased production capacity through concepts that minimize resource usage. Not only does it 
improve customer satisfaction, but resource conservation is becoming increasingly important in working toward 
sustainable development.

Although the magnitudes of emissions from paper usage and fuel consumption are significantly different, they are 
weighed equally since the focus was on the difference in current and future processes instead of the absolute states of 
either. The improvements made to the process are apparent in Table 3, both in terms of the elimination of process 
waste and the carbon footprint of the process. However, it should be noted that the study does not consider other 
practical aspects of the improvements implemented, such as the cost of purchasing and maintaining the CMMS. 
 
4. Conclusion and recommendations 
This paper presented a lean-based methodology for enhancing the sustainability performance of a construction 
company's PM process in Qatar. As can be seen from Table 3, the process and lead times have improved by 80% and 
89%, respectively. These are the indications of lean waste reduction which are desirable for the company as it will 
improve the performance of the PM process, increase the availability, and enhance the utilization of the resources. 
Regarding sustainability improvement, the results show an improvement of 90% in CO2e emissions compared to the 
current process. This is one of the measurable indicators which was accessible for this study. Suppose data on the 
national level, such as road utilization by construction companies' service trucks, is available. In that case, another 
indicator for sustainability could be used to measure the effect of construction equipment services utilization on roads 
which has a social and economic impact on the national level. This is due to its effect in increasing the congestion on 
roads, which affects the mobilization of citizens, concentrates noise pollution, and leads to reduced road capacity, all 
of which impact quality of life. Eventually, there will be a requirement to upgrade the roads and infrastructure due to 
more rapid rates of asphalt deterioration, hence influencing government spending. However, other indirect 
sustainability enhancements in the process are more difficult to quantify, such as fuel consumption reduction on a 
national level due to the implementation of lean thinking in construction company maintenance processes. In 
conclusion, this paper aims to deliver a possible solution for enhancing the sustainability of a PM process for 
construction equipment, which might not show its effect significantly in one company or one project, but creates 
awareness for decisions makers at a national level to consider adopting this technique in policy planning in the 
construction sector.

Abstract 
Understanding the specific timings of ambulance arrivals during different shifts presents unique opportunities for 
emergency department (ED) throughput optimization. This research aims to determine whether there are significant 
differences in ambulance arrivals across various periods (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, and night) and to use 
machine learning to forecast daily emergency medical service (EMS) arrivals. We performed a cohort study of patients 
presenting to an urban, academic ED between January 1, 2021 and April 18, 2022. Data comprised daily patient 
arrivals, demographic information, mode of arrival (either by walk-in or ambulance), chief complaints, and ED 
disposition, focusing exclusively on patients who arrived via ambulance. A Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) 
model was developed to forecast daily EMS arrivals based on different periods. The findings indicate distinct 
ambulance arrival patterns, with higher patient influx during the night shift. The LGBM model achieved moderate to 
high accuracy, particularly during the evening and night periods, with mean absolute percentage errors of 
approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. This study provides insights into ambulance arrival patterns, emphasizing 
the need for specialized care across different periods. These findings can inform the development of decision support 
systems that leverage advanced analytics to optimize resource allocation, enhance preparedness, and improve patient 
outcomes in EDs and health systems.

specialty medical and surgical teams may not be fully staffed. These measures could involve adjusting staffing levels 
during those periods, ensuring the availability of specialized care resources, and optimizing the allocation of critical 
care beds. By proactively addressing these shift-specific challenges, hospitals can mitigate vulnerabilities, enhance 
patient safety, and improve the overall efficiency of emergency care delivery. 
 
The study findings also highlight important characteristics and considerations related to EMS patients in the ED, 
offering insights that can inform improvements in care delivery and resource allocation. Notably, EMS patients 
exhibited high acuity levels, as evidenced by approximately 58% receiving an ESI acuity score of 2 and 13% with an 
ESI score of 1. It is crucial to recognize that the healthcare resource needs for ESI level 1 or 2 patients are dramatically 
greater than those of ESI 3, 4, and 5 patients. Additionally, the study revealed a 32% admission rate among EMS 
patients and an ED length of stay of nearly 13 hours. Like ESI, increased ED and inpatient hospital needs are required 
for admitted versus discharged patients, underscoring the importance of optimizing bed capacity and staffing to 
effectively manage their care requirements. Among the top complaints reported by EMS patients were dyspnea (i.e., 
shortness of breath), abdominal pain, falls, and chest pain, which provide valuable information for targeted 
interventions and preparedness planning. For instance, the identification and awareness that dyspnea accounts for 7% 
of EMS visits can guide the allocation of resources such as non-invasive and invasive positive pressure ventilators 
and the availability of respiratory therapists during surge periods. These findings emphasize the opportunity for 
tailored approaches and proactive measures to optimize outcomes and enhance the overall efficiency of ED operations 
when managing EMS patients. 
 
Our study’s methodology and machine learning approach provide a solid foundation for accurate ambulance arrival 
forecasting. The use of advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the LGBM model, allowed us to leverage 
historical data and incorporate relevant factors such as time of day and day of the week into the forecasting model. 
The LGBM model, known for its fast-training speed and high accuracy in time series forecasting, demonstrated its 
effectiveness in predicting ambulance arrivals for different periods. By incorporating lagged variables and time-related 
features, we accounted for potential temporal dependencies and seasonality, further enhancing the model’s 
performance and robustness. Despite the strengths of our study, there are limitations to consider. First, our analysis 
focused on a single urban, academic ED with a predominantly Black patient population, which may limit the 
generalizability of our findings to other settings and patient populations. Additionally, while our model demonstrated 
moderate to high accuracy, there is still room for improvement, as reflected in the RMSE values. External factors 
beyond the scope of our study, such as major public events or community outbreaks, could influence ambulance 
arrivals and were not accounted for in our model. Furthermore, the retrospective nature of our study limits our ability 
to establish causality and fully capture the complexity of emergency healthcare dynamics.  
 
This study serves as foundational work for future models and opportunities to create forecasting and analytic 
approaches that aid healthcare, specifically ED teams. The accurate forecasting of ambulance arrivals and the effective 
allocation of resources is crucial for improving emergency care delivery. Our study provides insights into the patterns 
and variations of ambulance arrivals, emphasizing the need for specialized care during different periods. These 
findings can inform the development of more sophisticated predictive models and decision support systems that 
leverage advanced analytics to optimize resource allocation, enhance preparedness, and improve patient outcomes in 
EDs and health systems.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This research successfully achieves its objectives of identifying significant differences in ambulance arrivals across 
various periods and employing machine learning to forecast daily EMS arrivals. Our data, collected from an urban, 
academic ED, revealed distinct patterns in ambulance arrivals, with the most significant patient influx occurring during 
the night shift. Furthermore, there were significant differences in arrival times between morning and afternoon, 
morning and evening, morning and night, afternoon and night, and evening and night periods. Interestingly, no 
substantial difference was found between the afternoon and evening periods. The developed LGBM model displayed 
moderate to high accuracy, especially during the evening and night periods, with 21% and 19% MAPE, respectively. 
The unique contribution of this study lies in its comprehensive examination of ambulance arrival patterns and the 
application of machine learning to forecast daily EMS arrivals. It underscores the necessity for specialized care across 
different periods and the potential benefits of predictive models in ED management. In conclusion, understanding and 
predicting ambulance arrival patterns can have significant implications for the efficient management of EDs, which 
may ultimately lead to more effective patient care and improved health outcomes. This research provides a firm

Abstract 
It is important that multidisciplinary community of scientists first investigate all the myriad potential directions that 
quantum machine learning might go to discover what it has to offer. Among these avenues, specified algorithms such 
as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have been applied in different industries for simulation, optimization, 
and prediction purposes. The focus of this paper is to determine the principles associated with the use of VQAs in 
chemistry, machine leaning, and optimization, amongst many other developed algorithms. The key results indicated 
that VQAs can successfully be applied in the above-mentioned fields, with the goal to (1) find ground and excited 
energy states of different molecules in chemistry; (2) maximizing or minimizing an objective function under specified 
constraints in optimization; (3) developing trainable quantum models for accurate predictions of unknown and unseen 
datasets. After statistical analysis, it was discovered that the proportion of publications of VQAs for optimization, 
machine learning, and chemical purposes have been considerably high over the past 6 years. This is justified by the 
sparking attention that parametrized circuits have offered over the recent years. After comparing different size effects, 
it was discovered that the fields of application of VQAs are interconnected, since they presented a small effect size, 
with Cohen’s d value being less than 0.2. From these observations, it can be concluded that the lessons developed 
from one application can serve as direction for others. The metallurgical industry as a field of chemistry can benefit 
from the methods developed in VQAs for optimization, simulation, and development of novel materials.

Abstract
IoT (Internet of Things); which basically refers to the sensor-based connectivity and integrity of multiple technological 
components, devices and objects; has proven applications in manufacturing sector. The concept is recently increasing 
its utilization in service sector as well. This study offers a comprehensive literature review of IoT aplications within 
the scope of service sector. Technological components, main areas of application, utilization goals, related service 
processes, and benefits obtained by the application of IoT are investigated from service sector perspective. Main 
components of IoT systems identified typically include sensors, actuators, network infrastructure, controllers, 
processors, cloud platform, machine learning and AI algorithms to ensure on-line, real-time data collection and 
analysis, leading to powerful business analytics. Transportation and logistics, fleet management, retail, health care, 
financial services, hospitality, and various smart applications for smart buildings, cities and homes appear as the main 
service-related sectors in which IoT philosophy is applied. Findings reveal that service sector utilizes IoT for improved 
operational efficiency, increased productivity, enhanced customer experience, automation and workflow optimization, 
efficient resource management, remote monitoring of maintenance, as well as safety and security enhancement. Hence, 
an overall system improvement is obtained, leading to streamlined customer service delivery and overall cost 
optimization. The study highlighted the importance of IoT components in providing on-line, real-time big data from 
various locations and processes of the service systems. Processing this big data enables service analytics, customer-
centric analysis and data-driven decision-making in all the service processes (including service design, service request 
management, service delivery, service monitoring and reporting, service change management, service feedback and 
improvement, and service training and development). Sensor-based data captured from IoT components feed various 
analytical industrial engineering tools and techniques, such as network modelling approaches, OR techniques, neural 
networks, clustering and segmentation algorithms, and machine learning algorithms. Thus, they are converted to 
insights, factual analysis, advanced reportings, business intelligence and decision-support for all managerial decision 
levels (operational, tactical and managerial). This accurate and dynamic intelligence is useful especially for generating 
advanced customer behaviour analysis, customer segmentation reports and supporting service blueprinting and service 
benchmarking. In conclusion, this study put forward that IoT is applicable and beneficial for not only the 
manufacturing systems, but also the service systems. Adoption of IoT philosophy in service systems of different 
characteristics hava a significant potential for leveraging connectivity and automation, and generating business 
intelligence. Consequently, IoT can transform the operations, and revolutionalize the service-related processes. Since 
applications are relatively recent when compared with the manufacturing systems, comparative IoT implementations 
in various configurations in different service system contexts will continue to be catching attention of further 
researchers.

Abstract 
Predictive maintenance shows significant impact in managing and controlling the utility systems of commercial 
buildings. Here in this paper, the predictive maintenance that is in line with Industry 4.0/ Quality 4.0 is applied. The 
chilled water system is highlighted in this research and the main goal is to reach out the most occurred faults in one 
of the chilled water system, which is cooling tower. An engineering management framework was used through three 
parts, set up, machine learning, and quality control. Having said machine learning, decision tree algorithm is used in 
this research and prediction model showed high prediction accuracy. During an empirical period, the most occurred 
faults were malfunctioning blowdown system, over current, and low water basin level.

Faults, Predictive Maintenance 4.0, Commercial Buildings, Chilled Water System, and Cooling Towers 
1. Introduction and Research Objective
Nowadays, the commercial buildings are filling most of the countries’ grounds. The owners of these buildings are 
obviously spending a lot of efforts in establishing polices and strategies to maintain the same. One of these strategies  
 the operation and maintenance, and this research is addressing the predictive maintenance that in line with Industry 
4.0 and Quality 4.0. Predictive maintenance is defined a managerial way that is optimizing the availability of a  
particular equipment, machine, or system (Kullu and Cinar 2022). Having said a particular system, chilled water 
system is addressed here in this paper. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning  
Engineers (ASHRAE) defined the components of chilled water system and presented the operational way of the said 
system (ASHRAE 2021). They listed the chilled water system onto four different components as shown in Figure

5. Conclusion 
This paper utilized a managerial framework of predictive maintenance 4.0 for chilled water system in commercial 
buildings. A particular chilled water system was chosen for an empirical study. The component is the cooling tower, 
and the goal of the study is to identify the most occurred faults during the associated period. The framework contains 
three parts, which are set up, machine learning, and quality control. The main objective of the set-up part is the data 
collection, and the main objective of the machine learning part is the training the prediction model and testing it, while 
the main objective of the quality control part is to evaluate the prediction model and to make sure the performance is 
acceptable.  
 
Having said machine learning, decision tree algorithm has been used in this paper and one the universities in Riyadh 
city, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has been chosen to implement the empirical study. The prediction accuracy for the 
prediction model is high, which is 99.60 percent, and the prediction model showed an outstanding performance in 
predicting the faults and accordingly in finding the most occurred faults, which are obviously having a negative impact 
on the cooling tower performance. The most occurred faults during the said empirical period were malfunctioning 
blowdown system, over current, and low water basin level. By looking at the literature, it can be seen that no research 
has focused on these faults and the future research agenda can be in this part, so the researchers are advised to do 
further research on these three faults.

Abstract 
In this research paper, the focus is on exploring the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
performance on the performance of mutual funds in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs Data 
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and conducts various hypothesis tests to assess the impact of ESG controversies scores 
on the efficiency of mutual funds. The analysis is conducted on a sample of 17,961 mutual funds from around the 
world, considering data available during the later phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The DEA methodology is used 
to evaluate the performance of mutual funds, and their efficiency scores are determined through the DEA Portfolio 
Efficiency Index (DPEI). The sample is divided into two groups based on the quartiles of ESG scores to investigate 
the influence of ESG controversies scores on mutual fund performance. 
The findings indicate that mutual funds with higher ESG controversies scores outperformed those with lower scores. 
Regardless of the geographic focus of the funds' investments, mutual funds with stronger ESG performance exhibited 
greater financial efficiency. These insights have significant implications for both investors and mutual fund managers. 
Investors, whether retail or institutional, should recognize the potential performance benefits associated with investing 
in socially responsible mutual funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, mutual fund managers are advised 
to avoid including securities with ESG controversies in their portfolios, as doing so can lead to enhanced financial 
efficiency during periods of health, environmental, or market crises. It is important to note that the study's primary 
limitation is the lack of available time-series data for mutual funds throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This study 
stands out as the first to utilize the ESG controversies score as a determinant of mutual funds' financial efficiency 
during the COVID-19 era.

Abstract 
The organ donation and transplantation supply chain - ODTSC is a complex and multi-professional system with 
donors, organs, recipients, and waiting families on the upstream chain side and transplanted patients, and their families, 
on the supply chain downstream side. Health professionals must coordinate and streamline the donation, 
transplantation, and transplanted patients' care, as the 3 main processes in the ODTSC. These processes have been 
improving in several countries, but the global demand for donated organs is nearly 1,3 to 2 million and the 
transplantation capacity is below 150,000 surgeries. The research was motivated by low performance when comparing 
Rio de Janeiro data from 2021 and 2022 to benchmarks and its main objective was to improve practices by analyzing 
the ODTSC and its process and data. Process mining - PM has been evolving from a process and data science topic to 
a useful technology related to production engineering. In health services, the hospital environment, health production 
systems, and society benefit from PM utilization with a new way to increase value. Discover the variants, checking 
the conformance to regulations, analyzing causes, and proposing improvements are PM techniques used to enhance 
performance and reduce the gap between organ demand and supply. The data was used to analyze the process design, 
the data itself, and indicators by applying PM techniques and using a tool. The methodology was based on the design 
research and multiple studies cases methods with a bibliographical review - and no previous work was found, 
demonstrating the novelty of this research; PM tools selection, data preparation; and interviews to identify 
improvements. With the study, it was possible to demonstrate the applicability of PM, and an increase of 15 % in 
organs donated in Rio de Janeiro ODTSC was observed.

Abstract 
The goal of meat alternatives, specifically plant-based and cultured meat, is to provide an environmentally friendly 
food source that has the same cost, taste, and nutritional value as real meat. Currently, the main issue for alternative 
meat sources is the production expenses that contribute to the elevated prices observed by consumers in the market. 
This paper focuses on maintaining a high-quality product in terms of nutritional value while minimizing the production 
expenses associated with raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, and storage for a single serving (142 g) of a 
plant-based beef patty. Raw material constraints were established from a dataset of 20 different plant-based beef patty 
products currently found on the market. Transportation and storage costs and constraints were based on literature 
values with a variable market share. Additionally, the maximum amount of allowable greenhouse gas emissions per 
year was set. Optimal formulations of one plant-based beef patty were determined with a raw material cost of around 
$3.54 per serving and $0.41 per second in distribution and storage costs. The optimal market size was 0.083% of a 
total market consumption of 84.6 million kg of meat alternatives consumed annually in 2021.

1. Introduction
Valued at around $9 trillion, the food industry encompasses about 10% of the world’s gross domestic product (Plunkett 
Research  2023). The four major sectors include farm service, producers, processors, and marketers. During the past 
two centuries, the population across the globe has increased many folds a surge of innovations aimed at enhancing 
food production and distribution (John Hopkins  2023). These efforts resulted in incredibly efficient crop yields and 
food processing plants. An example of a specific innovation was the implementation of industrialized livestock 
production. Through the augmentation of livestock nutrition and medical care, it became feasible to rear animals 
indoors in densely populated settings, with minimal consequences (Food Print  2020).  
While these advancements in technology were favored during the population boom, some activists found revulsion in 
slaughterhouses and the methods used to raise livestock for human consumption (Orzechowski  2020). During this 
time, other movements like environmentalism became popular as well, resulting in an association between the two.

Abstract 
This study aims to reduce the waste surplus (defects) in the production process of agricultural machinery parts in the 
production process of Collar A tractor parts by using the Pareto chart to find significant problems. After that, the root 
cause of the problem is analyzed using a fishbone diagram, and why-why analysis leads to the root cause utilizing 
ECRS principles for correction to help improve processes. Based on current research, defect data from the past three 
months was collected. The main problem is that with a diameter of 40.5 over spec, the average defect proportion is 
53%. Therefore, after ECRS improvement using the R: Rearrange principle, modify the workflow, to eliminate the 
loss that occurs in the production process, resulting in the proportion of waste reduced to only 1 percent.

1. Introduction
The rapid growth of the agricultural machinery market is partly expanding due to new generations working in Bangkok 
migrating to their hometowns because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some people investigate the 
savings earned in Bangkok on agricultural machinery for workforce reduction and efficiency improvement on the 
family property. Moreover, due to the considerable growth of the agricultural machinery parts manufacturing 
industries, inevitable competition occurs in the business contributing more comparative options to the customers. 
Consequently, the entrepreneurs primarily concentrate on manufacturing cost control to improve defect reduction and 
productivity enhancement efficiency.  
The case study was an automotive parts manufacturing company for various automakers, including agricultural parts. 
However, as a recent problem, a waste surplus with a diameter of 40.5 over spec was generated in the manufacturing 
process of Collar A tractor parts. Furthermore, the data collection over the past three months indicated that the average 
monthly defect proportion was 53%. A defect problem, therefore, was analyzed by applying the fishbone diagram, 
and methods for waste reduction were further determined respectively.

5. Conclusion
After the improvement to remove the waste surplus with a diameter of 40.5 over spec in the agricultural machinery 
parts production process in the Collar A tractor manufacturing process, it was found that the waste proportion 
dramatically dropped from 53% to only 1% per month. Consequently, the production processes of the Collar A tractor 
parts remarkably raised production efficiency and decreased defects of the case study company.

Abstract 
As a result of advances in manufacturing techniques and battery longevity, photovoltaic system costs have decreased 
while efficiency of solar panels has increased. Cost reduction in both conventional and renewable energy systems 
depend on effective energy management. To determine how an energy management system for solar systems affects 
cost-reduction, this study introduces one. Starting by researching and analyzing the solar energy systems and find the 
parameters that affecting the high cost of the systems, trying to control the parameter that could be controlled, that 
leads to reduction will be around 30% of use1 saving day as a replacement for 1.5, 46.5% when 1 instead of 2 days, 
and 62.9% of uses 1 instead of 3 days. To further decrease solar energy system costs, this project utilizes weather 
forecasting to predict energy production. It implements energy management techniques to optimize energy usage and 
minimize the need for storage. By optimizing energy consumption, the goal is to enhance solar energy accessibility 
and affordability for consumers.

1. Introduction
To achieve its energy demands, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) heavily relies on nonrenewable energy sources, 
mainly oil. However, there are a number of reasons why the UAE should switch to renewable energy: 
The UAE's hot and dry environment makes it an ideal location for solar energy. The UAE may lessen its dependency 
on fossil fuels by using solar energy, which is a clean, plentiful, and sustainable energy source. Additionally, the price 
of renewable energy has been dropping in recent years, making it more affordable than conventional fossil fuels. And 
during the past ten years, the cost of solar energy in particular has fallen precipitously. Since 2010, the cost of solar 
panels has decreased by more than 85%. Consequently, one of the most economical sources of renewable energy is 
solar electricity. In many regions of the world, the cost of building new utility-scale solar power facilities is now 
comparable to the cost of building new fossil fuel power plants. The region will require more and more energy as a 
result of the cost being highly correlated with the amount that must be generated. So, in order to move the reduction 
ahead and make solar energy suitable for everyone, the cost of PV models must not grow in order to make the system 
smarter by including weather forecast and energy management system. 
1.1 Objectives 
The project is structured into two primary stages, each with distinct objectives. In the first stage, the focus is on 
designing the solar system. This entails conducting cost calculations and identifying the key parameters that will 
influence the implementation of the system. Moving on to the second stage, the aim is to optimize the system's cost

5.4 Proposed Improvements  
The technology may examine a customer's patterns of energy consumption and make recommendations for how to 
use energy more efficiently. Customers will be able to make cost-effective decisions about their energy use thanks to 
this. Customers may also set energy usage targets and monitor their progress towards attaining them with the use of 
individual accounts. For individuals trying to cut their energy costs or their carbon footprint, this function may be 
helpful. Customers may maintain motivation and progress toward their goals by defining targets and keeping an eye 
on their energy use. 
 
The system works by receiving data from sensors and analyzing it to determine the optimal energy usage plan. Based 
on this plan, the system sends commands to the loads, either to switch them on or off or to adjust their usage according 
to the demand. The system can also prioritize loads based on their importance, ensuring that critical loads are always 
supplied with power. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In order to choose the most efficient system, environmental considerations must be considered while installing a smart 
solar energy system. Both the Stand-alone and the Grid-connected systems are effective, but they are reliant on factors 
like location, manufacturing parameters, geographic characteristics, unique parameters, and weather predictions. Grid-
connected systems do not require storage devices, whereas stand-alone systems must; nonetheless, power tariffs might 
affect the cost of system installation. Weather predictions may significantly reduce energy use regardless of the 
solution chosen by increasing user awareness or enabling automation through energy management systems.  
 
To improve energy efficiency, it is crucial to thoroughly consider the system options and pick the one that is most 
appropriate for environmental circumstances. Delaying the control plan is crucial because it enables better energy 
planning and coordination. For instance, the system may postpone the control plan for some loads until a later period 
when the demand is lower if it detects a high energy demand at a particular time of day. As a result, the system won't 
be overworked, and energy will be utilized effectively.

Abstract 
The objective of this data analytics study was to examine the disparities in Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) 
practices within an organization's workforce and analyze the factors that impact EDI in the Greater Vancouver Area 
of British Columbia, Canada. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the concept of EDI, prompting 
organizations to strive for a more diverse and inclusive workplace (Foma, 2014). EDI encompasses the fair and equal 
treatment of all employees, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or physical abilities (Linda, 
2021). While diversity pertains to social categories within a group or workforce, inclusion ensures equitable treatment 
and fosters a safe and welcoming environment for individuals with unique characteristics (Daley, 2022). 
Building upon the prior research conducted by Lancaric et al. (2015), which identified certain factors influencing the 
implementation of diversity, inclusion, and equity in an organization's workforce—such as company size (number of 
employees), legal structure, and the percentage of foreign ownership—this study delved into the factors influencing 
EDI within the organization's workforce. The analysis which was built on surveying 78 Tech companies in Vancouver, 
employed statistical tables, graphs, and charts to assess the gaps, while a regression model was utilized to examine the 
relationships between dependent variables (EDI) and independent variables (e.g., company size, ownership, legal 
structure, and industry). The findings revealed that the EDI gap in the organization's workforce primarily lies in 
training, adherence to documented EDI policies, organizational culture, and the recruitment process. Notably, the 
study indicates that the organization's ownership structure (specifically majority owners) and legal form significantly 
impact the EDI practices within the workforce.

Abstract 
There are many complex multi-component systems with partial observations in production facilities. When an 
unexpected failure occurs, it can cause serious profit losses. For this reason, it holds significant importance to 
determine and implement efficient maintenance strategies. Nevertheless, the interactions and interdependencies 
among components pose challenges in obtaining effective maintenance policies for these systems. Therefore, it is 
crucial to accurately model the relationships in complex systems. Bayesian networks (BNs) hold the advantage of 
representing and modelling such complex relations by using conditional probabilities. Moreover, dynamic Bayesian 
networks (DBNs) extend the BNs to be applied in dynamic environments by adding a temporal dimension to the 
network. 
In this study, we tackle the maintenance problem of the CNC machines in a pump production facility. The operation 
of the CNC machines is automatically controlled with the help of computer support and this enables mass production 
possible. CNC machines are complex systems having many interacting and partially observable components. We 
analyze the different types of CNC machines by realizing many site visits to the production facility. Out of them, we 
first consider the CNC Vertical Machining Centre (CNC-VMC), which is the most frequently used one in the facility, 
as a complete system. Then, we divide the CNC-VMC system into subsystems by using the HAZOP methodology 
and asking critical questions to the experts working in the facility. Among these subsystems, the axis system, which 
is the most critical one for the operation of the system, is chosen for modelling the maintenance problem in this study. 
We represent and model the interactions, dependencies and depreciations of the system using DBNs. The maintenance 
of the axis system is simulated with the help of the DBN model under corrective maintenance strategy. We verify and 
validate the model by replicating it many times and compare the policy outputs with the real-life data. The results 
justify the validation of the DBN model under corrective maintenance.

Abstract 
With the current rapid technological evolution, most countries are facing a major challenge to keep up with the pace. 
In this context, the industrial sector, which is an essential pillar of any country, also needs to adapt and accelerate the 
process of digitization of Industry 4.0 to ensure continuous and resilient production in the face of pandemics such as 
Covid-19. However, the Covid-19 crisis has had a significant impact on the industrial sector, with the temporary 
closure of many factories to protect the health of workers, leading to a severe economic crisis. 
This document focuses on the importance of the rapid adaptation of the industry to digitization, particularly Industry 
4.0, to maintain production in the face of pandemics such as Covid-19. The article examines the advantages and 
disadvantages of Industry 4.0, as well as relevant technologies. It also presents research on the impact of the Covid-
19 crisis on industrial businesses and the use of Industry 4.0 to manage this crisis. An investigation was carried out on 
45 Moroccan companies from different regions, and the results showed that more than 50% of these companies 
maintained or increased their turnover thanks to the implementation of Industry 4.0. 
Keywords 
Covid-19, Industry 4.0, industrial revolution, digitalization. 
1. Introduction
Digitization is a phenomenon that is spreading rapidly around the world, generating increased competition between 
companies. To remain competitive, they must adapt by using advanced Industry 4.0 technologies. Technologies such 
as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and additive manufacturing are being implemented to improve 
productivity, production customization and information management. 
However, the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted businesses around the world, with significant economic impact. To 
cope with this situation, many companies have sought alternative solutions to survive, including relying on the digital 
technologies of Industry 4.0. In Morocco, companies have also adopted this strategy to resist the pandemic. 
The application of digital technologies allowed companies to adapt quickly to the new situation and continue to operate 
despite the restrictions imposed. Remote communication tools allowed teams to work together despite physical 
distance, while document management tools enabled instant access to information and real-time collaboration. Remote 
support tools were also used to manage computers and machines remotely, allowing companies to maintain 
production. 
2. Evolution of Industry 4.0
The industry has undergone a major revolution; it has gone from the first production system that is based on 
agriculture essentially (Industry 1.0) to an intelligent industrial system (Industry 4.0).

(37.15%), cloud computing (32.85%), advanced simulation (15.7%) and additive manufacturing (2.85%). Companies 
using a combination of these technologies can benefit from greater efficiency in their Industry 4.0 implementation. 
 
The survey also looked at the potential impact of the implementation of Industry 4.0 on the organization of work 
within the companies surveyed. The results show that more than half of the companies that have partially or fully 
implemented the digital technologies of Industry 4.0 (i.e. 58.5%) expect their work organization to be impacted. 
 
Of these companies, 18.5% expect some jobs to disappear in the coming years. This can be explained by the fact that 
Industry 4.0 often involves the automation of certain tasks, which may lead to a reduction in the workforce. However, 
it is important to note that 30% of the companies surveyed believe that nothing will change in their work organization 
by applying the digital technologies of Industry 4.0. 
 
These results show that while companies expect changes in their work organization by implementing Industry 4.0, 
they are not necessarily pessimistic about the future of their workforce. 
Implementing Industry 4.0 has different challenges depending on whether companies have already applied digital 
technologies or not. For companies that have not yet applied digital technologies, the major challenges are related to 
manpower. Indeed, 50% of companies consider the lack of skilled labor as the main cause, while the remaining 
companies consider resistance to change among employees as the main obstacle. This may be due to a fear of losing 
their job or a reluctance to learn new skills. 
 
In contrast, for companies that have already implemented digital technologies, the challenges are grouped into four 
main categories. First, human challenges, which include workforce qualification, resistance to change, the need to 
support employees in the transition, etc. Second, financial challenges, which may be related to funding needs, 
excessive cost, uncertain return on Industry 4.0 investment, etc. Technical challenges are also important, especially 
with regard to the implementation of the latest technologies. Finally, security is also a major challenge for companies 
adopting Industry 4.0, especially in terms of cyber security. 
 
These results indicate that for half of the companies that have applied Industry 4.0 digital technologies, their revenue 
has been stable or increased in the first six months of 2020, compared to the same period in previous years. This 
suggests that the implementation of these technologies can have a positive impact on companies' financial results. 
However, for 18.5% of companies, revenue decreased, highlighting that the implementation of Industry 4.0 does not 
necessarily guarantee positive financial results for all companies. It is important to note that the turnover of the 
remaining companies was not revealed, so it is not possible to draw any conclusions about their financial situation. 
 
Interestingly, despite the Covid-19 global health crisis, most companies that implemented Industry 4.0 were able to 
maintain their business moderately or without major impact. In fact, 78.5% of companies reported a moderate or no 
impact on their business. This is largely due to the stability of their activities (60% of companies) or a partial shutdown 
(37.2%). 
 
Companies have successfully adapted to the situation by using digital tools such as remote team communication tools, 
telecommuting tools for meetings, remote support tools for telecommuting, and document management tools with 
anytime access. For example, 55.5% of companies used remote team communication tools and 78.5% used 
telecommuting tools for meetings. 
 
These tools allowed employees to work remotely and securely and to continue their activity despite the restrictions 
imposed by the health crisis. Importantly, Industry 4.0 has played a crucial role in companies' ability to adapt to the 
situation by using innovative digital technologies.

9. Conclusion  
Indeed, the application of Industry 4.0 digital technologies has enabled companies to better withstand the Covid-19 
crisis. By using the different pillars of Industry 4.0, companies have been able to adopt new, more flexible and efficient 
ways of working, allowing them to maintain their production and activity despite health and economic constraints. 
 
The survey of Moroccan companies showed that the use of Industry 4.0 technologies was particularly helpful during 
the lockdown period. Remote communication tools, such as chat and video conferencing, allowed employees to work 
remotely and stay in touch with colleagues and customers. Remote support tools also helped keep machines and 
computers running smoothly, even without on-site staff. 
 
In addition, analysis of the survey results shows that the implementation of Industry 4.0 has also had a positive impact 
on company productivity and innovation. The new technologies have helped to optimize production processes and 
reduce costs, while improving product quality and enabling new business models. 
 
Finally, the application of digital technologies of Industry 4.0 is a crucial issue for companies, especially in times of 
crisis. It allows them to better withstand economic and health shocks by offering them innovative and efficient 
solutions to maintain their activity and improve their competitiveness, something that validates our main hypothesis.

Evaluation of Plastic Waste Management Options Using  
Life Cycle Assessment Approach  
for a Sustainable Future 
Abdulmajeed ALMADHI, 
Prince Sultan University, 
221121093@psu.edu.sa 
Abstract: 
Plastic's discovery resulted in a profound shift in human lives, and it is now used in a wide range 
of critical applications. Despite its importance, the world is struggling to control plastic waste and 
prevent it from infiltrating the natural environment. This paper intends to evaluate the 
environmental burdens of various plastic waste management scenarios using life cycle assessment 
(LCA). This paper evaluated five options: landfill, incineration, mechanical recycling, pyrolysis, 
and combined mechanical recycling and pyrolysis. The CML-IA Baseline approach is employed 
in this study for all scenarios, with OpenLCA software. The data for this paper came from the 
Ecoinvent 3.9.1 database and public reports. The last scenario, which is combined mechanical 
recycling and pyrolysis was found to have the lowest environmental burdens, according to the 
LCA results. Furthermore, the combined scenario may absorb a greater range of plastic waste, 
improving the whole waste management system to transition to a circular economy. Therefore, it 
is advised to build a portfolio of plastic waste handling techniques that provide high quality 
recovered products to meet numerous consumer requirements. Since it was established in this 
study that renewable energy has a notable favorable environmental impact across all impact 
categories, using renewable energy for electricity generation was recommended.

Abstract 
Social Network Analysis (SNA) has garnered significant attention within Supply Chain Management (SCM) and 
Operations Management. Nevertheless, despite the extensive body of research on SNA, the existing literature 
emphasizes the importance of exploring new indicators and novel application areas. This study aims to address this 
gap by investigating the latest recent trends in applying SNA within the domain of SCM. The present study comprises 
two main goals: first, to find recent literature addressing the application of SNA in the field of SCM; and second, to 
scrutinize the utilization of new and specific metrics in the field of SCM. A comprehensive review of recent literature 
in this domain is conducted to achieve these goals. The review results reveal a consistently relevant number of 
publications that apply SNA to SCM. Moreover, in addition to the traditionally recognized sectors like manufacturing, 
automotive industry, and construction, new application domains are emerging, specifically in fashion and 
humanitarian relief. Across the reviewed studies, transverse SNA metrics are applied. The metrics identified in the 
review are network-related and node-related. In addition to new applications and metric calculations, adopting SNA 
in the SCM field has given rise to new concepts. One such concept is semi-directedness, which supports the analysis 
of the entire network while providing a new set of semi-directed metrics. This study contributes to the literature by 
identifying new applications and metrics considered preferable for evaluating supply chain performance, such as semi-
directness.

Abstract 
In Peru, the textile industry is the third activity with the highest contribution to manufacturing GDP. However, most 
companies suffer from a lack of production planning, organizational culture, and training. This research has focused 
on the development of an improvement model proposal, combining Lean Manufacturing and Systematic Layout 
Planning tools to solve the main problems that arise in this type of company. Which is evaluated through a simulation 
in the Software Arena for its validation, where a decrease of 39.76% of the transfer time was obtained, a reduction of 
the cycle time by 15.11% and an increase of 17.99% of productivity.

1. Introduction
Globally, the textile sector represents a significant part of the world's gross domestic product (GDP). In 2017, the 
indicator for the textile sector worldwide was 3.4% (Flores-Meza et al. 2020). Between 2016 and 2019, out of every 
10 garments sold, less than one unit was acquired from the national producer in the I Semester 2020 (Institute of 
Economic and Social Studies 2021). The study clearly shows that the entrepreneur has to understand that one of the 
most important challenges he faces is to remain competitive in the market (Vargas-Hernández et al. 2018). Since this 
has a strong impact on the economic growth of a country, as is the case of Peru. For this South American country, the 
textile industry is the third activity with the highest contribution to manufacturing GDP (6.4% share in 2019). 
However, according to statistical studies by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (2021) they revealed that the textile 
sector only reached 51.17% of its capacity on average for the year 2020. 
This mostly affected small and medium-sized companies, where the lack of productive planning, organizational 
culture and training compromised service levels. In addition, several studies indicate that this problem is due to 
unproductive times and defects (Durand-Sotelo et al. 2020). These problems mainly generate excessive movement 
and transport, a low level of productivity and delays in orders (Ruiz et al. 2019). These problems have also been 
identified in other investigations in different countries. For example, in a textile company in Colombia, a percentage 
of unproductive times of 40% was identified, due to the lack of standardized procedures for operations prior to the 
assembly of each production order, which represents non-compliance with schedules, delays in the deliveries of the 
order orders and low productivity in the plant (Martínez Sánchez et al. 2014). Another investigation in a textile 
company in Peru, the company had a high cycle time of 33.64 due to waste from the processes. This prevented it from 
meeting the demand for the product, meeting only 34% of the total (Ruiz et al. 2019). The studies mentioned above

6. Conclusion 
As it could be observed in the results, the proposed model serves to solve the productivity problem on the elaboration 
of a diver in a textile MSE and is available to solve other similar cases in organizations with similar characteristics. 
In the analyzed company, 2 major causes that led to low productivity were detected: presence of unproductive times, 
and the number of defectives, the improvement proposal worked on managed to increase the productivity of the 
company by 17.99%. The application of the SLP methodology managed to reduce travel times by 39.76%, from 2.32% 
to 1.65% of cycle time. The application of standardized work achieved a decrease in defectives by 58.62%, from 
16.11% to 6.67% with respect to the total quantity produced. Finally, this model allowed a 58.62% reduction in 
reprocessing time for defective products. For future research, it is recommended to focus on other processes or areas, 
such as supply chain management, looking for opportunities for improvement and achieving better benefits for the 
company.

Abstract 
In this paper, the researcher observed the delivery performance of a local ""delivery service business."" Upon 
observation, it shows that considerable numbers of late delivery are the central problem, and the study addresses it by 
determining the leading root cause that highly contributes to the problem. The researchers manually recorded raw data 
used in this study upon observing the company's daily operation in the set time frame. Also, the administration was 
interviewed and customer feedback was gathered. In analyzing the ultimate root cause of late delivery, different root 
cause analysis tools were used in this study: a fishbone diagram for the general root causes, a five whys analysis, and 
a scatterplot diagram for determining the primary root cause. Results from the RCA tools concluded that delays caused 
by the store are the root cause that highly contributes to the late delivery of the business. For the recommendation, the 
study designed a new delivery process to minimize the number of delays caused by stores and to increase the success 
rate in meeting the customers' expected arrival time. This study used a mixture of quantitative and qualitative design.

1. Introduction
The start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Philippines brought a huge panic to the Filipinos, especially when the whole 
island of Luzon was put on lockdown. As the people had been staying home for quarantine, boredom hit most of them, 
leading to different new ideas and unique concepts of doing the usual activities during the period. One of the most 
popular ideas was starting a food delivery service business that everyone wanted because it would allow them to get 
the food they wanted without leaving their houses. Although this concept existed even before the pandemic, the 
quarantine protocols and the fear of people going outside braced this business.  
The delivery service business was one of the businesses that became popular during the pandemic in the Philippines 
(Arreaola, 2020). This study examines a delivery service business that started to operate in March 2020 in Plaridel, 
Bulacan, with a small growing group of friends and eventually expanded with the support of local stores. It expanded 
its scope and now caters to more municipalities and cities in Bulacan. It now offers services such as PasaBuy Food, 
PasaBuy Package Delivery, PasaBuy Pa-ANGKAS, and PasaBuy Paybills.  
The food delivery service starts when a customer contacts them through the business's Facebook page. The page 
automatically sends the list of services they offer whenever a customer visits the chat box. These options let the 
customer choose what services they want. After choosing the Food Delivery Service, the system sends an order request 
format containing the name of the stores, list of orders, name of the order, address, nearest landmark, contact number,

It is an important step for the business to know their customer's satisfaction. However, it is not forced on the side of 
the customer to answer the form.

6. Conclusion 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders have been implemented in different 
countries, causing the most severe disruption to the global economy. People need to innovate and create ways to sell 
their products to make their business alive, and, in some countries, restaurants can operate under takeaway/delivery 
sales (Gossling et al.,2020). Faced with this dire situation, characterized restaurants were forced to increase, diversify, 
or adapt new sales channels such as food delivery apps (FDAs). (Gossling et al.,2020). In this manner, customers have 
the option to purchase food in the comfort of their homes and save more time and effort since there is no requirement 
to stand in long queues to pay and risk their health in physical stores. They can buy food through food delivery 
applications and pay using online credit and debit cards or cash upon delivery. The delivery time in a food delivery 
business is a crucial factor since it is one of the strong predictors of customer satisfaction in buying foods online, as 
well as the service quality, price, and condition of food delivered (Saad, A. 2020). Food delivery businesses must aim 
to provide convenience, accessibility, and exceptional service to promote a good company image that will surely 
attract more customers in the future. 
 
Through the observation of their daily operation as well as interviews on the management of the business itself, overall 
root causes are compiled and listed using a fishbone diagram. It shows that management, natural events, people (rider 
and customer), and process technology are the four general root causes of late deliveries of the business. To further 
highlight the ultimate root cause of late deliveries, different root cause analysis tools are used: the five why analysis 
and scatterplot diagram. The results obtained in the five why analysis concluded that the main root cause of late 
deliveries is the delays caused by store factors and that the management of the business should have countermeasures 
for it. It also results in another tool used in this study which is the scatterplot diagram, that delays caused by stores 
have a more linear relationship and a highly correlated factor with late deliveries. 
 
Focusing on the delay caused by the store as the main root cause of the late deliveries as concluded in the root cause 
analysis performed, researchers proposed several recommendations to particularly solve store delay. The 
recommendation proposed by the researchers is designing a new delivery system flow to particularly reduce the late 
delivery caused by store factors. This new delivery system proposed includes riders calling the store first to place an 
order through the store's hotline number, and delivery updates wherein adding communication between riders and 
customers to update them if there would be delays or other unexpected situations. Through these delivery updates, 
wherein customers will be updated to unexpected delays caused by the store, a tentative 30 minutes are added to the 
customer's expected time of arrival of their orders, wherein it is the tentative maximum delay of their order. This store 
delay includes the preparation of orders, long queue lines, etc. A feedback form is also proposed to be answered by 
customers at the end of the service. Getting customer feedback can further improve the service provided by the 
business. An additional recommendation is having an application on the smartphone to have a clear record of the

management and also clear communication between rider and customer, as it has many features like timely updates 
of their order that will further satisfy customers. But it will only be materialized if the business acquires a programmer 
to create the app and more importantly, the business has a budget allocated for it.

Abstract 
For over three decades, Total Quality Management (TQM) has been widely acknowledged as a crucial strategy for 
organizations. The present article aims to delineate how Albanian Companies utilize Quality Management Practices. 
To this end, a survey comprising 800 respondents was conducted to investigate the current status of Quality 
Management Practices utilization in Albania The analysis of QM practices unveiled that companies tend to favor the 
usage and accord greater importance to soft practices such as teamwork and customer focus. Contrarily, companies 
tend to attach less significance to and abstain from using hard practices such as Analysis of Variance and Six Sigma. 
According to the respondents, Albanian companies are positioned at a mid-level stage of QM maturity level, with 
more than 50% attesting that their companies are at the ""inspection"" age and less than 30% stating that their companies 
have accomplished strategic quality management. This unsatisfactory level of QM maturity may imply that Albanian 
companies prioritize quality management with more focus on inspection and control rather than quality assurance and 
strategic management. As such, ""improvement"" in this context may signify bringing the operation back to the standard 
rather than improving the standard. Ultimately, future research endeavors stemming from these findings could explore 
how QM practices could be effectively employed to help companies achieve higher QM maturity levels and strategic 
quality management.

Introduction  
In today's contemporary world, the variables that impact the actions of corporations on a global scale are changing at 
an increasingly rapid pace. This trend is exemplified by the current scenario, where business acquisitions, mergers, 
and dissolutions are commonplace. The driving force behind these actions is the desire of each organization to exceed 
customer expectations in terms of quality, cost, delivery, and service, ultimately rendering their existing products 
obsolete through the introduction of new ones. Consequently, we frequently observe organizations that fail to meet 
these requirements and consequently struggle to market their products and services, ultimately leading to the 
divestiture of their businesses. 
In contemporary times, developing countries are progressively becoming a state without borders. It is evident that 
products are designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold in yet another. Hence, the main predicament

We have discovered that companies with a strong tradition in quality programs are the ones most likely to implement 
the Six Sigma Program. Moreover, it has been observed that companies that invest more in quality tend to perform 
better both in terms of quality and financial indicators. The primary reasons for the failure of Quality Management 
(QM) programs have been attributed to weak support from top management and a lack of financial resources. 
This qualitative study in Albanian companies found also that soft elements such as bureaucracy, communication, and 
leadership were the main barriers to the successful implementation of QM practices. This article provides further 
insights by addressing several questions, such as the quality concept adopted by Albanian companies, the most 
commonly used principles, practices, techniques, and tools, the primary obstacles to implementation, the level of 
maturity and evolution of QM in Albanian companies, and the practical implications of this research for the Albanian 
industry. 
 
5. Results and Discussion  
The concept of quality is a crucial aspect for companies to consider. The research conducted found that a significant 
percentage of respondents strongly agree or agree that Albanian companies understand quality as a manufacturing-
based and value-based approach. However, there is a lack of agreement when it comes to transcendental and product-
based approaches. Furthermore, there is a minimal percentage of respondents who agree that their companies have a 
user-based approach. The respondents also gave points for each quality dimension, and according to them, 
performance is the most important dimension of quality for Albanian companies, followed by conformance, reliability, 
and perceived quality. On the other hand, durability, serviceability, features, and aesthetics are under average. 
The utilization of quality management (QM) principles, practices, techniques, and tools is also an essential aspect to 
consider. The respondents were asked to classify 20 quality practices in terms of utilization and importance on a 
grading scale. The results showed that all practices were classified as being important, with some practices being more 
utilized than others. The most cited barriers faced by the respondents in order to implement QM programs and quality 
practices are resistance to change and lack of perception about shared responsibility among all organization’s areas. 
It is important to note that many of the barriers are related to soft aspects such as human factors and management. 
When it comes to the degree of evolution and maturity level of Albanian companies, most of the respondents believe 
that their companies are in the initial and intermediate stages of maturity level. However, it is crucial to understand 
the trends and if the companies are rising up through the maturity level. Other questions were asked in order to 
diagnose the situation of companies in relation to the quality management eras. While some respondents believe that 
their companies are still in the inspection era, the majority believe that their companies should be in the strategic 
management era of quality evolution. 
 
6. Conclusion  
According to the findings of this research, Albanian companies exhibit an intermediate level of quality maturity. Such 
a level implies that companies are more inclined towards quality management through inspection and control 
activities. Thus, addressing improvement in this area could mean bringing operations back to a standard rather than 
enhancing the standard. Although the study reveals that many quality principles and techniques are employed by these 
companies, advanced improvement techniques such as QFD, and Six Sigma are still underutilized and deemed of less 
significance. Despite Quality Management being a well-established and widespread concept that has undergone 
constant development in recent decades, many organizations are yet to realize its strategic benefits. Consequently, 
Albanian companies have a substantial opportunity to enhance their quality and productivity levels. Further research 
could explore how QM practices can be effectively implemented to help companies achieve higher Quality 
Management maturity levels and strategic quality management.

4. Conclusions 
AM has emerged as a transformative and disruptive technology, revolutionizing traditional manufacturing approaches 
by enabling agility and efficiency in response to disruptions and dynamic demands. This study presents a 
comprehensive bibliometric and narrative review analysis of the literature on additive manufacturing and its impact 
on supply chain resilience. 
 
The analysis reveals a substantial growth in publications on additive manufacturing and supply chain resilience, 
particularly in the post-Covid-19 era. Integrating digital supply chain concepts with AM technology has gained 
significant attention to enhance supply chain networks' resilience. Additionally, disruptions arising from geopolitical 
instabilities and natural disasters have motivated researchers and practitioners to explore the potential of AM 
technology in mitigating the ripple effects of such disruptions. 
 
Nevertheless, the implementation of AM technology in manufacturing organizations faces numerous technological, 
legal, economic, and social barriers. These barriers vary across industries, posing unique challenges for adopting AM 
technology. Furthermore, the integration of AM with other digital supply chain enablers, such as those associated with 
Industry 4.0, is still in its early stages. This presents a promising opportunity for further research to explore the 
integration of AM with digital supply chain technologies, aiming to enhance supply chain resilience in organizations. 
In conclusion, this review highlights the transformative potential of AM technology in bolstering supply chain 
resilience. While acknowledging the existing barriers, it underscores the need for continued research in integrating 
AM with other digital supply chain enablers to unlock the full benefits of enhanced supply chain resilience for 
organizations.

Abstract 
Integrating Total Quality Management (TQM) and Industry 4.0 technologies has gained attention as a promising 
approach for firms seeking to improve their operational efficiency and sustainability performance. This research 
conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine the integration of TQM and Industry 4.0 technologies to 
achieve sustainability through the lens of dynamic capabilities. The literature analysis identified six main drivers and 
barriers: organizational culture, leadership commitment, technology infrastructure, employee training, data 
management, and cybersecurity. The findings revealed that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies has a positive 
impact on the implementation of TQM and sustainability performance in manufacturing organizations. The results 
also indicate that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and features is influenced by drivers such as strategic 
objectives and external pressures. In contrast, barriers such as limited resources and technology compatibility hinder 
the adoption process. The research presents a theoretical proposition emphasising adopting a dynamic capability view 
in TQM and Industry 4.0 integration for sustainable performance. Furthermore, the proposed theoretical framework 
highlights that integrating TQM and Industry 4.0 technologies positively affects sustainability performance, 
particularly in the economic and environmental dimensions. Recommendations for organizations seeking to integrate 
TQM and Industry 4.0 technologies include prioritizing organizational culture and leadership commitment, providing 
employee training, effective data management, and robust cybersecurity measures. Overall, this research contributes 
to understanding how TQM and Industry 4.0 integration can enhance sustainability performance through the lens of 
dynamic capabilities.

Abstract 
As the prevalence of kidney disease continues to rise, the increasing demand for dialysis services must be addressed 
to ensure efficient and patient-centric care. Currently, hemodialysis poses significant challenges for patients, and it is 
clear that there is a need to improve the scheduling process to enhance their overall experience. This paper proposes 
an optimization strategy that can be implemented to improve nurse and dialysis unit scheduling for the benefit of 
patients. A case study from a unit on an island in Tunisia (North Africa) is considered to illustrate that optimizing 
nurse and dialysis unit scheduling can better accommodate the growing number of patients requiring hemodialysis 
and provide timely and accessible care. This includes strategically managing resources, ensuring appropriate staffing 
levels, and implementing efficient scheduling systems that prioritize patient needs. This paper recognizes the 
importance of optimizing appointment scheduling for patients in the dialysis unit, while also considering the 
constraints on nurses and equipment availability. By minimizing patient wait times, implementing a safety net 
measure, and exploring innovative solutions, it is shown that the quality, reliability, and efficiency of care provided 
in the hemodialysis setting is improved. This research contributes to the broader goal of improving patient experiences, 
addressing healthcare provider challenges, and optimizing resource utilization in dialysis units.

1. Introduction
The kidneys play a vital role in eliminating waste products, maintaining fluid balance, and regulating electrolytes in 
the human body. They receive about 25% of the heart's total blood output and filter approximately 187 liters of liquid 
daily. Only 1% of the initial filtrate ends up as waste products in the urine, while the remaining 99% is reabsorbed 
into the bloodstream to prevent dehydration (Sherwood  1993). Blood initially flows into the kidney through the renal 
artery, which eventually branches off into various blood vessels until it reaches the nephron, the functional unit of the 
kidney (Figure 1). The nephron contains the glomerulus, which oversees the filtration of the blood, as well as the 
tubule, which is the site of secretion and reabsorption of important amino acids, vitamins, and solutes. Waste products 
like urea and creatinine, derived from food and tissue breakdown, are concentrated in urine, whereas, active and 
passive transport mechanisms will reabsorb the necessary nutrients back into the blood. The kidneys also ensure the 
stability of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte levels by adjusting water and electrolyte excretion based on 
intake. Additionally, the kidneys serve as an endocrine organ, producing hormones like erythropoietin for red blood 
cell production and activating vitamin D for proper bone health. Moreover, they act as the primary route for 
eliminating foreign substances, including drugs, food additives, pesticides, and other components from the body. 
Kidney failure results in the accumulation of waste products, disruption of fluid and water balance, and dysfunction 
of the kidney's endocrine functions. This leads to impairment in multiple organ systems, resulting in a toxic state 
called uremia, which, if left untreated, can be fatal. Kidney failure is a chronic condition that requires intensive and

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, an optimization strategy was proposed to enhance nurse and dialysis unit scheduling, resulting in 
improved care for patients. This study demonstrates that optimizing nurse and dialysis unit scheduling can successfully 
accommodate the increasing number of patients in need of hemodialysis while ensuring timely and accessible care. 
An integer programming model was prepared for this purpose. The objective function of the model was to minimize 
dialysis times, and this was achieved by scheduling all patients three times per week, as per the requirement, as well 
as ensuring that the patients are given enough time to bleed if necessary while considering cleaning, preparation, and 
shift times. Further development of this study could include collecting data based on patient availability and 
performing the optimization based on this availability. During our optimization, the aim was to minimize the number 
of machines used, and the minimum number of machines required to schedule 36 patients for three sessions in a week 
was 9. Three machines are kept on standby in case of breakdowns, and maintenance is kept out of the summer months, 
so we are not losing a machine while we have more patients. During the other months of the year, there are only 27 
patients, meaning, since the current unit capacity was shown to accommodate the busy summer months, it can 
therefore handle the less busy months throughout the year. The approach presented in this paper involves strategic 
resource management, maintaining appropriate staffing levels, and implementing efficient scheduling systems that 
prioritize patient needs. The mathematical programming model presented in this paper has been designed as a 
deterministic problem, disregarding uncertainties at this stage. Future work will consider the incorporation of various 
uncertainties, such as uncertainties related to patient no-shows, late arrivals, and unpredictable durations for dialysis 
treatments.

Abstract 
Today, with the ever-increasing technology, the environments in which companies are in competition have also 
increased and most companies have started to use machines that are more technological and require less manpower. 
While this may seem like an advantage in many respects, the complexity of the machinery used complicates many 
things. At the beginning of these difficulties is the determination of the maintenance policies of the machines. The 
occurrence of an unexpected malfunction in such systems causes serious problems such as product delays, lost sales 
and customer dissatisfactions. On the other hand, over-maintenance to reduce unexpected downtime can lead to 
unnecessary maintenance costs. In order to achieve the balance, it is of great importance to reduce reactive 
maintenance by keeping the number of proactive maintenance at the optimum level. In this study, a threshold based 
proactive maintenance policy is presented for multi-component systems where there exist stochastic and structural 
dependencies among the components. The proposed strategy is a predictive one that determines the proactive 
maintenance times of the system by considering the current system reliability. A tabu procedure is also proposed 
within the strategy to prevent the same component from being repeatedly selected for maintenance when frequent 
proactive maintenance is planned. Dynamic Bayesian networks, which are successful in expressing the dependencies 
and time based relations between components, is used to model the system and to compute the required inferences. 
As a case study, the policy is simulated on a regenerative air heater system which is used in thermal power plants and 
compared with other policies under different scenarios. The results indicate that the threshold based proactive policy 
gives the minimum maintenance cost in almost all scenarios. Moreover, it is also successful in decreasing the number 
of maintenance in a planning horizon due to its effective component selection method at a maintenance time.

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to develop innovative techniques and combinations of constituents to use composites 
in agricultural, infrastructural and other relevant industries. Industrial, infrastructural, and biodegradable structural 
applications using hemp fibers are of interest to enhancing environmental sustainability. The products including 
graphite or hemp reinforced polymers with different volume fractions and orientations are considered. While a large 
number of products could be used in the commercial production, we explore only two laminates in this investigation. 
In this paper we are analyzing interlaminar stress components contributing to delamination of composite laminate. 
Using analytical techniques, effective response characteristics and interlaminar stresses of representative composites 
are predicted and given in this paper. Based upon this research a set of influencing factors will be identified, specific 
number of composite laminates will be chosen, manufactured, analyzed and tested for their performance 
characteristics. This is a step towards further research in progress for comparative studies between predicted and 
experimental values. We have used hemp fiber properties from reference [2]. For hemp fiber the Young’s modulus 
varies from 2.9 msi to 5.8 msi and Poisson ratio is 0.15. The matrix material properties of EPON 828 with Young’s 
modulus 0.42 msi and Poisson ratio 0.35 are used from reference [1]. For computation of effective properties of (0/90)s 
hemp reinforced composite laminates,  we have used Young’s modulus values 2.9 msi and 5.8 msi separately. Dr. 
Pagano [3] was the first to recognize the importance of interlaminar phenomena in high-performance composite 
materials. His discovery of the “stacking sequence phenomenon” led to new practices to reduce the potential for 
delamination.

1. Introduction
Composites have several advantages over conventional infrastructure and aircraft production materials, including 
reduced weight, reduced number of fasteners, corrosion resistance, and an extended product life. In addition, 
composites can be designed specifically for certain industrial applications to achieve desired stiffness and strength 
characteristics. Composites are used on virtually all Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems, civil engineering 
and medical applications. Composite structures are proven to reduce weight, fatigue, and corrosion damage, resulting 
in improved range, payload capability, speed/maneuverability, and stealth. The ability to custom design structural 
sections, key in the context of this research, reduces touch labor hours related to component production and 
development. The main disadvantage and largest criticism of using composite materials is the raw materials cost. The 
current life cycle cost models not taking into account various aspects of estimated cost-ratios is one of the most 
important challenges decision makers face in determining whether to continue or start production of a new structural 
system.

5.3 Discussion  
Tables 2 and 3 show the variation in effective stiffness properties of the (0/90)s laminates made with the change of 
hemp fiber properties 1): EA=2.9 msi,  ET =0.2 msi,  νAT=νTA=.15, GAT=1.01 msi; and 2): EA=5.8 msi, ET =0.4 msi,  
νAT=νTA=.15, GAT=2.02 msi; A stands for axial and T stands for transverse directions of the fiber; giving an idea as to 
how to design a composite for required applications.  
 
The variability of directional properties stimulates interlaminar stresses in figures 3 through 7. These results provide 
an indication as to the variation in the stress components at different locations of the laminate near the free edge. Using 
these stress components, appropriate criteria can be applied to predict the failure. 
 
5.4 Future Plans 
Central State University will be producing hemp fiber to develop our own products. The hemp thus produced will be 
tested to determine the mechanical properties, such as Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and tensile strength. A set of 
composite laminates will be identified, manufactured and tested. The composite analysis code, ASCA, will be used to 
analyze the laminates. A comparison of experimental and predicted response characteristics will be done to show the 
efficacy of models used. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A foundation is laid for doing mechanics-based research on hemp-fiber-reinforced composites. There has been 
increasing interest in this field. We have effectively used the mathematical models developed in ASCA for studying 
the response characteristics of Hemp/EPON 828 and AS4/H3501-6 laminates. Future studies will study and improve 
the hemp reinforced composites and products.

Abstract 
The prevalence of muscle fatigue among riveters and buckers in the aeronautical industry is predominantly linked to 
their significant exposure to excessive vibrations. Frequently surpassing the Daily Exposure Limit Value (DELV) of 
5 m/s², these skilled workers are subjected to elevated vibrations. To address this concern, the present research 
investigates the influence of different riveting tools on vibration exposure and muscle fatigue. While prior studies 
have individually examined these factors, a notable gap remains regarding comprehensive and concurrent 
investigations. Therefore, further exploration is imperative to enhance our understanding of this critical issue and 
potentially inform the development of effective mitigation strategies. An experimental study with ten male participants 
equally divided between riveters and buckers was performed to achieve the objective of this study. The task consisted 
of setting five rivets in 30 seconds. Acceleration, EMG, heart rate, handle orientation, and perceived exertion data 
were recorded simultaneously from riveters and buckers. The perceived exertion (Borg scale) was used to measure 
participants' overall perceived exertion level. The results indicate that the combined spring dampener and tungsten 
bucking bar led to 24.46% less vibration than the tungsten or steel bucking bar. In addition, the riveter gun operator 
with a vertical handle position resulted in the highest mean % MVC of the bucker's biceps brachii muscle (61.11%) 
compared to the riveter using the gun in the horizontal handle position (30.84%). The results demonstrate the need to 
consider the type of gun and handle position in which the rivet gun operator performs the task to reduce the effects of 
vibration exposure and muscle fatigue experienced by the riveters and buckers.

Supply Chain Responsiveness:  
Dimensions, Relationships and Impact on Performance

Abstract 
The increasing pace in the industry and the growing complexity of supply chains worldwide are incremental 
phenomena demanding changes and adaptation in terms of Supply Chain Management (SCM). However, no one could 
anticipate the profound impact caused by changes in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic, the magnitude of the 
disruptions, and their effects for such a long period. Companies need to reorganize and transform to accommodate 
and respond to shortages, market shifts, or product changes. More than being efficient, supply chains need to be 
responsive. Responsiveness enables supply chains to deliver the right product, at the right place, within an adequate 
time frame. However, research on how to develop responsive strategies applied to SCM is still scarce. As a concept, 
Responsiveness is well-defined and accepted as a relevant topic in the field. Some studies present conceptual models 
of responsiveness based on dimensions to be developed and managed by companies. Volume, product, and process 
have been proposed as dimensions of responsiveness. More recently, a new foundational theory emerged, addressing 
the dynamic potential of the supply chain and identifying responsiveness as the base upon which to build knowledge. 
According to this theory, responsiveness is achieved by combining five dimensions: adaptability, flexibility, agility, 
improvisation, and resilience. On the one hand, these dimensions represent no novelty to the field of SCM; on the 
other hand, there needs to be a clear indication of the right combination to achieve the desired level of responsiveness. 
In addition, it is relevant to ascertain the relationships identified between the dimensions. When an improvement in 
one of the dimensions leads to the same result in another one, synergies might be harvested. Still, it is necessary to 
consider the hypothesis of having dimensions competing for the same resources. In situations where such tensions 
arise, it is essential to discern and manage conflicting perspectives.  
This study adopts a theoretical responsiveness model proposed in the literature as the starting point for the work 
developed. The responsiveness dimensions included in the model are studied from two perspectives: first, the right 
combination of dimensions for the intended level of responsiveness and, second, the tensions between the different 
dimensions. In what concerns the first perspective, dynamic capabilities facilitate reaching the adequate combination 
of dimensions and pursuing the right strategy to achieve responsiveness. Regarding the second perspective, paradox 
theory provides a framework for understanding and managing tensions between responsiveness dimensions arising 
from competition for resources and inner conflicts. Finally, the impact of responsiveness on performance is studied, 
considering the moderating role of industry clockspeed, as different industries vary in pace, the company´s position 
in the supply chain, and environmental uncertainty.

Abstract 
This paper explores the intricate relationship between gender equity and diversity in academia, arguing that these two 
goals are not mutually exclusive or independent, but rather intricately intertwined. While existing discourse on gender 
equity in academia focuses primarily on the obstacles women face within the academic system, and discussions on 
diversity in academia concentrate on barriers preventing underrepresented groups from entering academia, this study 
contends that an intersectional framework is crucial for understanding and addressing inequalities within academic 
institutions. 
Drawing on the concept of intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989), our research applies process mining methodology (van 
der Aalst, 2016) to examine the inequalities prevalent among tenured academic staff in Israel. We collected data from 
university sites, encompassing approximately 400 tenure track members, and utilized the Celonis software to create a 
dashboard for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. 
By mapping the composition of the academic workforce and their promotion processes based on intersecting factors 
such as gender, ethnicity, and nationality, our study offers unique insights and demonstrates the potential of digital 
humanities in the Israeli context. The application of process mining techniques combined with the use of the Celonis 
software enables a detailed review of the collected data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the power 
dynamics and obstacles hindering true and sustainable equality in academic institutions. 
Building upon our prior research (Gigi, Nagar-Ron, Yehuda, and Razi, 2020), which highlighted the importance of 
intersectional analysis in understanding gender, ethnicity, and nationality dynamics among academic staff, we further 
expose the ethno-gendered and national-gendered nature of inequality. Additionally, our findings shed light on 
disparities in representation and advancement between first-tier academic institutions (universities) and second-tier 
ones (colleges). 
This paper presents preliminary research findings and emphasizes the significance of employing an intersectional lens 
to comprehensively grasp the diverse power mechanisms and obstacles hindering true and sustainable equality within 
academic institutions. The insights garnered from this study, facilitated by the utilization of process mining and 
Celonis software, have implications for both researchers and policymakers, fostering a more nuanced understanding 
of gender equity and diversity and aiding in the development of effective strategies to promote equality in academia.

chains, including supportive government policies, market acceptance, socio-economic benefits, financial challenges, 
and stakeholder empowerment. 
 
Policy Support: Both the systematic literature review and cross-case analysis emphasize the importance of favorable 
government policies in driving the valorization of residual biomass. Supportive policies incentivize and regulate 
biomass valorization, attract investments, and create a favorable environment for sustainable practices. 
 
Socio-economic Benefits: Biomass valorization has the potential to generate employment opportunities and foster 
socio-economic development in local communities, particularly in rural areas. Both the systematic literature review 
and cross-case analysis highlight job creation and rural development as drivers of biomass valorization. 
 
Market Acceptance and Financial Challenges: Market pressure for conventional products and lack of financial 
support are frequently appearing barriers to biomass valorization, as identified by the systematic review. The cross-
case analysis also discusses challenges related to market demand for traditional products and limited financial support 
mechanisms. Addressing these market barriers and financial challenges is crucial for enhancing the viability and 
competitiveness of biomass valorization projects. 
 
Empowerment of Stakeholders: Empowering stakeholders, including farmers, forest owners, and industry 
associations, is important for overcoming barriers and promoting fair pricing practices. The systematic review 
emphasizes the need to address the food versus fuel debate and promote market acceptance of biobased alternatives, 
while the cross-case analysis highlights the limited bargaining power of farmers and forest owners in negotiating 
biomass prices. Knowledge-sharing, training, and collaborative initiatives can enhance stakeholders’ bargaining 
power, address market challenges, and drive the adoption of biomass valorization. 
 
Understanding these key factors can help policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders make informed 
decisions and develop strategies to promote sustainable and efficient biomass valorization processes. 
 
Conclusion 
The analysis of the findings from the systematic literature review and the cross-case analysis provides a comprehensive 
understanding of the drivers and barriers in supply chain mapping studies for biomass valorization. Supportive 
government policies that incentivize and regulate the valorization of residual biomass promote sustainable practices 
and attract investment in the sector. The market’s inclination towards sustainable and renewable solutions is reflected 
in the increasing interest in biobased products. Job creation, particularly in rural areas, contributes to the socio-
economic development of local communities. 
However, several barriers hinder the widespread adoption of biomass valorization projects. Insufficient financial 
support mechanisms and high investment costs pose significant challenges. The dominance of conventional products 
and markets creates obstacles for the acceptance of biobased alternatives. Concerns over the impact of biomass 
production on food security and prices further complicate the debate. Balancing the use of agricultural resources for 
food production and energy production requires careful consideration and sustainable land-use planning. 
The cross-case analysis focuses on the operations and challenges within the supply chains of residual forestry biomass 
valorization. It reveals insights into transportation expenses and the bargaining power between farmers and logging 
companies. Material flow analysis facilitated decision-making on production planning and resource allocation. 
Strategies to optimize transportation efficiency were suggested to reduce costs and improve profitability. The limited 
bargaining power of farmers and forest owners in negotiating biomass prices leads to unfair trade practices. 
Empowering these stakeholders through knowledge-sharing initiatives can enhance their bargaining power. 
By understanding these findings, decision-makers can develop effective strategies to address financial challenges, 
create supportive policies, promote market acceptance of biomass valorization, optimize material flows, address 
transportation cost disparities, and enhance the bargaining power of stakeholders.

Abstract 
Nowadays, with the enormous competitiveness in the market, companies must adopt techniques that not only allow 
them to deliver a quality product but also help them predict situations of uncertainty regarding customer demand. 
Thus, it is imperative that some tools are integrated simultaneously throughout the production processes to achieve 
this goal. It is the only way for many companies to spot themselves in a significant market position, given that modern 
manufacturing demands not only more intelligence but also safer and more reliable process monitoring systems 
(Cheng et al. 2019). 
The study supervised in this document aimed to analyze the application of Statistical Process Control (SPC) in Industry 
4.0. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted, which allowed identifying the main approaches 
used to integrate statistical analysis with production processes in Industry 4.0, as well as the main tools and 
technologies employed for this purpose. A total of 21 articles were analyzed, considering inclusion and exclusion 
criteria related to the subject matter, with greater importance given to articles that explicitly addressed the integration 
between Industry 4.0 and SPC. 
According to the conducted systematic review, it was concluded that digital technologies are transforming SPC in 
Industry 4.0 in several ways. Some of the main transformations include: i) Real-time monitoring, as digital 
technologies allow processes to be monitored in real-time, enabling immediate problem detection and informed data-
driven decision-making; ii) Automation, as there are models and systems that already work with SPC and Industry 4.0 
technologies in a fully automated manner, increasing process efficiency and reducing the need for human intervention; 
iii) Advanced analysis, where digital technologies enable advanced analysis of collected data, allowing the
identification of patterns and trends that would be difficult or impossible to detect manually; iv) Integration with other
technologies, as SPC can be integrated with other Industry 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of
things, big data, among other tools, to create more comprehensive and efficient solutions.
In other words, digital technologies are enabling a significant transformation in SPC in Industry 4.0, making it more
efficient, accurate, and integrated with other available technological solutions.

The results showed that there are three major combined uses between SPC and Industry 4.0 technologies. The first, 
according to Atalay et al. (2020), Parto et al. (2020), Testik et al. (2020), and Udugama et al. (2020) describes how to 
apply Industry 4.0 tools in the context of SPC, but it is not applied in practice. This approach mentions the use of 
Sensors, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. 
In a second approach, according to Chen (2022), Destro et al. (2020), Fogliazza et al. (2021), Packianather et al. 
(2019), and Blanco-Montenegro et al. (2007) it is mentioned how Industry 4.0 tools complement SPC with limited 
automation. The mentioned tools are Expert Systems, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Machine 
Vision, and Motion Caption System. 
Lastly, in a final approach, according to Bodur et al. (2020), Dutta et al. (2021), Cohen and Singer, (2021), and Singer 
and Cohen (2021) it was concluded that there are models and systems that already work with SPC and Industry 4.0 
technologies in a fully automated manner. The discussed tools included 3D printing, Internet of Things, Cyber Physical 
System, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. 
Ultimately, it can be concluded that, in the short term, Industry 4.0 and its new business models are the key, however, 
the market will continue to evolve to a point where all organizations will need to adapt to new trends (de la Torre and 
Sanchez 2022). According to Yüksel (2020), it can be stated that companies that produce highly technological products 
are more likely to develop Industry 4.0 applications and to implement Industry 4.0 technologies. 
Industry 4.0 and SPC are areas that are constantly evolving and offer many opportunities for future work. As the 
literature shows, it is possible to work with these two major approaches together, and in this document, only an analysis 
of what already exists is presented. However, it is relevant to emphasize that several case studies can be developed 
based on the conclusions drawn here. One possibility is the development of artificial intelligence systems to enhance 
SPC, as AI can be used to analyze large amounts of real-time data collected through sensors and help identify patterns 
and anomalies in processes. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that Statistical Process Control can be 
a valuable tool to improve the efficiency and quality of industrial processes in Industry 4.0, as long as it is applied 
appropriately and integrated with available digital technologies.

Abstract 
Since Industry 4.0, development in automation technology cases a transformation in many industries to integrate the 
latest technology and reinforce human-automation collaboration in cyber-physical systems. It is expected such 
collaboration can leverage the capabilities of both human and automation agents and achieve team synergy. To achieve 
this objective, this paper proposes dynamic task allocation considering human factors for human-automation 
symbiosis. In this paper, analysis and design of the team cognition-aware task allocation system are elaborated. The 
task allocation problem is formulated with team cognitive performance in the optimization objective function. A two-
dimensional genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this allocation problem. An application case of medical product 
assembly is presented to validate the proposed solution.

1. Introduction
Recent years have witnessed rapid development in automation technology since Industry 4.0, which not only enhances 
the operational capabilities of automation agents through advanced hardware technologies and control theory, but also 
facilitates the cognition capabilities using artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques. Within this process, the 
importance of human operators in the automation system is changing, too (Endsley 2017). In the beginning, the role 
of human operators is to monitor and intervene the automation system when hardware or software cannot complete 
its tasks. As the communication techniques advance, there is a trend for keeping the human in-the-loop and thus 
operators take more responsibilities (Sahinel et al. 2021). The objective of such involvement is to enable the

7. Managerial Implications 
There are many practical benefits and profound significances for studying and implementing human-automation 
symbiosis. Firstly, it could facilitate the design and operation of practical applications in different environment. 
Secondly, it can improve team performance, increase operation safety and avoid human errors. Thirdly, it proposes 
solutions to allocating tasks appropriately to leverage advantages of different agents and to increase operator 
satisfaction, so that the industry can maintain the operation level when there are not enough operators. Fourthly, it can 
help prepare human operators for new techniques by understanding how automation agents influence human 
cognition, behavior, and required skills. Nowadays artificial intelligence has made huge breakthroughs, and some 
generative artificial intelligence and large language models have already been applied to real-world problems. 
Understanding human-automation symbiosis can better utilize the cognitive capabilities from these techniques. 
 
8. Conclusions 
This paper presents the system design and methodology for dynamic task allocation considering team cognitive 
performance to achieve human-automation symbiosis. It proposes the approach to modeling human-related factors, 
including cognitive state, human trust, level of automation, and team cognition. These factors are integrated into the 
task allocation problem, which is formulated as an optimal assignment problem with the objective function being the 
sum of financial cost, time cost, and team cognitive performance. A 2D genetic algorithm approach is proposed to 
solve the formulated problem. It also presents an application case of medical product assembly for validating the 
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution. 
 
There are several contributions of this work. Firstly, it proposes the comprehensive system analysis and design for 
task allocation decision-making towards human-automation symbiosis. Secondly, it formulates the dynamic task 
allocation problem between human and automation agents with human factors considered. Thirdly, it proposes a 2D 
genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem.

The Impact of Supply Chain Management on South 
African Local Government Municipalities’ 
 Financial Performance

Abstract 
The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of supply chain management (SCM) on the operations of Ekurhuleni 
Metropolitan Municipality (EMM), a local municipality in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. This aim is 
intended to enhance supply chain management efficiency and effectiveness at EMM and other related local 
government municipalities in South Africa with a view to enhance institutional performance. The study was 
necessitated by the wide spread reported SCM challenges facing the South African local government. Quantitative 
research, descriptive research and explanatory research were employed in the investigation. The findings of the 
study confirmed that SCM has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance of the metropolitan 
municipality. 
Introduction 
Supply chain management is critical in the financial management for the public sector in South Africa. An 
ineffective and inefficient supply chain management leads to poor financial management in any entity whether 
public entity or private entity. EMM has been struggling with weaknesses in its supply chain management system 
(Legodi  2017:58). In the 2016/2017 financial year the metropolitan municipality failed to get a clean audit. This 
was largely attributed to irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure (Annual Financial Report 2017). 
The government has put measures in place to ensure the local government municipalities like EMM enhance their 
supply chain management function. Upon attaining democratic rule in 1994, the South African government put in 
place budgetary and financial reforms on supply chain management (Ambe & Badenhorst-Weiss, 2012:245). The 
reforms were earmarked to modernise the supply chain management as well as to meet the needs of communities. 
The supply chain management reform is articulated in Section 112 of the Municipal Financial Management Act 
No 56 of 2003 (MFMA) and in 76(4) (C) of the Public Finance Management Act No 1 of 1999 (PFMA) (Ambe 
& Badenhorst-Weiss 2012:245). Thus, the reforms in procurement in the public sector are made mandatory by 
existing Acts of Parliament. This makes non-compliance with the reforms a criminal offence. 
The National Treasury is at the forefront of ensuring all public sector institutions are complying with reform 
clauses in the MFMA and PFMA. There is also the Auditor General South Africa (AGSA), an independent public 
external audit institution that audits the public sector institutions annually to ensure they are complying with 
relevant clauses in the MFMA and PFMA.  
 Despite the efforts of the National Treasury to capacitate personnel in local government municipalities with 
relevant skills, implementation of supply chain management remains a challenge in the municipalities (Ambe & 
Badenhorst-Weiss 2012:11003). According to Ambe and Badenhorst-Weiss (2012 :11003), major deficiencies 
relating to supply chain management in local government municipalities relate to procurement policies, 
procedures and controls. This study has been carried out in the context of supply chain management deficiencies 
in the local government municipalities despite the efforts by the government to enhance supply chain management 
systems in the public sector. The Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality is not an exception to the supply chain 
management weaknesses that are being faced by other municipalities in South Africa.

Abstract 
LabChem'S Corp. in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, is facing challenges with long waiting times and delays in sample 
delivery due to their telephone-based service request management system. To address these issues and improve their 
operational efficiency, the company is exploring using Markov chains to establish order request transition 
probabilities. This methodology has been successfully used in other supply chain projects to minimize costs and 
improve lead times. Then, can LabChem’S Corp. make its process efficient by knowing in advance (the next 2 to 4 
weeks) order request transition probabilities while drivers are already on the route? Our project aims to design and 
implement a streamlined service request management system that will enhance LabChem'S Corp.’s sample collection 
and analysis process. For example, the highest transition probabilities for the fourth week were 0.3874 (April) and 
0.3229 (May) for transitions between states 2-3 and 4-3. These results suggest that efforts should be focused on 
preventing events originating in states 2, 3, and 4. Ultimately, this proposed service request management system could 
serve as a valuable model for other companies seeking to improve their competitiveness in the marketplace.

1. Introduction
This research aims to address the problem of LabChem’S Corp., a company located in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, which 
currently uses a telephone-based system for requesting sample collection and analysis services. This method results 
in long wait times for customers because there is no set limit for service requests. The problem is compounded by the 
fact that drivers are assigned to customers on a first-come, first-served basis, which disrupts their daily routes and 
delays the samples’ delivery to the laboratory. The motivation for solving this problem is to improve LabChem’S 
Corp.’s service quality and customer satisfaction and to increase the company's competitiveness in the marketplace. 
Markov Chains are proposed to calculate transition probabilities for the current system order request events and reduce 
waiting times in this research. Then, can LabChem’S Corp. make its process efficient by knowing in advance (the 
next 2 to 4 weeks) order request transition probabilities while drivers are already on the route? 
We will describe the current system used by LabChem’S Corp., the limitations and problems associated with it, and 
the potential benefits of the new service request management process design. We will also discuss the importance of 
this study in terms of its potential to serve as a model for other companies facing similar service request management 
challenges. This research aims to design a new company service request management process to reduce waiting times 
and streamline the sample collection and analysis. In addition, by improving LabChem’S Corp.’s efficiency and 
effectiveness, we hope to enhance the company's reputation and customer satisfaction.

6. Future Work  
For future work, it was proposed that the company implement an automated digital system that allows customers to 
place orders and check their status. In addition, it will notify them when their order has been processed, and a driver 
has been assigned to their route. This work is expected to improve the quality of the process and customer reliability. 
This is ultimately the most important thing for the company to attract more customers and, as a result, improve 
revenues throughout this process. 
 
7. Conclusion  
In this research, we propose using Markov Chains to improve the service request process of LabChem'S Corp. and 
reduce their waiting times. By analyzing data and applying n-step transition probabilities and Chapman-Kolmogorov 
Equations from Markov Chains, we set the grounds for the company so they can improve their efficiency. Performing 
this analysis, LabChem'S Corp. could also improve its service request process, reduce waiting times, and increase 
customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the company can use the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to calculate the n-step 
transition probabilities for a Markov chain and use this information to make informed decisions and improve the 
efficiency of the process.  
 
The design of this new service request management process for LabChem'S Corp. will increase efficiency, reduce 
waiting times, and increase customer satisfaction. It also will facilitate identifying and prioritizing the improvement 
of critical areas inside the company’s service request process and develop an action plan to address these areas of 
concern. By analyzing the transition probabilities associated with different scenarios, we were able to identify areas 
of opportunity and develop strategies that will be useful to improve the quality of the process. These strategies included 
strengthening customer communication channels, implementing a service request template, and establishing clear 
request timelines.  
 
When comparing April and May data, we observed variations in transition probabilities associated with LabChem'S 
Corp. service requests. This data analysis exercise reinforced the importance of proposed improvements, such as 
validating route availability and improving customer communication channels. In addition, the analysis helped 
LabChem'S Corp. understand the impact of these events on the process and enabled it to make informed decisions to 
improve efficiency and turnaround times. Therefore, by applying Markov Chains and analyzing the data, we provided 
LabChem'S Corp. with valuable information and recommendations to improve its service request process. The

proposed improvements are intended to increase customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and contribute to the 
overall success of LabChem'S Corp. In general, we can determine that the framework and strategies suggested in this 
research will help the company to meet the proposed objectives. Furthermore, the n-step transition probabilities 
obtained were essential to compare and carry forward to future weeks. Therefore, the company could monitor if they 
went up or down. The purpose is to demonstrate that if these transition probabilities continue to increase shortly, they 
directly affect the customer by increasing the waiting time to attend to their requests and decreasing LabChem'S 
profits.

Abstract 
Automotive component manufacturers are some of the organizations that are faced with a lot of complexities in 
their manufacturing streams. These complexities require a number of changeovers on the lines according to the 
sequences and derivatives that are required by customers. One of the challenges that component manufacturers 
face is the outflow of defective parts post their changeovers which hinders the ability to deliver and reduces 
capacities. An automotive component manufacturer which manufactures various bedliners was concerned about 
the outflow of defective parts after every changeover on their Thermoforming line. This pointed directly to a lack 
of built-in-quality in their changeover processes. This was primarily reflected in their approach of frequently 
adjusting the moulding machine and relentless reworking of the work being done in the moulds after changeover 
completion. This resulted in multiple destructive tests, high defect rates, and major delays in their ability to run 
the line and deliver to their customers. Given the magnitude of the problem in the organization, the aim of this 
study was to utilize the Lean Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) methodology 
to bring about significant improvement in driving built-in-quality in the changeover process execution for the line. 
The results of the study were a streamlined approach to this problem, reduced defect occurrences after 
changeovers, and an overall changeover process that encompasses a built-in-quality approach in its execution.

1. Introduction
Process changeovers in manufacturing organizations hold core to the mainstream of operations. These 
changeovers are a necessity to drive the much-needed flexibility of manufacturing to live up to the expectations 
of delivering various product ranges. According to Sugarinda et al. (2019) changeovers are fundamental to the 
production of the right products that are required by customers. The improvement around changeovers is mostly 
attributed to the Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) methodology (Garcia-Garcia 2022), which focuses 
primarily on the reduction of the time it takes to complete the changeovers. What is often not considered in the 
process is the number of defective parts that are incurred after the changeovers are completed. The occurrence of 
such defects can be attributed to a lack of built-in-quality in the execution of the changeovers. Built-in-quality in 
the aspect of changeovers talks to the quality of application of material, correct positioning of tools and equipment, 
correct flow of materials, and proper tightening of tools and equipment. In the context of the Thermoforming 
manufacturing line, the changeovers occur on the main machine moulding process. These changeovers come in 
the form of changing of entire moulds or changing of inserts inside the moulds. The absences of quality sanity 
checks in the activities involved in the execution of the changeovers present many challenges that often result in 
poor quality products. Stapelbroek et al. (2022) advises that ensuring quality check completion during changeover 
processes is a significant approach towards attaining good quality first time through products. The checks are 
often ignored in the interest of completion time or omitted in the changeover procedures during the design phase 
of the process. There is little literature centred around the reduction of changeover defects and building-in-quality 
in the execution of the changeover processes. Most literature from various authors focuses on overcoming time

6. Conclusion 
The study employed the lean six sigma DMAIC methodology to streamline an approach towards developing a 
built-in-quality centred approach to changeovers. The DMAIC methodology has proven to be effective in this 
study, as it established to a large extent a pathway for automotive component manufacturers to follow in order to 
drive quality in their changeover processes. The study has unearthed to an extent that there is largely ignorance 
around built-in-quality in changeover processes. The focus is primarily on the quickest way to wrap up 
changeovers and giving less consideration to the quality of products after the changeovers. The automotive 
component manufacturer needed to incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach to the execution of changeovers. 
The employment of built-in-quality strategies during changeovers brings into light significant benefits such as 
reduced defective unit outflow, increased capacities, ability to cope with complexities, and increased profitability. 
The first objective of the study was met through an outline of the possible defects, causes and the elements 
associated with the occurrence of the defects. This was outlined on the data collection phase of the study under

the improvement stage of the DMAIC methodology. The second objective of the study was attained through a 
range of comparison results measured overtime for the periods where changeovers had no built-in-quality and 
post the implementation of improvements to drive built-in-quality in the changeover process. The third objective 
of the study was achieved through a strict following of the DMAIC methodology phases to bring improvements 
to the changeover process. The development of a new multi-disciplinary check sheet that drove parameter and 
standards checks addressed the last objective of the study. Majority of studies about changeovers from various 
authors are centred around the SMED approach. There is little or no dedicated focus on curbing defective parts 
after changeovers have taken place. The study presents a pathway for further research to be conducted around the 
development of a quality mindset or culture during the execution of changeovers.

Abstract 
Supply chain risk management has raised companies' and researchers' focus on the supply chain environment. The 
definition and consequences of risk in a company's supply chain depend on its position and the depth of analysis it 
can conduct. Developing Countries' companies, such as those in Albania, perceive supply chain risk management as 
an expenditure that does not generate profit, so they do not allocate funds or personnel to it. The recent financial 
crisis caused by the consequences of Covid-19 worldwide suggested that countries urgently need to implement 
effective risk management processes in all sectors of the economy. Companies must understand which risks should 
be accepted, avoided, transferred, mitigated, or exploited. This article studies a company in the Albanian Textile 
industry using Hierarchical Holographic Modeling (HHM). The model implemented involved assigning risk 
management responsibilities to a specific employee over time limit intervals. Furthermore, the company's overall 
risk management capabilities and competencies are enhanced as an intangible outcome. This article aims to identify 
strategies the company uses to mitigate risks and improve the performance of the supply chain. From the results 
obtained from this article, managerial perceptivity can be deduced on how to manage supply chain risk in the future. 
Keywords: Risk Management, Supply Chain, Hierarchical Holographic Modeling (HHM), Decision-making, Risk 
Matrix. 
1. Introduction
The operational environment of a company is influenced by numerous uncertainties, which have both positive and 
negative effects. Risk and uncertainty are often used interchangeably, but they are different. Risk comes from 
uncertainty, which has a few possibilities. (Lavastre O. et al. 2013) define risk as the probability of a loss for the 
company/ the individual.  
Supply Chain Risk Management is a systematic and phased approach for recognizing, evaluating, ranking, 
mitigating, and monitoring potential disruptions in the supply chain (Aqlan F. and Lam S. 2016). Supply Chain Risk 
Management's primary objective is to safeguard the company from unfavorable events. 
The past decade has seen the introduction of a vast array of tools and techniques for supply chain risk management. 
Hierarchical Holographic Modeling (HHM) is a structured and analytical model developed because capturing all the 
essential and vital aspects of a risk system in a single model is complex. One of the most essential and valuable 
aspects of HHM is the ability to facilitate the evaluation of risks regardless of whether an immense amount of data 
and their related contributions to the entire structure are attainable. Various models that represent what is essential to 
the numerous measurements, dreams or visions and viewpoints of infrastructure systems can be developed and 
coordinated using HHM. 
It is crucial to emphasize that Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) presents a framework incorporating the 
techniques and procedures companies use to manage risks directly associated with accomplishing their goals. Risk 
filtering, ranking, and management (RFRM) systematically evaluate all significant risks. HHM, SCRM, and RFRM 
could be incorporated into a risk management model that bridges the divide between industrial-level risk 
management and company-level risk management to create an integrated and systematic model of risk management.

6. Conclusion 
The proposed risk management model provides a comprehensive risk analysis tool using a top-down approach 
which helps a company understand its risks better and have a better chance of success. Applying the HHM and 
SCRM, risks have been identified, and the company could prioritize risks so that options to mitigate the risk can be 
appropriately considered and addressed. Most of the uncertainties and risks that the Textile industry is facing have 
been identiﬁed by HHM. The most likely and high-level risks in the industry are identiﬁed. SCRM method was 
applied to identify the company`s risks, triggers, and current mitigation strategies. 
Furthermore, some additional outstanding risks are provided for the case company to avoid or transfer those risks. 
The proposed model provides theoretical merits to the literature and applies to different industries for risk 
management practices. Today, customer has higher expectations in terms of speed of delivery and service quality. It 
is challenging for a company to sustain efﬁcient product ﬂow and on-time delivery simultaneously. In order to 
ensure the ﬂexibility of the supply chain, a company should have internal competencies to manage its external 
partners. Therefore, further research is required to combine the risk management model with the customer and 
supplier relationship management concept.

Abstract 
The lack of inclusive educational interventions for children with behavioural disorders exacerbates the 
already concerning problem of school failure in Peru. There is a scarcity of educational proposals that 
intertwine psychology and engineering, leaving the study of the impacts of postural ergonomics on 
selective attention unattended despite the frequent mismatch between the furniture and the student’s 
anthropometric measurements. Consequently, this interdisciplinary research, through a case study of 
Peruvian primary school children disaggregated into ADHD (neurodivergent) and non-ADHD 
(neurotypical) samples, evaluates the impact of postural ergonomics on selective attention and further 
assesses the difference between the magnitude of such impact on the neurodivergent and neurotypical 
samples. The impact assessment is based on the correlation between the d2R test for selective attention 
results and the evaluation of postural ergonomic correctness. Results from the paired T-test coupled with a 
Cohen’s-D of over 1.95 demonstrate that correct ergonomic posture leads to a significant improvement in 
selective attention and that such improvement is +1.5 points higher for neurotypicals than for 
neurodivergents. Ultimately, to provide a tangible improvement to education, and after defining the 
incoherence between current school furniture and the sample’s anthropometric measurements, 
recommended measurements for adjustable furniture for Peruvian schools that ensure correct postural 
ergonomics are proposed.

1. Introduction
In Peru 1 out every 10 children suffer from learning difficulties, and over 75,000 of them have attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Peñahora and Álvarez 2018). In fact, 16% of the 19-year-old Peruvian 
population has not been able to complete their school studies. Consequently, in 2018 under the law Nº30797 
inclusive education was promoted, yet not clear policies have been established (Galarreta and Mantilla 
2018). 
On the other hand, the incoherence between school furniture and the student’s anthropometric 
measurements is a global issue (Ansari et al. 2018; Carneiro et al. 2017; Gligorović et al. 2018; Lee and 
Yun 2019; Teferi and Sefene 2021) which jeopardizes both, learning and health, and is extremely 
pronounced in Peru. In fact, 50% of Peruvian public schools have deficient infrastructure and, due to 
COVID-19, over 500,000 students have had to transfer from private to public schools just in Lima 
(ElPeruano 2022).  This conundrum is even more alarming as students spend between 70%-90% of their 
time sitting down (Manca et al. 2020; Prieto-Lage et al. 2021) and it is known that incorrect postural 
ergonomics predisposes the individual to develop musculoskeletal disorders (Minghelli et al. 2021, Moshki 
and Mohammadipour 2020) and pain (Carneiro et al. 2017). While ergonomic programs seeking

school furniture guidance but the misuse or even worse, the lack of emphasis that public education puts on 
schoolchildren ergonomics. Ultimately, this investigation intends to highlight such conundrum, calls for the 
implementation of the advised measurements, and strives to portray the usefulness and value of interdisciplinary 
research.

Abstract 
The lighting system is an essential component of any industrial city's infrastructure for drivers' safety to prevent accidents and 
facilitate ease of guidance as an accessibility manner to the city. However, street lighting accounts for a significant portion of 
the overall energy consumption in industrial cities that does not reflect the actual vehicles passing the street or the intended 
purpose of the lights. In this paper, we propose a smart sensing model to reduce street lights' electrical consumption based on 
demand using an Internet of Things (IoT) camera with a License Plate Recognition (LPR) function that detects vehicles. If a 
vehicle is detected using LPR, the street lights will be turned on for 15 seconds to allow the vehicle to pass the street, then turn 
off part of the street lights if no other vehicles are detected as an ideal status of the lights. Our results concluded that the 
proposed smart sensing model accomplishes its objective by achieving the highest street light electrical reduction in one hour 
across five days, which is 89.17 % for half of the lights controlled using IoT. Moreover, the highest average reduction for all 
five days with a period of 12 hours is 74.09% compared to regular status.

Introduction: 
The continual population growth demands an expansion of cities and increased energy produced to fulfill future demands. This 
is considered to be proportional to the increase in the number of streets which leads to higher light consumption. Therefore, 
innovative solutions become necessary to help reduce electrical consumption and account for the potential growth in industrial 
cities. The advancement of new technologies, such as the internet of things (IoT), helped track and monitor electrical 
consumption and can be used as a part of the solution to reduce electrical consumption. The smart city concept has become 
essential to provide enhancement on facilities and services that make a smart city required as demand-based needs, such as in 
water supply, electrical supply, housing, hospital, mobile and internetwork, connectivity, transport facilities, street lighting, etc 
(Mohandas et al.  2019). Such demand required new approaches to the integration of advanced technologies to apply 
enhancements. The IoT helps to reach energy efficiency, reduce the cost of operation, and optimize the use of energy. The IoT 
can help reduce the impact of energy on the environment and play an essential role in minimizing electrical consumption, 
leading to enhanced efficiency, and reduced operational cost. Another critical function of IoT is to seamlessly interconnect 
different numbers of devices, processes, people, and data to provide automated decision-making in real-time (Motlagh et al. 
2020). Furthermore, linking diverse aspects of enterprise with using information and communication technology is considered 
the main principle of industrial 4.0 (Mohamed et al.  2019).  
The kingdom of Saudi Arabia started many initiatives to reduce energy consumption as part of the kingdom's Vision 2030 and 
relies on a mix of other renewable energy sources despite that the kingdom is one of the largest oil-producing countries. Such 
an initiative aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and account for the increase of future demands of energy. The industrial 
city concept of providing the necessary infrastructure for factories and attracting is considered one of the important elements 
of the Saudi vision 2030 for the diversification of the economy. The current number of industrial cities is seventy-six, and they 
have over ten thousand factories in different sectors. This research is important to highlight and emphasize that energy can be 
saved and operated as needed for the purpose intended while not impacting the level of safety in the street, which is considered 
an essential factor for the existing function of lights in streets. This research proposes a demand-based approach for operating 
street lights in an industrial city using IoT that detects vehicles entering the city and act accordingly to operate the lights. This 
research will prove the possibility of the proposed model to lead to a potential reduction of electrical consumption using a 
forecasting method.

The smart sensing model has proven to reduce street light electrical consumption by utilizing the internet of things IoT License 
Plate Recognition LPR camera with accounting for pedestrians using the sidewalk in the street by allowing half of the street 
light to always be ON. The smart sensing model overall reduced electrical consumption by an average of 32.39% across all 
days. The most cost reduction has been reached on day two (37.04%). The normal cost for day two is 108.9 SR and with 
implementing, the smart sensing model the cost would be 68.56 SR with a total saving of 40.34 SR. 
 
Conclusions:  
The smart sensing model will reduce street lights electrical consumption. The primary aspect for utilizing IoT cameras in the 
smart sensing model is the cost-effectiveness, that allows for street lights to be operated based on demand of actual vehicles 
entering the street. The smart sensing model proposed to reduce the street light electrical consumption and the fundamental 
components of the model are to have the lights turned on for 15 seconds and 50% of the street lights will be on all the time. 
Therefore, based on the work presented in this research, here are some recommendations that can be potential of future work 
as following:  
 
• 
A higher reduction can be reached if the delay 15 seconds were lower. This depends on the street length and other factors 
such as vehicles seed limit, number of lanes and others.  
• 
The lowering of the 50% percentage of street lights that is set to be on all the time will lead to further reduction. Therefore, 
more optimistic results will be, but must account for the adhering of safety requirements for pedestrians and vehicles 
stopped on the side of the main road.  
• 
The number of the industrial city’s main entrances and size of the of the industrial city will influence the  reduction of 
street lights electrical consumptions.  
• 
The scaling of the smart sensing model to not only be utilized on the main road, but also expanding it all street lights in 
the industrial city.  
• 
Setting a predefine delay to not be fix as 15 seconds, but to be as per the type of vehicles detected. The truck time delay 
should be different than the small vehicle or other type of vehicles as the speed is different. This can be achieved using 
the  LPR provides in its data the type of plate number detected based on the color coding.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to apply Lean and Six Sigma techniques in Indian hospital to investigate the barriers in length of stay (LOS) 
period of Intestinal obstruction patients. The Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyse-Improve-Control) procedure is being applied 
along with standard Lean tools. The detailed data of patients are observed over a period of eight months. The mean LOS is computed to be 
11.55 days with standard deviation of 3.34 days. The value stream mapping is used to find various non-value added activities and Fishbone 
diagram is utilized to determine root causes of the process. Patient’s feedback and GEMBA observations are used to validate the possible 
causes for the problem. It is observed that nearly 70% of total LOS is non-value added time and can be minimized to reduce the LOS. The 
waiting time for surgery, time for admission, time for discharge, lack of motivation from doctors, etc. are identified as root causes for the 
process. It is concluded that Lean and Six Sigma methodologies have great potential to produce clinically significant improvement for 
surgical patients.

Introduction 
Yeo et al. (2012) stated that intestinal obstruction is a kind of disease, which has been reported throughout history with cases detailed in the 
Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BC and by Hippocrates. According to Wang et al. (2015), there are 3.2 million cases of Intestinal obstruction in 2015 
throughout the globe and unfortunately, 2,64,000 of them died. Specifically, in India, there are more than 1 million cases per year. Ferri 
(2014) analyzed that this disease, which can occur at any age and affects both sexes equally. Intestinal obstruction is a condition in which 
digested material is prevented from passing though bowl. Pujahari (2016) found that symptoms include severe bloating, abdominal pain, 
vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, etc. Gore et al. (2015) concluded that the X-ray is usually required for the diagnosis; however, it is more accurate 
to perform CT scan and patient may be treated conservatively or with surgery depends upon the condition.   
Several studies have shown important concern for the surgery like reducing waiting time, decreasing length of stay (LOS) after surgery, etc. 
Taner et al. (2007) reduced the waiting time of patients before surgery using Six Sigma. Parks et al. (2008) applied the Lean and Six Sigma 
approach in trauma centre of the hospital and they were able to reduce reactivation units’ dwell time by one hour. Allen et al. (2010) focused 
on the hospital discharge process using Six Sigma DMAIC approach. They lowered down the average discharge time to 2.8 hours from 3.3 
hours. Sedlack (2010) used Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define- Measure- Analyse- Improve- Control) procedure to reduce waiting time of 
surgeon between the cases. Taner (2013) lowered down the complications of cataract surgery using Six Sigma. Alkinaidri and Alsulami 
(2018) improved the delays in referral system of hospital using Lean Six Sigma. Molla et al. (2018) improved the timeliness of the discharge 
process of the hospital using Lean Six Sigma. Suman and Prajapati (2018) reported that the use of Lean and Six Sigma in Indian healthcare 
sector is very limited. Therefore, the present paper is an attempt to apply these quality initiatives in a northern Indian government hospital. 
In this paper, Lean and Six Sigma tools are integrated to streamline processes and decrease the LOS period for Intestinal obstruction patients 
in surgery department. Al-Qatawneh et al. (2019) provided a proposed framework to apply Six Sigma in the area of healthcare logistics. Al-
Zain et al. (2019) reduced the patient waiting time using Lean Six Sigma in obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. Davies et al. (2019) optimized

Table 1 gives the various aspects of project i.e. project title, reason for selecting project, team description, etc. The mean and standard 
deviation for LOS is computed as 11.55 days and 3.34 days respectively.  
 
Lean tool i.e. value stream mapping is used to find the various value added and non-value added time during the entire process as shown in 
Figure 2. The mapping does not include the healing time as well as pre-operative conservative time as this varies from patient to patient. 
This includes steps like triage, registration, preparation of patient, etc., whose time is standard and can help in finding non-value added time 
based on the observation. It is observed that nearly 70% of the total time is non-value added and can be minimised to reduce the time spent 
by the patient in surgery department. The cause and effect analysis is performed with LOS as effect and possible causes are brainstormed. 
The thirteen causes are shortlisted after discussions with doctors and staff members. Patient’s feedback survey and GEMBA observations 
are used to validate the possible causes. The survey questionnaire is constructed on 5-point likert scale where one represents minimum 
satisfied and five shows maximum satisfied. The project leader decides that average satisfaction level less than 3 is considered as root causes 
of the problem. After survey, waiting time for surgery, time for admission, lack of motivation from doctors are identified as root causes for 
problem. 
 
GEMBA method is used to validate the causes and these causes are: untrained staff, wrong equipment sent to OT, lack of material handling 
devices, doctor’s preferred setting, post-operative complications and poor hygiene.  So total of seven factors are shortlisted after validation 
by both the methods. Based on the root causes, possible feasible solutions are suggested to the hospital administration to reduce barriers 
within the process. The recommended solutions include fast documentation system, readymade discharge template, proper motivation from 
doctors for the patient, proper training of staff, etc.  
 
The present research is limited to determine bottlenecks and provide recommendations to the hospital administration to reduce LOS period. 
The cost analysis of the suggested recommendations can also be done in future, which will help hospital administration and staff to correlate 
between investment and quality improvement in their services. 
 
4.  CONCLUSIONS 
The present paper is basically an initiative to apply Lean and Six Sigma methodologies in Indian healthcare sector. Although, Lean and Six 
Sigma are being widely applied in healthcare throughout globe but its application in India is very limited. The detailed study of procedure 
staring from the patient’s entry into the department to their discharge has been done to find the bottlenecks within the process. After 
discussions with doctors, possible solutions are suggested to increase quality of the process. Finally, it can be concluded that these 
methodologies have the potential to produce clinically significant improvement for surgical patients.

Abstract 
In the current era, one of the key challenges in utilizing the Holt-Winters Method of forecasting is the accurate 
selection of smoothing coefficients. To address this issue, researchers have explored an optimization approach that 
aims to minimize forecasting errors, such as Mean Squared Errors (MSE) or Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). This 
paper presents a novel methodology that employs a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the forecasting error by 
determining the optimal smoothing coefficients for the Holt-Winters Method. The objective value of the optimization 
problem is the Mean Square Error (MSE), which serves as a measure of the accuracy of the forecast. To evaluate the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach, actual test cases based on rice stock commercial commodity in the Philippines 
during the COVID-19 pandemic were utilized. The paper examines different variants of the Holt-Winters Method and 
assesses their suitability for capturing the characteristics of the rice stock data. The findings indicate that an additive 
seasonal effect is more appropriate for modeling the seasonal patterns observed in the rice stock data. Furthermore, 
the performance of the proposed GA-based approach is compared to other forecasting models to ascertain its efficacy. 
The results demonstrate promising outcomes, suggesting that the GA-based optimization approach for determining 
the smoothing coefficients in the Holt-Winters Method improves the accuracy of rice stock forecasting during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on various sectors, including the rice stock commodity in the 
Philippines. The pandemic disrupted global supply chains, affected labor availability, and created logistical 
challenges, all of which had repercussions on the rice market in the country. During the pandemic, the Philippines, 
like many other nations, faced uncertainties and concerns regarding food security. Hilhorst, Mijatović, and Ramos 
(2021) presents a comprehensive review of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food systems worldwide. It

Considering a large discrepancy in optimal MSE for the additive and multiplicative seasonal effects (see Table 1), it 
is surprising that the forecasted values for 2023 was almost the same for both seasonal effects. It shows that for this 
data and COVID-19 pandemic situation, both seasonal effects can accurately be used to forecast commercial rice stock 
in the Philippines. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper develops an accurate prediction method using Genetic Algorithm (GA) in optimizing the Mean Squared 
Error (MSE) that recommends smoothing coefficients of the Holt-Winters forecasting model. The effectiveness of the 
proposed method was verified using actual commercial rice stock data in the Philippines during COVID-19 pandemic 
situation. Different seasonal effects of the Holt-Winters forecasting model were observed and the result shows that

multiplicative seasonal effect was more appropriate for the commercial rice stock data. The results shows that even 
multiplicative seasonal effect shows robustness over additive seasonal effect, the resulting forecasted data for the next 
seasonal year was almost the same. 
 
One of the practical implications of this study is to improve decision making.  Accurate short-term forecasting of rice 
stock is crucial for decision-making by government authorities, policymakers, and traders involved in managing the 
rice market during the pandemic. The study's findings and the proposed methodology can enhance the accuracy of 
forecasting, enabling better decision-making regarding production, distribution, import/export activities, and stock 
management. In addition, it enhanced Food security, rice is a staple food, and ensuring an adequate rice stock is 
essential for maintaining food security, especially during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. The study's 
optimization approach using the Genetic Algorithm-Based Holt-Winters Method can contribute to more precise 
forecasts of rice stock levels, facilitating proactive measures to address potential shortages or fluctuations in supply 
and stabilize prices. Moreover, Accurate short-term forecasting helps optimize resource allocation within the rice 
sector. By utilizing the proposed methodology, stakeholders can better allocate resources, such as labor, transportation, 
and storage facilities, based on the forecasted demand and stock levels. This can lead to improved efficiency and cost-
effectiveness in the supply chain, benefiting farmers, traders, and consumers. Lastly, its adaptability to other 
commodity forecasting, While the study focuses on rice stock forecasting, the methodology using the Genetic 
Algorithm-Based Holt-Winters Method can be applied to other commodity forecasting scenarios. The optimization 
approach can be adapted and extended to enhance short-term forecasting accuracy for various agricultural 
commodities, supporting decision-making and market stability in other sectors In addition,  the methodology describe 
in this paper can be used by using another metaheuristic optimization algorithm or a hybrid approach. Another relevant 
work is the application in other related fields like company stocks, financial and accounting, logistics, manufacturing, 
and other service sectors to validate a multi-disciplinary application of the proposed method.

Abstract 
This report aims to understand the effects of bioplastic degradation by replacing the raw material with 
avocado seed among other fruits and vegetables. One of the main problems affecting the world is pollution 
due to the large amount of solid waste that is discarded daily, in tons, covering all countries, generating an 
excessive accumulation of garbage. Now, going inland, the recycling of solid, organic, and inorganic waste 
is scarce in Peru, therefore, these wastes end up in seas and oceans. Everything explained above happens 
while plastic production remains constant and lucrative in the active business. In the context of the 
contamination and the use that will be granted to avocado seeds, we opted for a methodology of 
bibliographic review in the production of bioplastics based on these seeds that are not usually required for 
a second use. A comparison was made about various articles, like the investigation of bioplastic production 
based on avocado seeds with other organic residues. This comparison will reveal the components that these 
have and are necessary to produce bioplastic. The feasibility of replacing plastic packaging and reducing 
pollution shall be demonstrated from this.

Abstract 
Many new variations of products and ideas have been emerging in the business world lately, especially in the food 
market. One should consider the consumers' purchasing choices, which are influenced by sensory attributes. This 
study ought to assess the influence of consumers' attributes towards the acceptability of a new variation of Chips, 
mainly if it is made from Sea Urchins. Sea urchin is appreciated worldwide for the taste of their gonads. Thus, sensory 
analysis, particularly product characterization, was also used to measure, analyze and interpret the reaction to the 
characteristics of the chips. In terms of product characteristics, under the most favored product treatment, ""taste"" 
appeared as the most essential product attribute of sea urchin chips followed by ""flavor,"" ""texture,"" ""odor,"" and lastly 
""color"". Overall, among the four different treatments used in this study, treatment 2 turned out to be the most favorable.

1. Introduction
Creating a product on the market might present an unusual number of difficulties for business owners. This position 
entails developing a product that can be sold on the market without putting the business in the loss column (Zaichenko 
2021). This study proposes a new variation of chips on the market. Thus, the following are the problems seen by the 
researchers: 1.) The acceptance of this new variation of the product by the target market; 2.) Consumers' evaluation 
and their sensory preference for this new variation. The researchers' desire to investigate the viability or feasibility of 
Sea Urchin Chips is sparked by this notion. This will show off Chips' rebranding with a new variation. 
1.1 Objectives 
This paper aims to assess the sensory preferences and acceptability of Sea Urchin Chips in the market. The respondents 
will then be given a chance to evaluate four different mixtures of Sea Urchin chips and a questionnaire where they 
can put their evaluation of each mixture. This will then help the researchers assess which mixture the consumers prefer 
and what sensory attributes they consider to have affected their evaluation. 
2. Literature Review
Sea Urchin Innovation 
Sea urchins' classification was appreciated worldwide for the taste of its gonads. This species can be commonly located 
underwater and habituated below marine life worldwide. It was highly valued for its caviar-like appearance. The edible 
part is represented by the reproductive system, the gonads, commonly known as pulp or eggs, which are valuable

Figure 5 depicts that Treatment 4 focused on the odor; however, the four other descriptors have been 
associated with coefficients that have a significant negative value.

Table 9 corresponds to the adjusted means for each product characteristic. The blue color corresponds to means 
significantly more significant than the global mean. We can see quickly that treatment 2 is a variable associated with 
taste and flavor characteristics. On the other hand, treatment 4 is a variable associated with flavor and texture 
characteristics, which signifies that the results are lower than the global mean. It can then be assumed that treatment 
2 is the preferred choice among the other descriptors. 
6. Conclusion  
The study assessed the consumers' general acceptability towards sea urchin food chips through sensory evaluation. 
The researchers suggested four (4) recipe formulations that differ in the number of product ingredients. The different 
proposed recipes undergo sensory evaluation in terms of taste, color, texture, flavor, and odor by various potential 
consumers. The experimental technique and procedures were utilized in this study and consisted of experimentation 
concerning variables and quantitative adverbial scoring of different treatments. 
 
Based on the findings and interpretation drawn from the data gathered, the most preferred product formulation of sea 
urchin food chips is treatment two (2), with the highest overall product characteristics ratings. Treatment three (3) 
closely garnered the second most acceptable product treatment, followed by treatment one (1) with ratings above 
general acceptability. Finally, treatment four (4) was obtained below the global mean of all four product attributes 
except for the odor. 
 
According to the survey results, treatment two (2) was the most favored recipe formulation among the four suggested 
recipes. In terms of product characteristics, under the most favored product treatment, ""taste"" appeared as the essential 
product attribute of sea urchin chips, followed by ""flavor,"" ""texture,"" and ""odor,"" with ""color"" being the least 
significant feature. The socio-demographic segmentation of the respondents might have influenced the results. The 
majority of the respondents are young adults (ages 18-24), which mostly goes for practicality and prioritizing taste 
other than other factors. The educational background was also seen to have affected the results since most of the 
respondents are at college level and in high school, indicating that the results gathered are directly from the consumers 
and not from the food experts.

Abstract 
The gas turbine has become an important, widely used, and reliable device in the field of energy generation, transportation, and 
other applications. A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of continuous flow internal combustion engine. 
The main hazard associated with gas turbines is a gas leak and the accumulation of combustible gas in a confined location, 
which has the potential to create an explosion or fire if ignited. Thus, this research paper focuses on reducing gas turbine fire 
& explosion events in order to limit the possibility of a gas leak and flammable gas buildup using advanced control measures. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In the 1940s, the rapid development of gas turbines led to the introduction of a replacement for traditional reciprocating engines. 
Gas turbines are complex energy transformation systems. As with other internal combustion engines, they are comprised of 
hundreds of subsystems and the primary system is the consequence of the subsystems coming together. Due to their high-power 
output, efficiency, and dependability, gas turbines are widely used in industrial applications. Due to the nature of the fuels, they 
use, and the high temperatures and pressures involved in their operation, these devices also pose a significant risk of fire and 
detonation. To ensure the welfare of personnel and the environment, it is essential to comprehend the primary causes of fires 
and explosions at gas turbines. 
This research paper will investigate the primary causes of gas turbine flames and disasters. In order to develop effective 
strategies for preventing accidents and assuring the safe and reliable operation of gas turbines, it is essential to identify the 
fundamental causes of such incidents. The risks associated with gas turbines and the potential consequences of fires and 
explosions will then be discussed. Next, we will examine the primary causes of fires and explosions, such as fuel leakage, 
combustion problems, overheating, apparatus failure, and human error. For each cause, we will investigate the underlying 
mechanisms and provide real-world examples of incidents resulting from that cause. This paper provides a detailed FMEA that 
analysis the potential hazards of fire in gas turbines. Based on the findings, the research paper emphasizes the significance of 
preventing fires and explosions in gas turbines. By emphasizing the importance of routine maintenance, training, and safety 
protocols to reduce the risk of accidents and ensure the safe and dependable operation of gas turbines.

6. Recommendation 
To reduce the risk of fire and detonation at power generation facilities, a systemic strategy and mitigation plan addressing the 
following areas should be developed. 
1. Use Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) in criticality analysis. By combining FTA with FMEA, redundancy can be more 
appropriately and effectively assessed, while also facilitating the examination of human error in the analysis. 
2. Conduct a thorough hazard identification and risk assessment to identify potential sources of fire and detonation 
hazards. This should include an evaluation of the design, equipment, and operational procedures of the power plant to 
determine the probability and severity of prospective incidents. 
3. Implement fire prevention measures to reduce the risk of ignition sources, such as regular inspections and maintenance 
of apparatus, the use of flame-resistant materials, and the implementation of heated work procedures. 
4. Explosion Prevention: To mitigate the potential effects of a fire or explosion, implement explosion prevention 
measures, such as the use of pressure relief devices and explosion suppression systems. 
5. Emergency Response: Create and implement a plan for responding to prospective incidents. This should include 
evacuation procedures, apparatus shutdown, and coordination with local emergency services. 
6. Training and Education: Provide personnel with consistent training and education on fire and detonation hazards, 
preventative measures, and emergency response procedures. 
7. Management of Change: Implement formal management of the change process to ensure that any modifications to the 
design, equipment, or procedures of the power facility are exhaustively evaluated for potential safety risks. 
8. Establish a system of continuous improvement to review and update the risk assessment, prevention measures, 
emergency response plan, and training and education programs on a regular basis. 
By addressing these factors, a systemic strategy and mitigation plan can be devised to reduce the risk of fire and detonation at 
power generation facilities. It is crucial to note that the implementation of this plan should be a continuous process that is 
continuously evaluated and updated to ensure the safety of personnel and the adjacent community. 
 
7. Conclusion 
In conclusion, fires and explosions in gas turbines are significant safety hazards that can have serious consequences, including 
injury, property damage, and loss of life. The main causes of these incidents include fuel leaks, mechanical failures, electrical 
faults, and human error. While these incidents are rare, they can be catastrophic, underscoring the importance of identifying 
and addressing potential hazards to prevent these incidents from occurring. Through our literature review, we have identified 
several best practices for preventing fires and explosions in gas turbines. These include regular maintenance, appropriate safety 
systems, training and procedures, risk assessment, proper combustion, and environmental controls. By implementing these best 
practices, gas turbine operators can reduce the risk of incidents and ensure the safe and reliable operation of these critical pieces 
of equipment. This study utilized the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method, which prioritizes failures based on 
their Risk Priority Number (RPN), to analyze Gas Turbine Power Plants (GTPPS), during the analysis of primary subsystems 
and auxiliary subsystems, a total of 44 distinct failure modes were identified. Out of the identified failure modes, three are 
classified as critical system failures that necessitate the development of a specialized maintenance plan. In summary, while 
fires and explosions in gas turbines are rare occurrences, they have significant safety implications. It is crucial for gas turbine 
operators to be aware of potential hazards and implement appropriate safety measures to prevent these incidents from occurring. 
By doing so, we can ensure the safe and reliable operation of gas turbines and protect workers, property, and the environment 
from the devastating consequences of fires and explosions. Overall, the findings of this research paper underscore the 
importance of gas turbine safety and highlight the need for ongoing efforts to mitigate the risk of fires and explosions in these 
critical pieces of equipment. By taking a comprehensive and proactive approach to safety, gas turbine operators can ensure the 
safe and reliable operation of their equipment, protect workers and the environment, and prevent devastating incidents from 
occurring.

Abstract 
This paper is reviewing the causes and risks of initiating a fire in the spent fuel pool of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) 
and the current capabilities to extinguish or prevent spent fuel fires from occurring to propose new applications 
supporting preventing or mitigating spent fuel fires to ensure the safety of the people, assets, and environment. This 
paper addresses many lessons from the Fukushima Daiichi accident and other research experiments done on spent fuel 
pools. Furthermore, risk assessments such as HAZOP and FTA were developed to come up with recommendations 
and new preventive measures that can be implemented in BNNP and other nuclear power plants around the world.

      Introduction 
These concerns are related to safety & security risks, environmental impacts, and the potential for nuclear weapons 
proliferation. According to IAEA, the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011 are the 
main contributors to public concerns especially when it is related to safety and security risks. These two disasters were 
associated with the release of massive amounts of radioactive materials into the environment, which is eventually 
getting to the food chain or getting directly to the body by exposure to the radioactive materials. For example, according 
to the World Health Organization, more than 4,000 cases of thyroid cancers among children and adults have resulted 
from the Chernobyl accident only by the inhalation of radioactive iodine. Not mentioning the destructive effects on 
the public of the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, according to Nagata in 2019 that the number of people 
affected by the bombs reached up to 140,000 deaths by 1945 and more than the number of the deaths, people have 
been suffering from long-term health issues including cancer.

1057","Conclusion 
Summary 
This paper aims to cover the risk assessment of the spent fuel pool fires and support the need of the country to produce 
energy based on nuclear fuel. As seen in the literature review section, the main function of the spent fuel is to store the 
used fuel and cool it as the fuel will generate decay heat. So, the cooling of the fuel rods is critical to avoid fires or 
explosions and based on the literature review, the failure in cooling the spent fuel pools or the loss of the energy that 
supplies cooling will lead to fire or explosion in the presence of hydrogen gas. This is supported by the Fukushima Daiichi 
incident, where a tsunami led to the loss of energy that led to the loss of cooling and an explosion in unit 4 as hydrogen 
gas was present. This is related to the heating of the used fuel rods covered with Zirconium, a metal that at a certain 
heating range will start ignition. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to find new ways of extinguishing or preventing such 
types of fire in nuclear power plants as spent fuel is necessary in all nuclear power plants. The paper reviews what is 
available in today’s world and suggests modifications or new methods to succeed with the paper's aims. The paper covered 
several assessments starting with Historical analysis, HAZOP, and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Each of these together 
supports finding the major risk in the support of the literature review to avoid spent fuel first. As a result, the paper 
proposes an innovative design of a system that works in case of losing the energy in the spent fuels. This proposal 
includes calculations of the design and its ability to cover and cool the fuel, in addition to a 3D illustration with actual 
diminutions. 
Recommendation and Suggestions 
Based on the findings, we suggest doing further research that includes testing the prototype that has been designed in this 
paper. The testing shall include the durability of holding such weight above the spent fuel pools. In addition, the tests 
shall involve alternative ways of starting the designed tank in case of a total loss of energy. We recommend further risk 
analysis of the design to ensure that the prototype is not adding new risks to the current situation. In addition, both the 
(HAZOP) Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) suggest further points of the spent fuel pool assessment, which can be 
further studied to add another layer of protection by eliminating or substituting a risk that can be avoided with further 
study. Combined with the literature review and the data analysis, the paper suggests a design of a passive source of water 
and cooling supply for the spent fuel pool. This tank is a flying tank, which is also suggested to replace the Boric Acid 
Storage Tank (BAST) as it has a good concentration of Boron acid ranging between 4000-4400 ppm based on “proposed 
technical specification changes related to boron injection tank elimination”. It is recommended to have further study and 
research to understand the dynamic effects of such a choice on other systems. 
Conclusion 
To conclude, the usage of nuclear energy as a source of renewable and clean energy is the trend of countries in the world 
as it produces less CO2 in comparison to traditional fossil fuels. Nuclear energy fuel, like all other sources of energy, 
imposes certain risks, and with the vision to seek less production of CO2 with the growing need for energy, countries shall 
seek cleaner energy with the highest safety measures. The nuclear energy industry had two major accidents that changed 
the way the world sees such sources. However, in this paper, the aim is to learn from earlier experiences and accidents to 
suggest new methods, ways, and designs to prevent one of the major incidents in Fukushima Daiichi, which is the spent 
fuel pool explosion and fire. This paper designed a flying tank with the ability to ensure the cooling of the spent fuel even 
in major shutdowns of energy by any circumstances. The design is a prototype and requires further analysis and testing 
to ensure the suitability of the design in the real world and analysis of what kind of other risks this design could add to 
the spent fuel pool area.

Abstract 
Fire is a primary threat to property and human safety in warehouses, and risk management of warehouse fires is 
challenging due to potential accident causes and various safety measures. Warehouse fires are caused by many factors 
such as the size of the buildings and the amount of stored combustible material. The size of the buildings and the volumes 
of combustible material held result in many of the fires becoming major conflagrations which pose challenges for fire 
and rescue services and result in significant property losses. Storage fires, like those in fuel storage facilities, can quickly 
spread to surrounding products, generate a number of secondary fires, resulting in conditions where accidents are 
uncontrollable, and severely destroy assets. The bowtie analysis approach was used in this paper for the industrial 
warehouse fire scenario. A generalized framework to manage warehouse fires was then developed followed by a general 
mitigation measure to control fires at industrial warehouses. A successful fire safety strategy is a thorough fire risk 
assessment that considers warehouse protection and life safety in compliance with national fire safety legislation. In the 
interests of developing a successful risk control program, an assessment will identify the fire threats and the potential for 
property losses and business interruption losses. The assessment should consider the structure of the building and the 
flammability of the products stored and the mode of storage.

Introduction 
With the 20th century of the ever-growing economy and with the vast rapid global trade, the trends of Goods demands, 
logistics and transportation have witnessed significant increases in a global context. Consequently, storage facilities and 
warehouses have grown in numbers to meet the demand for goods storage across different industries. According to the 
data obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of private warehouses has grown from 15,203 in 2008 to 
18,182 in 2018(Bureau of Labor 2022). Furthermore, it can be also noticed that the sizes of warehouses are also increasing 
as reported in the literature (NFPA na). This increase in both numbers and sizes can be explained by the growing industry 
demand. Generally, warehouses are defined as designated areas to store and handle materials in the most optimal and 
planned way according to the logistics of Bearue (18 et al. 2017). Warehouses are categorized using different approaches 
such as categorization per purpose or by the cargo characteristics. Some examples of warehouse by purpose include 
wholesale, processing, and retail warehouses. The categorization per the

Carbon filters can be used to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other gases from the air. VOCs can be 
released during material handling and processing and can contribute to the accumulation of combustible dust. 
 
Maintenance and Cleaning 
By implementing regular maintenance and cleaning practices, warehouse operators can help reduce the risk of a fire and 
improve the overall safety of the facility. Regular maintenance of equipment, such as material handling equipment and 
electrical systems, can help prevent malfunctions that could lead to a fire. This includes inspecting equipment for wear 
and tear, replacing damaged components, and testing electrical systems to ensure they are functioning properly. Cleaning 
of floors, equipment, and surfaces can help prevent the accumulation of combustible materials, including dust, debris, 
and flammable liquids. This can be done through regular sweeping, mopping, and dusting, as well as the use of dust 
collection systems and air cleaning technologies. 
 
Monitoring and Testing 
Monitoring and testing can have a significant impact on warehouse fire prevention by helping to identify potential hazards 
and ensuring that fire prevention systems and equipment are functioning properly. Regular monitoring of the warehouse 
can help identify potential fire hazards before they become a problem. This can include monitoring equipment for wear 
and tear, identifying potential ignition sources, and checking storage areas for improperly stored flammable materials. 
Moreover, this can help ensure that the warehouse is in compliance with fire safety regulations and standards. This can 
include monitoring compliance with building codes, safety regulations, and industry-specific standards, as well as 
implementing best practices for fire prevention. 
 
Proposed Future work 
The bow tie analysis provides a simplified and robust approach to managing hazards. Limited studies in the literature 
were found on industrial facilities application hence collaborative work on utilizing this powerful technique in fire cases 
from an industry perspective is highly needed to provide a systematic approach and promote safety culture. 
 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, the bow tie analysis approach is a powerful tool that gives a holistic approach to present a hazard 
assessment integrated with anticipated threats and potential consequences with their barriers and safety controls. In this 
study, the bow-tie analysis was used to assess the fire at warehouse scenario followed by a generalized framework that 
provides a systematic approach to fire hazards in warehouses. Finally, a generalized mitigation measure to control fire at 
the warehouse was further discussed. This technique has proved its effectiveness in many applications. Although case 
scenarios of fire are limited in literature, a more optimistic view on using this approach to control fire in industrial 
facilities is proposed.

1. Introduction
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic, commonly known as COVID-19, has impacted people all across the world and 
brought about a number of changes. The economic sectors including manufacturing industries and their supply chains 
have also been touched. The impacts of COVID-19 have been far-reaching and, according to some analysts, they will 
not disappear before the end of 2022. So, the escalating COVID-19 pandemic has heightened global concerns 
regarding the consequences for and restoration of international supply chains. Before this crisis, risk management was 
used to identify and minimize risks that may affect the supply chain's efficiency. The 2008 recession, SARS, the 
Indonesian Tsunami, and the Swine Flu, for example, were all low-probability occurrences risks that had a substantial 
influence on supply chains between 2000 and 2010.  
So nowadays, a risk cannot be neglected especially supply chain risks. In such a highly uncertain business 
environment, practitioners and researchers have put a higher level of attention to supply chain risk management(BCI, 
n.d.). Companies can proactively manage uncertainties that may occur in the future by defining and assessing risks.
And the management of supply chain risks has emerged as an important area of research in the field of supply chain
management. But, according to the ‘Global Risk Report 2020’, Supply Chain Risk Management SCRM present a
significant challenge because of the interconnection between risks and how this may lead to system complexity(World
Economic Forum 2020). For this aim, the rapid rise and frequency of global risks has pushed academics and
researchers to become interested in this topic, thus generating a large amount of literature. The definition provided by
Ho et al. (Ho et al. 2015) present four stages in SCRM: Risk identification, Risk assessment, Risk mitigation, and Risk

Abstract 
In today’s modern world radiation is utilized in medical, industrial and military sectors. X-rays and gamma radiation 
are both forms of electromagnetic radiation commonly used in laboratory settings. X-rays are produced by accelerating 
electrons and directing them onto a target material, while the decay of radioactive isotopes emits gamma radiation. 
Despite the benefits of radiation, prolonged exposure can affect employees and public health. Thus, Pb (lead) shielding 
has been utilized as an effective mitigation strategy for mitigating the health hazards associated with radiation. Due to 
its large atomic number and density, Pb is effective for mitigating x-rays and gamma rays. However, even though lead 
provides protection from radiation it can also affect human health. This research focuses on the effect of the lead pb 
on employees and public health. The study proposes measures and controls to reduce lead associated health hazards.

1. Introduction
Radiation exposure is a growing concern in contemporary society, attributed to its increasing use in medical, industrial, 
and military settings. In the laboratory setting, it is utilized for various purposes, such as material science, medical 
research, and nuclear physics. However, compared to the public, cardiovascular interventional laboratory employees 
such as technicians, physicians, and other workers are exposed to higher radiation levels (Rogers & Brodt  2018). 
Therefore, although the utilization of this approach in the clinical setting is associated with numerous benefits, its 
increased utilization puts clinical staff at risk of harmful radiation exposure. Additionally, although all forms of 
radiation pose significant health hazards to the public, gamma radiation is associated with more adverse outcomes. 
Gamma radiation is one of the physical agents that previous studies have identified as carcinogenic (Basu 2018). 
Despite its effectiveness in sterilization in the clinical context, the exposure of these rays to the patients and the public 
may lead to various alterations in different cells that may cause body damage. The damage linked with gamma-ray 
exposure includes DNA damage, radiation sickness, cell death, and cancer incidence (Ahmed et al. 2020). 
Additionally, this type of gamma radiation is more penetrating than X-rays and can pass through thicker and denser 
materials, leading to reconsidering its use. Furthermore, gamma rays are more prone to ionization due to cobalt-60, a 
primary source of its radioactive isotope, which exposes lab employees to various health hazards. Therefore, gamma 
rays present various health hazards to the public that need to be investigated to formulate potential solutions which

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is concerned with evaluating and assessing the COVID-19 waste management plan to develop a 
generalized waste management framework that can be adopted with future pandemics based on the UAE approach. Some 
existing models for waste management across different countries across the globe and the extent to which they could be 
applied in defined areas are discussed. An integrated framework that can serve as a basis for the development of a waste 
management system is proposed. Applicability, benefits, challenges, and limitations of the system are all outlined with a 
narrower scope focusing on the different approaches adopted by several Emirates in the UAE. An in-depth analysis of the 
current waste management methods, as well as the focus on disposing of medical waste contaminated with COVID-19. A 
comprehensive COVID-19 UAE-based framework is proposed alongside a generalized framework that can be implemented in 
future pandemics that are associated with a pathogen carrier.

1. Introduction
In late 2019, a highly contagious virus spread widely around the globe with an alarming infectious capability, resulting in 
the Coronavirus (SARS- CoV- 2 or COVID-19) pandemic. Since then, several challenges have been raised by the COVID- 
19 Pandemic, in various aspects of social life, economic status, and environmental balance (McNeely 2021). In particular, 
it contributed to an accelerated generation of biological waste. As of 4th November 2022, 628,694,934 confirmed cases of 
COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, with nearly 6,576,088 deaths, according to the World Health Organization 
(W.H.O. 2022). As a response to control the spread, governments and authorities worldwide imposed measures like social 
distancing, usage of personal protective equipment, screening facilities, isolation and caring wards, and vaccination centers. 
An enormous amount of medical waste is believed to have been produced from these activities. However, the quantification 
of the amount of waste produced globally has been a rigorous task, as disparities exist in the manner of production and 
recording. Nevertheless, all reported data unanimously agree with the significant increase in the quantity of waste produced 
since the start of the pandemic and the high risk of infection arising from them if not handled properly. 3.4 kg/bed/day of 
hazardous biomedical waste was found to be generated in a survey of five Asian cities, as per an assessment by the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which is a significant increase from the average quantity of healthcare waste 
produced before 2020, i.e., 0.5 kg/bed/day (U.N.E.P 2022). In another study conducted by Sangkham et al.  it was seen that 
a total of 16,659.48 tons/day of clinical waste was generated in Asia alone (Sangkham 2020). Rajak et al.  illustrated that 
over 32,996 mt of the biomedical waste directly related to COVID-19 was generated in just 6 months- June- December 2020 
(Rajak et al. 2022). South Korea is belied to have produced over 2000 tons of medical waste until May 2020 since the 
pandemic (U.N.E.S.C.A.P 2022) (Ilyas 2020). It is believed that the volume of clinical waste rose by 350–500% due to the 
pandemic leading to challenges in the waste disposal and management capacity of countries around the globe (Fadaei 2021). 
1.1 Objectives 
The objectives of this research are to: 
1.
Identify the current production of biological waste and its types.
2.
Develop a waste management plan for the disposal of different types of identified biological waste during the
pandemic.
3.
Extend the developed waste management plan to accommodate future pandemics.

The first aspect of managerial waste management is the establishment of national guidelines, which act as a critical 
element in helping firms provide efficient waste management. Setting up the guidelines should be done by 
communication, which allows for the development of shared understanding and the elucidation of complex situations. 
Next, facilities are better able to achieve the goals established by the administration with the help of the policies 
implemented. The rules established for the treatment and deployment of biological waste management are included, 
as are periodic revisions of the guidelines to account for changing circumstances on the national and international 
levels (Deepak et al. 2021). The next step is for authorities to permit healthcare facilities to produce, collect, and 
transport biological waste to processing facilities. This paves the way for a structured hierarchy to be set up, with clear 
lines of accountability between various institutions and entities. Finally, a crucial step in the managerial perspective 
of waste management is public awareness. The success of waste management services depends on open lines of 
communication between municipal agencies and their consumers. In order for citizens to make effective use of the 
services that are made accessible to them, it is necessary that they are aware of the services' schedules as well as any 
requirements for access and utilization. Campaigns, informative multimedia presentations, and professional assistance 
and guidance in public areas are all examples of awareness-raising initiatives. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Increased usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), disinfectant wipes, and other healthcare supplies has been 
linked to the pandemic, leading to a rise in the production of a variety of potentially infectious wastes. Therefore, the 
establishment of a strategy for handling solid waste is becoming more pertinent. The comprehensive framework 
developed in this work emphasized the efficient implementation of various waste processing technologies that were 
implemented in response to the COVID issue. It also illustrated the eﬀective management of various types of medical 
solid waste. One pitfall is that the SVM model is more expensive than other technologies as it needs advanced 
computational resources. In spite of the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study addresses waste management 
strategies that can be used to cut down on waste production. Light is also shed on prospective waste management 
scenarios for future pandemics.

Abstract 
A hybrid work environment enables employees to have a combination of working from home and the office. The intention 
of this paper is to investigate and provide a comparison between hybrid work and in-office work environments. As 
researchers indicate, WFH has a positive impact on employee productivity and well-being. In order to provide a deep 
understanding, an empirical survey was conducted on 95 United Emirates workers. The key findings of this survey 
illustrate that WFH has both positive and negative impacts on workers. The participants record positive experiences with 
WFH, including flexibility, increased efficiency, improved work-life balance, and better focus. However, the study 
revealed that some participants recorded various challenges, such as lack of social interaction, increased output 
expectations, and long working hours, which were obstructions to their participation in WFH. The findings from this 
research aid in understanding the benefits and challenges of WFH and inform organizations on the best approach to follow 
when instituting a hybrid work environment within their workforce.

Introduction 
The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of the year 2020 compelled many businesses around the 
globe to implement remote work policies to comply with social distancing guidelines and ensure the safety of their 
employees. This abrupt transition to remote work highlighted the significance of speedy technology and digital 
connectivity in contemporary workplaces. As a result, numerous businesses have accelerated their digital transformation 
initiatives by investing in technologies that facilitate remote collaboration and communication. However, after more than 
a year of remote work, many organizations are investigating a hybrid work system that incorporates remote work with 
office-based work. This new way of working provides employees with greater

to ensure a diverse representation of gender, socioeconomic status, cognitive abilities, and perceptions. Participants 
were recruited through (include mode of recruitment). Prior to the conduction of the survey selected respondents were 
informed of the aim of the research and consent was acquired before they were allowed to respond to the survey. The 
data collected from these participants was analyzed using graphs, percentages, and tables. Additionally, the bow-tie 
diagram was utilized to analyze results for a coherent discussion of these research outcomes. 
 
Recommendation 
In a hybrid work system, the following suggestions and ergonomics techniques are recommended to boost worker 
output and wellbeing: 
1. Create a dedicated workspace in your house, away from your personal living spaces, ideally with an 
ergonomic desk and chair. 
2. Encourage workers to take periodic breaks during the workday to stretch, go for a stroll, or do other physical 
activities. 
3. To lessen the chance of pain or harm, give workers access to ergonomic tools like adjustable desks, chairs, 
and keyboards. 
4. To assist staff in balancing their job and personal lives, think about implementing flexible schedules or giving 
them more freedom during working hours. 
5. To promote a sense of community and prevent feelings of isolation, encourage open communication and 
cooperation between team members who work remotely and those who work in an office. 
6. Encourage regular social interactions between coworkers by hosting in-person or online meetings, as 
appropriate. 
7. Provide tools for managing tension and maintaining mental health for workers, such as access to counseling 
services or wellness initiatives. 
8. Inform staff members of the value of good posture, frequent breaks, and avoiding prolonged standing or 
sitting. 
9. Consider giving staff members a budget or stipend for home office supplies or other resources to support 
their comfort and efficiency. 
10. Conduct regular evaluations of staff productivity and well-being to spot problem areas and modify practices 
and policies, as necessary. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Recently, the world experienced a situation where they had to find another way to work within their houses. Businesses 
were closed for weeks until they prepared applications to overcome the loss and continue their productivity. Working 
from home was the only solution at that time and many facilities were capable of performing their daily tasks gradually till 
the end of the pandemic. The results of working from home were surprising as many businesses developed financially, 
in addition to increased employee productivity and satisfaction level. Nowadays, some facilities offer a hybrid work 
environment strategy, as it provides more flexibility, and increases employee performance and well-being. In addition, 
employees experience fewer distractions and stress-triggering factors in a hybrid work environment. This study suggested 
several methods to enhance employee well-being for UAE employees. The results showed that working from home does 
not differ from the office work environment, considering their task load and work shifts. In fact, 58% agreed that they 
perform better with higher productivity than in the office work environment due to the absence of interruptions and other 
office distractions by 84%. Although communication among work colleagues was lower, 95% of the participants 
preferred working from home as they benefit from transportation time and organize their breaks with lower management 
supervision. To conclude, a Hybrid work environment offers many benefits for employees and employers as work can 
be continued and tasks can be performed while workers are enjoying their cups of coffee inside their homes.

Abstract 
Stress has been considered a major negative impact on employees worldwide. The present century is known as the stress 
era since human life is full of stress and strain. Workers know how their anxiety and stress levels impact their capacity for 
productivity. The main reason for stress presence is the complexity of the human personal, social, and ecological 
environment, and simultaneously interactions of humans with its surrounding. In terms of psychological sciences, stress is 
a feeling of mental tension. Low levels of stress are more desirable, and even healthy, and facilitate human performance. 
However, high levels of stress result in social, psychological, biological problems, and serious harm to people. This project 
shows innumerable studies in this field investigated the role of different related factors of stress and aimed to aggregate 
various dimensions of theoretical issues and influences of stress in human everyday life especially in work. Also, this 
project introduces multiple devices for stress measurement and how they are conducted to employees in order to measure 
their stress levels. A conducted survey done with 30 engineers working at NPCC, the results have shown different levels 
of stress on conducted employees. However, the present study was an effort to make a theoretical unity of different 
measurement devices. According to the obtained results and data, stress can’t be investigated and observed via a single 
study, therefore, incorporation is much needed by psychologists to analyze and develop future frameworks for minimizing 
and controlling work-related stress.

Introduction 
People may experience work-related stress as a reaction to pressures and demands incompatible with their skills and 
knowledge. Although stress can arise under various work conditions, it is frequently exacerbated when staff members feel 
they have little support from managers and coworkers and little influence over work procedures (Ahn et al. 2021). Stress and 
pressure are frequently confused, which is sometimes used to justify poor management techniques. Because of the 
requirements of the modern work environment, pressure on the job cannot be avoided. Depending on the resources available 
and the individual's traits, the pressure deemed acceptable by the individual may even keep employees awake, able to work, 
engaged, and able to learn. On the other hand, stress results when that pressure becomes excessive or uncontrollable. 
Employee health and company performance can both be critically impacted by stress. 
A job enhances a person's health and outlook in numerous ways. Unfortunately, many people experience such high- stress 
levels at work that it surpasses any potential advantages and even endangers their health. Job stress results when the job 
demands do not meet a worker's abilities, resources, or needs. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health in the United States, stress at work can also result in ill health and even harm (Akkoç et al. 2021). Many 
employees report feeling stressed at work, negatively affecting their performance and health. Stress levels differ between 
occupations and demographic groupings. Stress is more likely to affect some workers than others. According to studies, 
those in lower-skilled jobs, women, and younger workers are most at risk of developing complications from workplace 
stress. 
Circumstances that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous, or foreign, or that involve conflict, loss, or 
performance expectations are prone to induce stress. Recurring problems like family obligations, job insecurity, lengthy 
commutes, and time-sensitive events like the pressure of exams or work deadlines can bring stress. Personal traits like these 
facilitate coping with stress and expectations at work. Time management, assertiveness, and problem-solving are a few 
examples. Moreover, favorable workplace conditions and social support contribute to people's happiness. Investments in

professions and businesses and is available in numerous languages. The WSS is a simple procedure and presents easy-
to-use tools. It presents a short and straightforward questionnaire for participants and researchers to assess and analyze 
the study results. The WSS also thoroughly evaluates the individual's stress levels and work-related stressors. Thus, 
it helps identify areas that require intervention. The WSS's emphasis on occupational stress as a multidimensional 
phenomenon is one of its main strengths. In order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the origins of 
stress in the workplace, the questionnaire examines a variety of stressors, such as workload, interpersonal problems, 
and job security. 
5. Conclusion
Stress at work has a complicated relationship with human error, memory loss, and decision-making. It can have a 
detrimental influence on a person's capacity to carry out activities and make judgments. High amounts of stress can affect 
cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, and decision-making, which increase the likelihood of mistakes and errors. 
When someone is under stress, they could be more prone to neglect crucial information, make mistakes, or forget vital data, 
resulting in mistakes and failures. Stress from the workplace also affects one's ability to make decisions. When under stress, 
a person could be more inclined to act quickly or rely on inaccurate information than to take the time to properly weigh all 
of their options and decide what to do. Human memory impairment can also have an impact on judgment. A person may 
be more prone to make the same mistakes in the future if they have previously failed or made blunders, especially if they 
are stressed out or under pressure to achieve. Overall, work-related stress, human error, memory loss, and poor decision-
making are all connected and can significantly influence productivity and job performance. It is crucial for people and 
organizations to be aware of how stress may affect these variables and to take actions to control stress levels and reduce 
the likelihood of mistakes and failures.

Abstract 
Resource requirements is the basic building block of capacity planning and a principal concern in the design of 
production/manufacturing system. Similar factors govern resource requirements and material flows. In particular, 
quality factors and the configuration of the quality assurance – the inspections' system. In IEOM 2021, the 
dependencies of material flows on quality and the configuration of the inspection system have been discussed and 
resource requirements have been marked for future consideration. Now it is their turn. Despite the intensive effort 
devoted to this subject, only recently have the dependencies of resource requirements on quality levels and the 
configuration of the inspections' system been modeled correctly. The quality levels, the configuration of the 
inspections' system, and inspection error rates significantly affect production volumes and the consequent resource 
requirements. Due to the compensation principle volume and hence resource requirements are inversely related to 
the quality level - increase with the defect rates. Inspections aid by removing defect units – decrease the volumes. 
Unfortunately, inspections are imperfect and conforming units are also removed due to inspection errors. These 
units, too, require compensations. Besides, Inspections incur costs, additional to other production costs. 
Consequently, the configuration of the inspections' system becomes an issue. These effects are demonstrated, 
examined and discussed in this talk.

A Novel Integer Programming Model for the Fixture 
Schedule of Turkish Professional Soccer League

Associate Professor of Industrial Engineering

Abstract 
We study a sports scheduling problem where the entire fixture of a soccer season in Turkey must be scheduled by 
taking into account a variety of constraints. We model the problem as an integer program; because of the computational 
intractability, we develop a heuristic algorithm for obtaining a suboptimal solution. Differing from the earlier models, 
our model minimizes the assignment of matches where a team plays against strong teams consecutively. We compare 
the performance of our heuristic against the existing solution and demonstrate numerically that our heuristic performs 
significantly better than the current solution. 
Keywords 
OR in sports, sports scheduling, integer programming, scheduling, operations research 
1. Introduction
The problem of scheduling a fixture is highly complex problem since it requires the assignment of matches for each 
round, which leads to computational intractability. Researchers therefore resort to heuristic algorithms by exploiting 
certain features of these problems. Certainly, depending on the nature of the respective problem, a variety of heuristic 
procedures can be developed.  
In any given fixture, it is almost impossible to avoid the following situations: a team having to play two consecutive 
matches against relatively strong teams. This situation certainly should be avoided, as it causes a serious disadvantage 
to the respective team. Motivated by this fact, we develop a mathematical model where the number of two consecutive 
matches against strong teams are minimized for every team. To be more specific, we classify teams as strong, medium, 
and weak based on the past data of their rankings and input them into our model. In this sense, to the best of our 
knowledge, our model is the first one that takes into account such undesirable situations in determining the league 
fixture.   
Our mathematical model is still intractable, since it is developed for obtaining the entire schedule. We therefore 
implement an easy-to-use heuristic procedure for acquiring a suboptimal solution. Our heuristic solves the problem in 
a few steps, first focusing on a number of rounds, then certain rounds of the remaining ones, etc. In a sense, it partitions 
the entire fixture into a few sections and then optimally solves each of them, thereby providing a suboptimal solution 
at the end. We compare our heuristic against the existing schedule and show that it significantly outperforms the 
existing one. For example, percentage improvement in terms of cost is around 44%. 
The flow of our paper is as follows. We first discuss the related literature in Section 2. Section 3 provides necessary 
info about the underlying scheduling problem as well as our mathematical model. In Section 4, we describe the 
experimental design and report numerical results. Section 5 consists of concluding remarks. 
2. Literature Review
Sports scheduling is among operations research fields that have been studied extensively. One can review the 
following survey papers in order to have basic info about the field: Rasmussen and Trick (2008), Ribeiro (2012), and 
Kendal et al. (2010). One classification of the related papers can be based on the objective function used. Examples 
of objective functions used in the respective studies are as follows. Minimizing rest mismatches (Atan and Cavdaroglu

T5. Conclusion 
The problem of scheduling the fixture is computationally intractable in terms of optimality objective. In this research, 
we tackle the fixture schedule problem for Turkish professional soccer league by using the notion of strength criteria 
and utilizing an easy-to-use heuristic procedure. Particularly, the idea that teams can be classified based on their 
strength enables us to have a mathematical model for obtaining a near-optimal solution.  
 
Our numerical results are promising, showing the strength of our heuristic algorithm as compared to the current 
solution. This implies that such a heuristic based on a simplified mathematical model can be used for obtaining a better 
solution in terms of strength criterion.  
 
We are of the view that computational intractability of fixture schedule problems may be addressed through a 
variety of criteria that are similar to the strength criterion we proposed. In that case, it would be interesting to 
observe how distinct heuristic algorithms perform if multiple types of criteria are considered.

Abstract 
Every nation aspires to have a capable national defense that is backed by a robust national defense industry. One of 
the most important expectations is that the defense industry, like every other sector, should make maximum use of 
technology for establishing an independent national defense. 3D printing as an emerging technology is widely used in 
many sectors including mari-time, aerospace, and automotive. It should come as no surprise then, that it is also being 
increasingly adopted by the defense sector worldwide. This study focuses on the effects of 3D printing technology on 
Türkiye’s defense in-dustry. For this purpose, a three-stage methodology was followed. In the first stage, the positive 
and negative effects of 3D printers on the defense indus-try were determined via literature. In the second stage, the 
SWOT analysis of Türkiye's defense industry was examined. In the last stage, the effects of 3D printers on the outputs 
obtained at the end of SWOT were carried out. The opinions needed during the study were obtained from defense 
industry companies in Türkiye and academicians working in this field. 
Keywords 
Defense Industry, 3D Printing, SWOT. 
1. Introduction
3D printers, a technology that the defense industry has been actively using for a while, are becoming more and more 
practical and economical. Although it is preferred primarily in prototype production for now, it is certain that this 
technology will move to an important position in spare parts or direct production in the near future. 3D printers have 
the potential to reduce production costs and allow simple parts to be produced quickly. It can make supply chains safer 
and more cost-effective and contribute to the acceleration of production. 3D printers are a technology that allows a 
defective piece of equipment to be produced without affecting the entire production line. 
In order to observe the effects of 3D printers on the defense industry, SWOT analysis is required. With SWOT 
Analysis, it is aimed to create a plan and strategy for the future as a result of a detailed comparison of strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities and threats. It is necessary to prioritize the items obtained in the SWOT analysis.  
2. Literature Review
The main areas of use of additive manufacturing technology in aerospace and defense are to shorten the design and 
manufacturing process, accelerate the time to market, increase productivity, reduce costs, and provide cost advantages 
in low-volume production. In light of this information, instead of the existing technology in the aerospace and defense 
industry, metal parts manufacturing with the AM method comes to the fore. In the study called Metal Part Production 
with Additive Manufacturing for Aerospace and Defense Industry, the current state of additive manufacturing 
technology in the aerospace sector has been examined (Ozsoy et al. 2019). 
Possibilities and limitations of titanium alloy additive manufacturing; the latest state of an important rapidly 
developing additive manufacturing technology is reviewed. The article discusses the benefits and limitations of the 
Medical and Aerospace applications of Additive Manufacturing from Ti alloys. The study also shows and compares 
the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V samples produced with different technologies (Agapovichev et al.  2018).

3D Technology on Defense Industry 
 
Positive effects: 
 
• 
Rapid prototyping and manufacturing: 3D printers can quickly prototype complex parts and go into mass 
production. This saves time and cost for the development and testing of new weapon systems in the defense 
industry. 
 
• 
Flexibility and customization: 3D printers provide great flexibility in the design and manufacture of parts. 
This facilitates the production of parts suitable for special needs and different platforms in the defense 
industry. Customized parts can improve performance and make military systems more effective. 
 
• 
Logistic advantages: 3D printers enable the production of parts even in remote locations such as military 
bases and operational zones. This can reduce dependency in the supply chain and have a positive impact on 
logistics costs and times. 
 
Negative effects: 
 
• 
Security risks: 3D printers allow sensitive military parts to be copied and used for malicious purposes. This 
can threaten the security of military systems and eliminate strategic advantages due to duplication risks. 
 
• 
Quality and reliability issues: 3D printers may have some limitations in material and workmanship quality 
compared to traditional manufacturing methods. Therefore, there may be concerns about the reliability and 
durability of manufactured parts. Malfunctions or faulty parts in military systems can have serious 
consequences. 
 
• 
Technology limitations: Current 3D printing technologies can make it difficult or impossible to manufacture 
some large and complex parts. Traditional methods may still be needed for the production of some large-
scale systems used in the defense industry. 
 
4. Results and Discussion  
While 3D printers offer opportunities to strengthen the SWOT analysis of the Turkish defense industry, they can also 
bring weaknesses and threats. 3D printers can speed up processes and reduce costs in the defense industry by offering 
rapid prototyping and production. This could increase Turkey's potential to complete defense industry projects on time 
and gain competitive advantage. 3D printers can be used to localize parts production and strengthen the domestic 
supply chain. It provides an opportunity to reduce foreign dependency by increasing the locality rate in Turkey's 
defense industry. 3D printers can potentially pose security risks. The production of sensitive military parts or weapons 
using 3D printers can pose challenges in technology and information security. Turkey needs to manage these threats 
and improve safeguards. 
 
5. Conclusion  
There are reasons for the rapid popularization of additive manufacturing tech-nologies in the defense industry. With 
a 3D printer, the problems posed by the supply chain are largely solved. With additive manufacturing, products can 
be personalized according to needs. In this way, weapons and vehicles that do not produce spare parts can remain in 
service longer, and long and costly processes such as designing UAVs according to mission characteristics can be 
eliminated. Especially in cross-border operations, carrying inventory brings along logistics problems. Additive 
manufacturing technologies allow the dimensions and weight of the transported material to be significantly reduced 
in this area, and enable solutions that were not possible before. In order to analyze these effects of 3D printers on the 
defense industry and more, SWOT analysis has been made. SWOT analysis is a strategic technique used to determine 
the strengths and weaknesses of the effects, and to determine the opportunities and threats arising from the internal 
and external environment. After this study, analyzes can be made using different multi-criteria decision making 
methods.

Abstract 
In daily life decisions, decision-makers may need to consider more than one factor to choose among decision 
alternatives. To support decision making in such problems, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods are 
widely utilized. Some cases of MCDM problems require consideration of interactions between criteria and the 
Analytic Network Process (ANP) method proposed by Saaty and considered the most appropriate method for these 
cases. However, some challenges may be faced in the determination of criteria in ANP applications, and the Benefits, 
Opportunities, Costs, and Risks (BOCR) method is suggested as a possible solution to these challenges, especially in 
decisions where no similar applications were made before. Evaluation of the effects on the technology-based strategic 
targets of the country of a scientific research program in view of social factors is an example of such a decision. Since 
the study is about this decision, an evaluation model based on BOCR-ANP is proposed in the study to measure the 
contribution of a research program in Türkiye to the development of additive manufacturing technologies in the 
aviation and space industry. Possible social effect factors were determined by the review of proposed indicators in 
several studies and consulting expert opinions. Feelings of program stakeholders and external experts on the additive 
manufacturing applications in aviation and space industry were collected, and the contribution of the program on the 
national targets was analysed. The results of the study can help the policymakers to understand the situation in the 
country in this technology area.

Abstract 
Since the advent of the industrial revolution, innovation, and the efficiencies it provides, drives economic growth. 
From Industry 1.0-4.0, new technology deprecates the previous industry paradigm resulting in increases in production 
capacity; however, the economic correlate of efficiency to production capacity has driven economic performance at 
the expense of the environment. From the internal combustion engine to light bulbs to desktop PCs to the Internet, 
technological innovation consumes more energy as gains in efficiency are spent on increases in energy demands to 
higher demand. This ‘Jevons paradox’ characterises capitalism and the free market throughout the modern industrial 
age; there are few, if any, popular technologies, which, through their widespread adoption, result in synergistic and 
sustainable economic and environmental performance. Even so-called ‘sustainable’ technology, e.g., EVs, calculate 
the contribution to CE based on an economic / environmental ‘balance’. To tip this balance in favour of the 
environment is the key to closing the CE loop; blockchain represents a feasible solution, but only if it is implemented 
broadly and deeply across the global SC in production and end of life extension. This paper conducts a thought 
experiment of BC implementation utilising information cascade as an accelerant to global BC adoption toward CE.

1. Introduction
Extant literature indicates that the implementation of blockchain (BC) 4.0 (the application of distributed ledger 
technology to manufacturing and supply chain) represents a transition opportunity for achieving a circular, and 
consequently, a more environmentally sustainable, supply chain (Kouhizadeh et al. 2019; Böckel et al. 2021; Khan et 
al. 2022). This is due to the capability of BC’s distributed ledger to ensure high-quality data, transactional knowledge, 
learning, and outcomes (Vogel et al. 2019; Leng et al. 2020; Park and Li 2021; Javaid et al. 2021; Jeon et al. 2022); 
the benefits can be applied to both economic and environmental ends (Khan et al. 2021; Khan et al. 2022; Kouhizadeh 
2022). The objective of this paper is to examine the potential for BC to achieve both economic and environmental 
performance, but only when the two are co-implemented; as with all previous disruptive industry technologies, BC is 
not immune to the Jevons Paradox, i.e. efficiency gains in industrial practice are directed toward more production 
such that the corresponding increase offsets and surpasses any inherent environmental benefits per unit of production 
(Giamietro and Mayumi 2018; Howson 2021; Yu et al. 2022) . A formula is developed and tested in a best-case and 
worst-case scenario in BC’s implementation in Industry 4.0. The hypothesis of this paper is that information cascade, 
i.e. ‘herd behaviour’, has a negative mediating effect on the environmental performance of BC due to its triggering of
negative externalities associated with game theory.
In contradistinction to the Jevons Paradox, an environmental ‘Kuznet’s Curve’ occurs when efficiencies in production 
over time are enough to reduce the overall environmental impact (Wei 2015; Koilo et al. 2019). As BC evolves from 
3.0 to 4.0 (BC evolution is summarized in Table 4. below), the quantity and quality of its implementation in Industry 
4.0 will determine its support of CE, as the gains from efficiencies support either a Kuznet’s Curve or a Jevons

Abstract 
ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 are widely accepted international standards worldwide for continual improvement in terms 
of quality and environmental impact respectively. This study aims to predict the diffusion of ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 
certifications in Bangladesh from 2022 to 2030. Auto‐Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) approach has 
been applied to choose the best fit model. The ISO survey of certifications was considered as main source of data. 
From the analysis, it is observed that, ARIMA (1, 0, 1) and ARIMA (2,1,0) are the best fitted models for ISO 9001 
and ISO 14001 respectively in predicting the certification in Bangladesh. The forecasted number of certification for 
the year 2030 is obtained as 833 for ISO 9001 and 494 for ISO 14001 in Bangladesh. The finding of the study 
concludes wide scope of diffusion in future. This study will contribute to enrich existing literature and guide policy 
makers in policy formulation. This study will also encourage researchers for further analysis in different context.

1. Introduction
Sustainable management practice is a modern concept in businesses. It plays a vital role in mitigating risks for stable 
economy. Sustainable business practice optimizes the business strategy focusing on environmental and social 
responsibility, customer and stakeholder demand as well as long term economic prosperity. Consequently, 
organizations are now integrating sustainable management practices into their core business strategy to ensure the 
expectations of customers and other stakeholders. ISO standards serve as strong basis for business sustainability to 
reduce barriers of international trade by obeying national and international regulations. Moreover, ISO standards 
promote methodical management, continuous performance improvement, factual decision-making, and beneficial 
supplier relationships. Additionally, the application of ISO standards can be an instrument of marketing (Ehsan 2010). 
Due to global competition and complex supply chain, customers and stakeholders are concerned about quality of 
products and services with environmental sustainability. ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards have achieved global 
acceptance for continuous improvement in terms of ensuring quality and environmental aspects respectively 
(Franceschini et al. 2008) (Casadesus et al. 2010) (Marimon et al. 2010). Furthermore, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 also 
contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Smith 2022) (ISO 9001:2015, 2021) (ISO 
14001:2015, 2022), which is reflected in Table 1.

From Table 1. It is evident that a single ISO standard contributes to multiple goals of the SDGs. As a result, 
organizations are increasingly adopting internationally recognized standards (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001) to improve 
their business processes and demonstrate their commitment to quality and corporate sustainability (Ferreira et al. 2019) 
(Marimon et al. 2009). Bangladesh's economic growth (GDP) is significantly impacted by international trade like 
exports and imports, with a strong positive correlation (Ahamad 2016). Due to global competition, stakeholder’s

6. Conclusion 
Sustainable business practice has become a matter of concern nowadays since the resources are limited and the 
competition is high. The main focus of the study is to predict the diffusion of ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 in upcoming 
years. The ARIMA model has been applied to choose the best fit models. The findings conclude that the diffusion of 
ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards is expected to have a positive growth of adoption in future. This study will enhance 
the existing literature by proposing ARIMA model for diffusion analysis of ISO standards and help stakeholders in 
decision making. This study will create scope for the researchers to employ ARIMA models in analyzing the diffusion 
of other ISO standards. The study will also guide the professionals in formulating sustainable business policy for 
continual improvement.

Abstract 
This study focuses on analyzing customer load profiles and their impact on the electric distribution grid in the context 
of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. With the increasing number of Filipinos working from home, energy 
consumption has surged, making it crucial for electric distribution companies to classify customer profiles based on 
energy usage. In this paper, we collected residential data from a Philippine electric distribution company during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The objective is to employ clustering methods, particularly the K-means algorithm, to group 
customer profiles and determine the optimal number of clusters using the multi-criteria model and elbow method. All 
simulation were performed using MATLAB platform. This study provides valuable insights for electric distribution 
companies in managing customer load profiles and optimizing the distribution grid amidst the pandemic.

1. Introduction
Electric distribution companies in the Philippines play a critical role in providing reliable and efficient electricity 
services to consumers. To optimize operations and ensure grid stability, these companies are keenly interested in 
analyzing customer load profiles. Understanding the energy consumption patterns of customers and classifying them 
into distinct categories allows for better demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid management strategies. 
However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges and uncertainties, significantly 
impacting the energy consumption landscape and requiring a reevaluation of customer load profiles. 
A customer load profile refers to a comprehensive representation of the energy consumption patterns exhibited by 
individual customers over a specific period. It provides valuable insights into the variations in energy usage throughout 
the day, week, month, or year. Load profiles are essential tools in energy management, demand response programs, 
load forecasting, and overall grid optimization. By analyzing customer load profiles, utilities, grid operators, and 
energy service providers can gain a deeper understanding of consumption patterns, identify energy-saving 
opportunities, and make informed decisions about energy generation, distribution, and pricing strategies, (Yang et al. 
2018) 
Customer load profiles are typically constructed using interval metering data, which records the energy consumption 
at regular intervals, such as every 15 minutes or every hour. These data points capture the dynamic nature of energy 
usage, allowing for a granular analysis of consumption patterns. Load profiles can reveal valuable information about

5. Conclusion 
This paper focuses on the clustering of customers' electricity load profiles using the K-means algorithm. A dataset of 
approximately 1 million customers was collected from a distribution company in the Philippines. The study utilized 
the Multi-Criteria Model and Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, resulting in 2 and 7 clusters, 
respectively. 
 
The Multi-Criteria Model revealed two distinct peaks in the load profiles: Cluster 1 exhibited higher activity in the 
morning (8am) and afternoon (5pm), while Cluster 2 showed higher activity in the morning (8am) and evening (12mn). 
On the other hand, the Elbow Method identified 7 clusters, with Clusters 1-5 demonstrating similar consumption 
patterns with higher activity at nighttime (8pm-1am) and lower consumption during the afternoon (12nn-4pm and 
6pm-7pm). Clusters 6-7 exhibited relatively flat consumption patterns. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on customer load profiles. The analysis of load profiles during 
the pandemic period revealed shifts in consumption patterns and changes in overall energy demand. These changes 
can be attributed to various factors such as remote work arrangements, lifestyle adjustments, and shifts in commercial 
activities. In addition, the pandemic highlighted the importance of adapting load profile clustering techniques to 
capture and analyze the evolving consumption patterns during exceptional circumstances. Electric distribution 
companies should consider incorporating temporal and contextual factors into their clustering models to accurately 
reflect the changes in customer behavior during such events. Moreover, The study underscores the importance of 
building resilience and flexibility into the electric grid infrastructure. Understanding the changes in load profiles can 
help companies better anticipate and manage shifts in energy demand. This can inform decisions related to capacity 
planning, network upgrades, and resource allocation to ensure reliable and efficient energy supply during challenging 
times. Finally, the pandemic serves as a learning opportunity for electric distribution companies to enhance their 
preparedness for future crises or disruptive events. By leveraging advanced clustering algorithms, real-time data 
analytics, and scenario modeling, companies can develop strategies to mitigate the impact of similar situations in the 
future, ensuring the resilience and reliability of the energy system. These findings provide valuable insights for electric 
distribution companies, enabling them to establish rules and strategies related to demand response, network planning, 
and load forecasting. 
 
For future research, it is recommended to explore the combination of the K-means algorithm with Dynamic Time 
Warping (DTW) for analyzing customer load profiles in time series data. Additionally, incorporating meta-heuristic 
optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) could enhance the K-means algorithm's ability to determine 
the optimal number of clusters.

Abstract 
The application of supply chain risk management has a positive impact in the form of a competitive advantage for 
companies in facing business competition. Integrating aspects of supply chain sustainability in analyzing supply chain 
risks, especially agricultural products that are perishable, bulky, and of various qualities can provide an optimal supply 
chain. This results in increased time requirements, demand uncertainty and supply chain complexity. The problems 
the company is currently experiencing are the availability of raw materials, the quality of raw materials that is still 
inadequate and prices that continue to rise. This research can provide information related to supply chain risk 
management literature, especially on agricultural products and risk mitigation that must be carried out so that it can 
provide an overview of the limitations of supply chain risk management research on agricultural products in 
companies.

Introduction 
The industry’s competition requires a study of its competitive advantage. Industry needs to have competitive priorities, 
including cost leadership, quality, responsiveness, and flexibility, to achieve this advantage. For this reason, it is 
necessary to optimize the entire supply chain network or in other words integrate the supply chain or supply chain 
management. Based on some literature supply chain management is planning, designing, and controlling the flow of 
goods, information, and money along the supply chain to efficiently meet customer needs both now and in the future. 
The function of supply chain management is to coordinate the flow of goods, information, and money between all 
companies related to the supply of goods, manufacturing companies that process the goods supplied, distributor 
companies, and retail companies.  
When determining a supply chain system, it is necessary to make the right decisions for the sustainability of a 
company. In decision theory, risk is defined as the variation in the distribution of possible outcomes, their probability, 
and their subjective value (March and Shapira 1987). This definition also includes probabilities, i.e. positive 
deviations. Harland, Brencheley, and Walker (2003) define risk as the chance of damage, loss, injury, or other 
undesirable consequences. Many authors define risk as the probability of a particular event multiplied by its severity 
in terms of negative business impact (Christopher and Peck 2004)

4. Conclusion 
Through the presentation in this paper, we get an adequate initial overview of the supply chain risk management 
literature review on agricultural raw materials. Through this paper, there is also a research gap which becomes an 
opportunity for further research. This exploratory study was carried out by mapping previous literature on two topics, 
namely supply chain risk management for agricultural raw materials and prevention strategies to minimize risks for 
the company. Research in this field will be further developed by considering several factors that have not been 
explored in this paper regarding the effectiveness of implementing alternative mitigations.

Abstract 
This study aims to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) 
strategy in the Philippine stock market over a 12-year period. The MACD strategy is a widely used technical analysis 
tool that helps identify potential buy and sell signals based on the convergence and divergence of moving averages. 
By examining the historical performance of the Philippine stock market, this review provides insights into the 
profitability and reliability of the MACD strategy as an investment approach. The findings of this study contribute to 
the understanding of the MACD strategy's suitability for investors in the Philippine stock market and inform 
investment decisions based on its long-term performance.

1. Introduction
The Philippine stock market, also known as the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), plays a significant role in the 
country's financial landscape and serves as a crucial avenue for capital formation and investment. Established in 1927, 
the PSE has evolved into a vibrant marketplace where investors can buy and sell shares of publicly listed companies, 
providing an avenue for wealth creation and economic growth. 
The Philippine stock market operates as a centralized exchange, facilitating the trading of equities, bonds, and other 
financial instruments. It serves as a platform for companies to raise capital by issuing shares to the investing public, 
enabling them to finance business expansion, infrastructure projects, and other strategic initiatives. Furthermore, the 
stock market offers individuals and institutional investor’s opportunities to participate in the growth potential of the 
Philippine economy, while providing a regulated and transparent environment for trading activities. It is governed by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and operates under the supervision of the PSE. The market is 
segmented into various sectors, including banking, telecommunications, real estate, consumer goods, and 
manufacturing, representing a diverse range of industries. Market participants, including individual investors, 
institutional investors, and foreign investors, contribute to the liquidity and efficiency of the market, shaping the 
dynamics of stock price movements and trading volumes. 
Over the years, the Philippine stock market has experienced periods of volatility, driven by both domestic and global 
factors. Economic indicators, political developments, investor sentiment, and external shocks can all influence the

The result shows that MACD (4,22,3) provide promising results compared to the classical MACD (12,26,9). This also 
shows that shorter window has more transactions (buying/selling) compared to longer window, it yielded best results. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The MACD strategy, using the traditional settings of (12,26,9) window has demonstrated a positive performance over 
the 12-year period analyzed. The strategy's ability to generate profitable trades and capture favorable market 
movements suggests its potential value as a technical analysis tool for investors in the Philippine stock market. 
 
The new window settings of MACD, (4, 22,3), have shown promising results in terms of performance and profitability. 
The alternative window lengths may provide traders with additional insights and trading opportunities, offering an 
alternative approach to utilizing the MACD indicator in the Philippine stock market. 
 
The MACD strategy, regardless of the specific settings used, appears to be particularly effective in capturing bullish 
trends and identifying potential buying opportunities. The strategy's ability to generate bullish crossovers and signal 
upward price movements can be valuable for investors seeking to capitalize on positive market conditions. 
 
Risk management is a crucial aspect of successful trading, and the MACD strategy can contribute to risk mitigation. 
By incorporating MACD-based signals, traders can potentially identify potential trend reversals, divergence patterns, 
or bearish crossovers, allowing for timely exits or risk management measures to protect against potential losses.

The findings of this study provide valuable insights for investors and traders in the Philippine stock market, enabling 
them to make informed decisions based on the historical performance and characteristics of the MACD strategy. 
However, it is essential to consider that past performance is not indicative of future results, and market conditions 
may evolve over time, requiring ongoing evaluation and adaptation of trading strategies.

Abstract 
The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the primary technologies of Industry 4.0. It is widely regarded as an essential 
infrastructure for enhancing the transparency of business processes and the accuracy of business decisions. Despite 
the popularity and applicability of IoT across industries, there is little understanding of IoT adoption factors in the 
Freight Transport and Logistics Industry (FTLI). This study investigates the factors for the adoption of IoT in the 
FTLI. The factors are identified and classified based on the Technology-Organization-Environmental framework and 
prioritized the factors using Fuzzy Analytic Network Process. The relative and dependency weights of each dimension 
and factor within each dimension have been determined, and it has been found that technology is the most prioritized 
dimension. Further, Competitive Advantage, Management Support, Security and Privacy, Technology Readiness and 
Capabilities, and Government Policy and Support are the most prioritized five factors for IoT adoption in FTLI. These 
findings will help government agencies and policymakers to develop freight transport strategies, such as Model share 
for freight transport and National Rail Plans. The study also assists transport managers in devising a plan to embrace 
Industry 4.0 and its requirements in the FTLI.

1. Introduction
Globalization has created a massive demand for international trade. Freight transport has emerged as one of the 
essential areas that can contribute to expanding international business through the most efficient movement and 
delivery. Along with this, freight transport generates unwanted externalities, such as congestion, pollution, accident, 
and infrastructure deterioration which hinder sustainability. These externalities have become critical as globalized 
exports increased by 13.8% (UNCTAD 2022). These vulnerability problems of freight transport can be assessed and 
regulated through the adoption of Industry 4.0, which emphasizes end-to-end digitization (Thoben et al. 2017) and is 
associated with many technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and Cloud computing (Falwadiya 
and Dhingra 2022).

Abstract 
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) has experienced extremely proliferation and grew by 42% in recent 
years. The US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in 2020 has indicated that the ESG-related 
investments accounts for USD 17.1 trillion of total assets under management by professional financial institutes. The 
corporate with superior ESG performance normally has higher values. This value enhancement may be achieved by 
alleviating information asymmetry, increasing future profit and cash flow, and lowering financing costs. On the flip 
side, some research works document no compelling evidence that ESG and financial performance can go hand in 
hand. One of the possible reasons is that the nature of performance evaluation is a multi-faceted. A simple performance 
evaluation architecture is not appropriate to drew the real picture of corporate’s inherent operation. Furthermore, the 
incorporation of ESG into the investment portfolio selection is still a controversial topic among academia and 
investment community. To fill this gap, this study aims at combining ESG performance and financial descriptors (i.e., 
value, quality and volatility) via a sophisticated architecture, namely two-stage cross-efficiency data envelopment 
analysis (CE-DEA) to uncover any weakness hidden in the best practices and yields a reliable suggestion for decision 
makers to form their investment strategies under anticipated risk exposures. The result indicated that the introduced 
architecture is a promising alternative for investment portfolio selection.

Introduction  
Potential investors become shareholders by investing in companies, thus establishing a stakeholder relationship and 
benefiting from earnings growth and interest on debt (Hsu et al. 2022b). However, in the contemporary investment 
landscape, investors seek not only short-term profits but also long-term and continuous investment value. As a result,

the aim of this article is to explore the process of selecting solidified companies as effective investment targets to meet 
the requirements of these investors (Hsu and Lin 2021; Ren et al. 2023). 
In recent years, societal changes have led to a notable consumer willingness to pay premium prices for environmentally 
friendly and sustainable products, as well as products from companies with a strong ethical reputation. Consequently, 
a company's engagement in sustainable-oriented practices, encompassing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
factors, holds significant influence over public favorability towards the brand, resulting in a higher inclination to 
purchase their products and driving profitability (Zneng et al. 2023). 
Furthermore, the adoption of ESG indicators provides a comprehensive understanding of the risks and opportunities 
associated with a company's operations, thereby enhancing its sustainable business value. By incorporating ESG 
considerations, companies gain insights into the potential risks and benefits stemming from their activities. Neglecting 
the risks that ESG poses to a company's operations can impede its transformation and hinder sustainable development 
(Wang et al. 2023). 
Consequently, the importance of corporate sustainability has witnessed a notable increase, becoming a prevailing 
widely-accepted trend. This trend has prompted a growing amount of investors to pay attention to ESG-related 
information and its impact on companies. ESG has emerged as a crucial sustainability-related indicator, recognized 
as one of the essential core elements for determining a sound investment target. 
Therefore, in response to evolving consumer preferences and the recognition of ESG's impact on a company's 
reputation and profitability, the incorporation of sustainable-oriented practices and ESG considerations has become 
imperative. The alignment of business strategies with ESG principles allows companies to enhance their brand value, 
attract consumers who prioritize sustainability, and unlock long-term financial opportunities. Moreover, for investors, 
assessing a company's ESG performance has become essential in evaluating the potential for sustainable growth and 
maximizing investment returns. 
To reach the goal, the advanced model that grounded on cross-efficiency data envelopment analysis (CE-DEA) and 
considered both ESG-related indicator and financial descriptors is introduced. The model, examined by real cases, is 
a promising alternative for portfolio selection. The policy makers can consider the potential implications and formulate 
the future policies so as to sound the development of capital market. The potential/current investors can follow the 
suggestions given by the model to adjust their valuable resource to maximize their personal wealth under anticipated 
risk exposure.  
The Introduced model 
Taiwan, which was primarily known for labor-intensive light industries and export processing industries in its early 
stages, after undergoing a transformation, it has gained significant recognition for its thriving electronics and 
technology industry. Taiwan's technological prowess in the industry has garnered international attention. According 
to TN Choice (2021), Taiwan's model, mainly focused on wafer foundry manufacturing, differs from the global 
semiconductor industry structure, which has contributed to Taiwan's unique competitive advantage. In 2017, the 
production value structure of Taiwan's semiconductor industry chain consisted of wafer foundry manufacturing 
accounting for 49%, IC design industry accounting for 25.1%, IC packaging and testing industry accounting for 19.4%, 
and memory industry accounting for 6.5%. The total production value reached $81 billion, ranking third globally, just 
behind the United States and South Korea. Taiwan holds the highest market share in the wafer foundry sector, 
occupying over 70% of the global market and generating a production value of $39.7 billion, it was an impressive 
achievement. Moreover, Chang (2009) found that 68.1% of high-tech industries in Taiwan are in accordance with 
business ethics and norms of conduct. Based on the aforementioned points, it is evident that the electronics and 
technology industry in Taiwan is an excellent subject of discussion. Furthermore, the European commission proposed 
the Net-Zero industry act in 2023. It forces the company who want to do business with E.U.-based companies need to 
reach the “Net-Zero” requirement (Zheng et al. 2023). Thus, the sustainability-related indicator (i.e. ESG) must to be 
taken into consideration for portfolio selection (Hu et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023).  
In the past, most studies merely take the financial descriptors, such as returns on assets (ROA), sales growth rate, and 
earnings per share (EPS) as a core element to determine their investment portfolio (Chang  2009; Wang et al. 2023). 
However, recent researches has witnessed that the target selection for investment which neglects the sustainability-
related indicators has higher change to reach investment failure. To navigate the investors to formulate a trustful and

Abstract 
Acceleration of the population ageing index is a current problem, and Portugal has one of the highest levels of 
population ageing in the European Union. In 2021, there were 182 elderly people for every 100 young people, and 
37% of these elderly people are dependent. Home care services are emerging as a social response to the problem of 
dependency, and as the population ages, its demand is increasing. In Portugal, most of these services are provided by 
non-profit organizations whose budgets are generally very reduced. 
This work aims to assess the impact of using optimization tools in the planning of home social care services, with the 
general objective of reducing the unproductive time related with the travelling of caregivers to and from patients’ 
homes. Through the application of an optimization model for home social care problem new routes are proposed for 
the home social care service provided by the Cáritas Diocesana de Setúbal. The results show that the routes achieved 
by minimizing the travel time will allow the introduction of new patients into the system and contributed to improving 
the efficiency of such services. Moreover, it demonstrates the potential of mathematical models in logistics planning 
for home social care.

1. Introduction
According to Pordata (2021), there are currently around 182 elderly people (aged 65 and over) for every 100 young 
people (aged up to 14) in Portugal, and the rate of ageing is increasing dramatically. Portugal is considered to be one 
of the oldest countries in the European Union, also in terms of dependency rates, with approximately 37% of the 
elderly being dependent (PORDATA  2021). As a result, the need for home care services is growing, following the 
trend already observed in other countries where ""... many older people prefer to age in the privacy of their own homes 
rather than in nursing homes. On the other hand, the availability of informal care by relatives is decreasing ..."" 
(Braekers et al. 2016). Vieira et al.  (2022) identify home health and social care as complementary responses to 
population ageing.

Abstract 
Researchers need to know the trends of specific themes and how the main methods are applied to solve the existing 
gaps. The objective of this research is to apply a structured methodology to select articles of high scientific relevance 
in the area of sustainable supply chain. In methodological terms, bibliographical research was carried out, which 
followed several steps, such as: filtering of journals with stratum Q1, database selection, choice of keywords; reading 
of titles and abstracts; classification of the number of citations; full critical reading of all articles in the bibliographic 
portfolio. With regard to research results, it was possible to identify through the frequency analysis, the types of study 
found in the portfolio articles; sustainable supply chain aspects; and the percentage of journals in the bibliographic 
portfolio, with their respective JCRs with a high impact factor. In addition to an extensive systemic analysis, which 
allowed identifying research opportunities.

Abstract 
This paper presents the development of a stochastic cost model aimed at determining the optimal number of operators 
required for a workstation, considering the activities performed by them, the time required for each activity, and the 
associated costs. The model takes into account the inherent variability in task performance and the corresponding costs 
involved. By utilizing the derived time equations, the study identifies both value-added and non-value-added activities, 
along with their respective costs. The proposed optimization model not only enables the estimation of the required 
number of operators but also provides insights into the impact of addition of workstation on the overall cost of the 
product. By considering the variability in task performance and associated costs, the model offers a comprehensive 
approach to operator allocation and workstation planning. Through the application of this stochastic cost model, 
organizations can make informed decisions regarding operator allocation, optimizing the utilization of available 
resources while minimizing costs. The findings of this research contribute to the understanding of the relationship 
between operator allocation, number of workstation, and production costs. The developed model serves as a valuable 
tool for decision-makers in the manufacturing industry, enabling them to analyze and optimize their operations 
effectively.

1. Introduction
Many companies are now including human resources as a core component of their business strategies due to the 
quickly evolving and fiercely competitive environment. Managers are looking for more effective tools to optimize the 
use and allocation of their available resources among the various services or systems in an effort to maximize or 
minimize certain functions related to performance and productivity. They are aware that human resources can play a 
significant role in the success of an organization. The issue arises in a number of real-world contexts, and research 
papers in the literature demonstrate a persistent interest in the human resource allocation problem and cover several 
useful applications. Costs are a relevant criterion that influences decision making and their estimation plays an 
important role in management. The key to a rising enterprise in the 21st century is product quality, competitive cost, 
fast delivery, and flexibility. The quality-functionality-price paradigm is a fundamental element of modern cost 
management that influences design changes that can be made collaboratively involving suppliers or clients towards 
the reduction of the costs of new products. Nevertheless, variability is a crucial aspect in costing models as it can have

of equipment. So, it is not worth to add an additional equipment to any workstation as it will only result into increased 
cost of the product.  
 
6. Conclusion 
It is evident that there exist huge variations in the demand from the customer. So based on that changes it is required 
to adjust the allocation of the resources accordingly. Over allocation or under allocation of the resources can have a 
huge impact on the production abilities and eventually on the profitability of the company. To avoid these situations, 
it is very important to design this allocation of resources carefully. But for allocation of resources, it is important to 
understand how much time is spent on each activity and variability that comes along and the calculation of the cost.  
 
In this paper, the optimization of resource allocation was divided into two parts namely Operators and Equipment of 
Workstation. Using the time equations, the variability in the operator tasks were measured and costs were calculated. 
As the assembly line had the target cycle time, it was necessary that the total time spent by the operator should be less 
than the bottleneck or target cycle time. By using the traditional linear programming resource allocation problem to 
obtain the optimum number of operators required and best possible workstations that should be allocated to them was 
decided. With the equations developed it was possible to understand the activities performed by operator which were 
value added and non-value added to the product. So, it was possible to bifurcate between them and calculate the cost 
for it to clearly understand how much it costs for value added activities and non-value-added activities along with the 
inclusion of the variability. 
 
Based on the target cycle time it is possible to calculate the number of equipment needed in order to achieve that 
target. Following that, various iterations were performed to find a balance between the cost and adding an equipment 
to the workstation, as adding an equipment had direct effect in the increase of the cost of the product. But in some 
cases, adding the equipment was advantageous as the waiting time for other workstations decreased along with the 
bottleneck of the assembly line. Therefore, the cost component of bottleneck decreased (might as well change to some 
other workstation) which compensated the increased cost tariff, so the cost of the product was reduced.  
 
But it is not always the case, as it was observed in table 6 that when the extra equipment was added it didn’t have 
much effect on the bottleneck, so the cost of bottleneck component didn’t reduce much but the tariff cost increased a 
lot which resulted into significant increase in the final cost of the product.  
 
Hence, it can be concluded that using this methodology in order to calculate value added time and non-value added 
time of the operator along with the information about the optimum number of operators needed and their allocation of 
the workstation will help a lot to take some managerial decisions as they will have clear picture about the cost and 
focus can be then shifted on the optimization of the non-value added activities. Also, in terms of decision making for 
the designing of the line this approach can be helpful to understand better the effect on the cost of the product by 
adding the equipment to the workstation.

Abstract 
In today's dynamic business environment, effective supply chain management is vital for maintaining competitive 
advantage. Supplier selection is a crucial aspect of “leagile supply chains”, ensuring alignment with lean and agile 
principles. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology using a recognized MCDM tool, MARCOS, to assess 
supplier suitability based on multiple criteria derived from existing literature. Moreover, the paper introduces a 
linguistic methodology by integrating MARCOS with the 2-Tuple Linguistic (2-TL) Model. This linguistic approach 
enhances decision-making by accommodating subjective assessments and linguistic preferences during the evaluation 
process. An extensive literature review encompassing lean and agile supply chains and supplier selection enlightens 
the study. A case study is conducted to validate the proposed methodology. The results and discussions provide 
practical insights into supplier selection for leagile supply chains. By understanding the fundamental principles of 
agility and leanness and applying the proposed methodology, organizations can strengthen their responsiveness, 
improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage in the market. The paper offers valuable guidance to 
organizations aiming to build robust and adaptable supply chain networks in today's dynamic business environment, 
contributing to the field of agile supply chains.

1. Introduction
In the present dynamic business landscape, supply chains hold immense significance in securing organizations' 
competitive edge. To navigate rapidly evolving market demands while ensuring operational efficiency, the concept of 
leagility has emerged as a strategic framework. Leagility combines the principles of agile supply chains, characterized 
by their ability to swiftly adapt, and respond to changes. It also combines lean supply chains, which prioritize 
efficiency through waste reduction. 
In an agile supply chain, flexibility and responsiveness are key (Nagel et al., 1998). It emphasizes the ability to quickly 
adjust production and distribution processes in response to shifting customer preferences, market trends, and 
unforeseen disruptions. Agile supply chains are designed to enable rapid product development, shorter lead times, and 
efficient collaboration with suppliers, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive edge in 
volatile markets. Moreover, a lean supply chain aims to streamline operations and eliminate non-value-added activities 
(Christopher, 2000). It emphasizes the reduction of waste, such as excess inventory, overproduction, unnecessary 
transportation, and unnecessary movement of goods. By optimizing processes, reducing costs, and improving resource 
1367",,"Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

integrated methodology, 2-TL-MARCOS, has demonstrated its effectiveness in facilitating the supplier selection 
process for leagile supply chains.  
However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The decision-making group consisted of three 
individuals from specific departments, namely marketing, IT, and supply chain. While their expertise and insights 
were valuable, the small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research should involve a larger 
and more diverse group of DMs to validate and extend the suggested integrated methodology for leagile supplier 
selection. Additionally, it is worth noting that the criteria suggested for this methodology are intended to be generic 
and applicable to leagile supplier selection in various industries and contexts. However, the results obtained from the 
application of the methodology in this case study are specific to the particular context of the ABC company in the 
FMCG sector. Therefore, caution should be exercised when generalizing these findings to other companies or 
industries. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the sensitivity analysis conducted by varying the criteria weights 
revealed consistent top-three rankings for the suppliers, indicating a certain level of robustness in the suggested model. 
This consistency suggests that the proposed methodology can maintain its performance and reliability even under 
changing criteria weights. However, it is important to note that these results are case-specific and may vary in different 
scenarios. Further research is needed to explore the robustness and generalizability of the model across diverse 
industries and supply chain contexts. 
 
To sum up, the combination of MCDM principles, linguistic decision-making, and the 2-TL-MARCOS methodology 
presents a promising approach for addressing the complexities of supplier selection in leagile supply chains. The 
suggested methodology offers DMs a structured framework to evaluate and prioritize potential suppliers based on 
multiple criteria. Further research should focus on validating and refining this methodology, particularly in larger-
scale applications, to enhance its applicability and broaden its impact within the field of leagile supply chain 
management.

Abstract 
Maintenance planning is one of the most important tasks carried out by a factory. Preventive maintenance is one type 
of maintenance that prevents major breakdowns from occurring. Increasing preventive maintenance duration reduces 
corrective maintenance duration. However, conduction of preventive maintenance causes downtime and incurs costs 
too. Several studies have been conducted to establish a tradeoff between these two types of maintenance to reduce the 
overall downtime. Models that minimize costs are preferred by industries. Besides, models requiring complex datasets 
are not readily adopted by most of the industries for regular use. This paper represents three different methods for 
optimizing preventive maintenance duration and frequency in a renowned flour mill factory of Bangladesh. The first 
method uses an established mathematical model which determines the optimum frequency of preventive maintenance 
per month, maximizing profit. This model is comparatively easier to adopt in flour mills since it does not use reliability 
concepts for different components, rather uses simple costs and downtime data, assuming constant failure rate. The 
second method modifies the existing model to optimize the duration of each PM inspection as well as frequency, 
which is an important parameter for flour mill maintenance. The third method uses three maintenance KPIs as inputs 
to determine the total duration of PM per month for the flour mills. The reason for not adopting PM models in factories 
is the lack of data availability and the difficulty in aligning the model with the existing maintenance plan. Besides, 
flour mills have components in continuous production lines which, if maintained separately, would not be profitable, 
rather a single PM activity should be carried out for some set hours, set by the maintenance department. The rationale 
behind this paper is to develop easily adaptable PM models for flour mills.

1. Introduction
Maintenance work is crucial for a factory. It is difficult to develop a maintenance plan and implement it that 
maximizes profit. The maintenance and operations departments are the largest, and each comprises 30 percent of the 
total manpower (Garg & Deshmukh  2002). Due to the inability to control the cost-based inputs, the consequent lack 
of planning and coordination may cause workers to wait for resources, incur additional material acquisition costs, or 
execute the work on an overtime basis (Weidner  2023).

6. Conclusion 
The flour mill factory can save a large amount of profit y reducing the mean preventive maintenance time to an optimal 
value by implementing the modified model, using two KPIs. They can also determine the overall preventive 
maintenance duration to be maintained for the following month, for a mill using current KPIs values as inputs in fuzzy 
model.  
 
As factories tend to implement models which are cost effective, the modified inspection model can be a well suit in 
industries. By implementing this model, they can maximize the profit considering all the variables necessary for the 
profit calculation. Besides, they can implement current constraints in their model which will give them an appropriate 
output aligned with the factory. 
 
 Some of the Future works can include, determining optimal KPI values for individual components of a flour mill. 
The maintenance departments set KPI values. However, techniques for determining their optimum values can be 
developed. Another scope for future work can be using other KPIs for fuzzy inputs rather than the major three ones. 
The flour mill factories can optimize preventive maintenance frequency and duration by using the modified inspection 
model and the fuzzy logic-based model. Also, factories who maintain a maximum downtime percentage and minimum 
mean preventive maintenance time, can also implement this model in their factories.

Abstract 
Internet of things (IoT) is being increasingly utilized in manufacturing where machines, devices and humans are 
connected and can communicate through the internet or the other wireless technologies at time and place. Quality 
represents a very important attribute of any system. Whether the quality is interpreted as the conformance to 
specifications, inverse of variability, or any other interpretation (like those related the satisfaction of customers or 
even having zero or almost zero defects), IoT can play an important role in improving this quality in manufacturing. 
Therefore, in this work, an overview of the application of IoT in manufacturing including advantages, issues and 
challenges, benefits and required enabling devices and technologies will first be shown. Then, an overview of quality 
as an important attribute of manufacturing systems will be presented and explained. Also, the work will show how 
IoT can play a pivotal and important role in improving the overall production quality in any manufacturing plant. This 
improvement of quality can be realized and will be in more than one form including the form of eliminating waste and 
deficiencies in products and also production processes, as well as in reducing cycle time and increasing the throughput 
and effectiveness of manufacturing systems.

Internet of Things (IOT), Manufacturing, Waste Elimination, Cycle Time and Quality Improvement 
Introduction 
Throughout the last few years, Internet of things or IoT has been emerging continuously where things and humans are 
connected, can communicate over the internet or the wireless world and are uniquely identifiable (Alothman et al. 
2018). This concept of IoT can be traced back to the early 2000s as K. Ashton was working on linking radio frequency 
identification or RFID data to the internet at the AutoID lab at MIT (Lopez Research LLC 2013) . 
With the use of IoT, customers are better engaged (Alothman et al. 2018) through the unique and continuous 
interaction between people (employers, employees and customers) and the systems (manufacturing system for 
example) which can virtually happen anytime and anywhere. Additionally, by utilizing IoT and the corresponding 
technologies, wastes can be reduced resulting in a better management of resources (Tutorial Point 2016). However, 
IoT has also some shortcomings including privacy and security (Rose et al. 2015 and Tutorial Point 2016). The 
introduction of IoT introduced a third dimension to the communication systems which is the “anything” dimensions 
which is added to the previously well known two dimensions of “anytime” and “anyplace” making it possible for all

advantages that some of which is yet to be revealed. With IoT, everyone and everything can communicate everywhere 
at any time opening the way for a huge number of possibilities. Some of the most important enablers of IoT are the 
Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs), advanced information technology systems and cloud capabilities. While IoT is 
applicable and can be adopted in several fields, manufacturing represents one of most important areas.  
Quality is a major aspect of any manufacturing system which means that it is always critical to achieve very high 
levels of quality and continuous improvement. Quality can be defined as freedom of defects, being fit for use 
(conformance and design), inversely proportional to variability and also reputation and customers satisfaction. Quality 
of products and processes can be improved tremendously through the successful and effective use of IoT in 
manufacturing. In fact, this can lead to quality levels that probably were not even possible before the introduction of 
IoT in manufacturing. Adoption of IoT in manufacturing results in a reduced numbers of defects. In fact, this number 
of defects can be reduced to (or almost to) zero which is clearly an important aspect of quality. In addition, IoT 
application in manufacturing can play an important role in reducing cycle time and tremendously increase throughput 
of basically any manufacturing system. On another front, IoT in manufacturing can also lead to an improved efficiency 
and reduced amounts of waste (regardless of the type of that waste) in the processes themselves. This clearly can lead 
to significant improvements in quality, quality control and assurance.  
Given that IoT is still in the phase of evolvement and increased utilization overall the world, it is necessary to have 
more research in this area in general like for example the area of information and cloud technologies, issues and 
challenges including security and privacy and the effective use of IoT everywhere. It is also very important to have a 
lot of research in the area of the effective adoption of IoT in manufacturing especially in the area of making current 
equipment and machines to make them IoT friendly; i.e. the ability to upgrade existing systems to have IoT 
capabilities. In addition, significant research is needed in the area of quality control in manufacturing and to be specific 
in the possible ways of transforming quality control aspects to go hand in hand with the very quick developments in 
IoT in manufacturing. In other words, some of the well known concepts and theories of classic quality control (which 
are absolutely needed all the time) need to be modernized to take full advantages of the all of the new and highly 
effective IoT data collection and processing techniques. For example, quality control charts and acceptance sampling 
techniques should be connected and should benefit of what IoT has to offer. At the same time, quality control 
engineers, technician should be trained well on the effective use of IoT in their fields. Also, quality control courses in 
universities can be updated to make students fully aware of improvements that are going in current real life 
manufacturing.  
This clearly means that a lot of research is needed to achieve this in companies and universities. Also, research in the 
area of lean manufacturing is absolutely needed. As was mentioned in this work, IoT adoption in manufacturing leads 
to reduced amounts of waste in manufacturing processes and this reduction is basically lies in the heart of lean 
manufacturing. So, the research opportunities are very obvious in this area. Finally, quality control connection with 
the area of operations research is something to heavily investigate. Operations research is absolutely needed to have 
an effective application of IoT in manufacturing given all of data and optimization requirements of IoT. This means 
that research that takes into consideration the development of new quality control techniques in parallel with 
operations research is a rich area of future research.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) that a host city 
can experience to utilize these for future strategy planning and event leveraging. Findings suggest that the strengths 
lie in having certain infrastructures in place, volunteers, a strong economy and good political standing. Weaknesses 
stem from a lack of infrastructure, the size of the country, uncertain political and economic stability. Opportunities 
included the growth of the tourism industry, business developments, and increase in the quality of life, the use of 
legacies post‐event, and the improvement and development of infrastructures holding a mega-event such as the 2022 
FIFA World Cup is a defining moment for Qatar, a country that is in transition, small in size and population, and rich 
in natural gas reserves. It is a unique opportunity to host a universal event and leave a sustainable positive legacy for 
the country. This study addresses the intersection between mega sports events and sustainability, to systematically 
compare and learn from past mega-events and apply that to the case of the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Herein, the 
challenges, opportunities, and progress are evaluated accordingly, showing that local organizers are applying green 
technologies and strongly upholding the idea of legacies based on the Qatar National Vision 2030, which envisions 
sustainable development of the country.

1. Introduction
 Holding a mega-event such as the 2022 FIFA World Cup is a significant moment for Qatar, a country that is in 
transition, small in size and population, and rich in natural gas reserves. International sporting events attract the 
attention of all sports fans and those in charge of organizing the event. It is considered one of the biggest opportunities 
to show the development of the hosting countries, and it abounds in the use and display of new types of technology. 
The case of Qatar is worth investigating to understand how the country is transitioning from traditional society to 
dynamic knowledge society and economy and analyzing key challenges ahead.  The 2022 World Cup is no exception, 
as new innovations and technology have been implemented to elevate the event to a state of the art the world has not 
seen before. Going back to the history of the uses of emerging technology, the previous 2018 World Cup witnessed 
the use of video assistant referee (VAR) for first time in World Cup match the media celebrated this development and 
considered it an evolution of sports history (Grez  2018), addition to a number of technologies used to detect and 
measure the performance of players and referees and enhance the experience and participation of fans of the game.

This study addressed the arrangement of the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup as sports mega-events considering 
sustainability as one essential concept for the organization within the frame of Qatar’s National Vision 2030. The main 
role of this study is to combine the sustainability issues and challenges, new technologies, legacies, motivations, 
opportunities. This sustainable approach assembled with the legacy vision on the World Cup organization is expected 
to drive different sectors of development of Qatar, boosting this new emergent country in the Middle East. Other 
contributions are the systematic analysis and comparison with other sports mega-events, to offer early warnings for 
additional measures to increase the sustainability level, and to ensure prolonged positive impacts on most if not all 
stakeholders. 
 
The extensive use of cutting-edge technical solutions has significantly increased mega-events success. In recent years, 
a number of large-scale event planners have used cutting-edge technology solutions to improve audience engagement, 
event security, and operational effectiveness. There will not be any changes in the Qatar World Cup. Qatar has poured 
much money into technology to ensure that the event runs well and serves as a blueprint for future sizable events 
(Dorsey  2013). 
 
The new approach using a reduced compact spatial model to organize the World Cup into the Doha city, with all the 
venues within one hour of transportation, allows some reductions in carbon emissions from the World Cup. The 
leverage of innovative technologies and new construction approaches can be helpful to likewise contribute to energy 
efficiency, reduction, waste management, and other problems. However, the challenges are also huge, mainly related 
to using the World Cup as a booster for sustainable development in different relevant economic, environmental, social, 
and human areas, in a small and arid country of an unforgiving environment. The successful order of the event 
demonstrates in the short-term, the hard-working and careful organization of the Muslim country in a world-class 
sports mega-events; in the long-term, it may turn into a future model of sustainable organization and positive 
contribution to the host country development. 
 
Qatar and FIFA organizers delivered a sustainable strategy related to the World Cup, which explained in more detail 
the carbon neutrality concept applied to this sports mega-events and the strategies used to operate the achievement of 
the carbon-neutral target. Socially, it is relevant to see the progress and measure effectiveness on workers’ human 
rights and the integration of the community as an early participant in the organization, leading to more democratic 
involvement of the civil society, which is due to be impacted by the legacies of the event. Such participation has 
already ensured a more satisfactory outcome and positive collective memory on other events. 
 
According to the drives that organized the event, Qatar eventually increased its global image and reputation, making 
it attractive as a new destination for different activities such as business and sports and developing the country socially, 
humanly, economically, and with respect to the environment, which are the four main pillars envisioned in the Qatar 
National Vision 2030. The Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy has already released a legacy book, a 
guideline to the main targets to be achieved after the event. Time will tell if the organizers will be able to translate the 
Qatar World Cup organization into an effective tool to drive such a vision.

Abstract 
Digitalization is a trendy issue in the business development world. It has experienced how vital the need for 
digitalization is during the Covid-19 pandemic process. Today's world needs digital transformation both to create a 
systematic data flow and to compete with competitors. Although the main reason behind digital transformation is to 
be able to compete because it helps businesses respond more effectively to the customer needs.  
Software product development differs from the conventional product development, so does the management of the 
project. In the last century, software development became a complex problem due to the change in customer needs. 
Thus, it requires different project management approach than traditional project management. 
This paper seeks to understand large-scale software development issue in terms of project management manners by 
reviewing literature. The paper will highlight the studies performed starting from 1992 until 2022. In doing so, the 
reader will observe the change in this issue over time. The papers are categorized into 5 groups according to their 
research questions. These groups are (1) project management and monitoring papers that focused on the governance 
of a project, (2) case study papers that they do not provide universal solutions but assess a specific case, (3) problem 
solving papers as they try to develop an algorithm to solve a problem during management processes, (4) 
explanatory/taxonomy papers which explains the terms and conditions of project management concept, and finally (5) 
literature review papers. To the best of authors’ knowledge, the literature lacks a review study which provides an 
overview of project management of software product development concept that contains all project management 
frameworks in the literature.

1. Introduction
Business development and innovation are trending concepts in business world. Business development refers to such 
actions that enterprises take to increase profit, production, sector growth, reaching out new customer segments (Kind 
and zu Knyphausen-Aufseß, 2007). These might be achieved via process or product development goals. Innovation 
as a term indicates new idea, methos, device or more generally, something new (Merriam-Webster.com, 2017). 
New product and process development approach is a way to succeed business development and innovation concerns 
of an enterprise. Developing a new product and/or process has its own difficulties such as uncertainty and ambiguity 
(Brun, Saetre, and Gjelsvik, 2009). Collyer (2000) declared that 75% of all business transformation projects fail. In 
addition, Peled (2000) stated only 16% IT projects in the United States are completed on time and budget. Standish

Abstract 
Banks play vital role in the economy because they manage investments for both individuals and corporations, operate 
the payment system, and provide credit. Previously, the banking sector was more focused on face-to-face interactions 
with customers to conduct business. Business process simulation is an essential Business Process Management 
technique that analyses business processes and validates process improvement. According to the contingency theory, 
the banks’ new digital focus must be aligned with business processes for them to function effectively. As one of the 
largest banks in South Africa, Absa Bank has embraced the use of digital platforms for customers and digitized most 
business processes to offer clients effective services or products. There is a need to align and understand the role that 
business process simulation plays in business processes to enable digital transformation in the banking sector. The 
purpose of this study is to investigate and understand the role of business process simulation in enabling the effective 
digital business transformation in the banking sector - a case study of Absa Bank Limited. An online survey 
questionnaire method was developed and distributed amongst Absa employees for data collection.

this empirical model for the generalization of results in other banks or financial sectors. This study suggests that more 
research should also be conducted across the financial sector broadly to assess benefits of business process simulation 
in enabling digital transformation. A comparison of digital transformation profiles in different financial sector would 
also shed light on how business process simulation can influence the transformation of the digital culture to enhanced 
organizational performance. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Due to digital advancements in the financial business market, financial sectors are currently digitalizing most 
processes to digitally transform and align in the current business market. This paper investigated the position and 
objectives of business process simulation in enabling digital transformation in financial sector. This paper highlights 
the benefits of business process simulation in enabling digital transformation. Cost avoidance is one of these 
advantages because businesses can simulate the solution for the future state and make financial decisions based on the 
simulation results. 
 
Business will be able to see the solution in action before it is designed and decide on the best digital platform that will 
fit the operational process and customer expectations thanks to business process simulation, which improves agility, 
speed, and data-driven decision-making through digital transformation. Business process simulation can provide the 
engineers or business with a view of whether their design will be fit for digital transformation strategy or purpose and 
would also provide a view of how the systems would perform provided different scenarios in real world.

Abstract 
During accelerated degradation testing (ADT), the component is exposed to higher levels of parameters that cause it 
to fail faster than it would under normal operating conditions. This approach saves time and reduces expenses 
associated with tool life tests for valuable workpieces. The fundamental assumption of ADT is that failure modes 
observed at elevated levels of parameters are similar to those under recommended usage conditions. In this study, tool 
failure modes are utilized to determine the appropriate levels of predictor variables, like cutting parameters and tool 
nose radius, for ADT of PVD-coated carbide tools during dry machining of Inconel 800. To study tool failure modes, 
experiments are done at three levels of cutting speed (Vc), feed rate (f), depth of cut (ap), and nose radius (r) by 
following the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Notably, a favourable tool failure pattern is observed when employing the 
middle level of the nose radius and operating at relatively higher cutting speeds while ensuring that f and ap fall within 
the recommended range. In the future, with the parameters’ levels established through this study, full-scale ADT will 
be performed and extrapolated to predict the reliability function of the cutting tool under normal conditions. The 
suggested method holds potential for various applications, including estimating the reliability of cutting tools and 
monitoring tool condition, among others.

1. Introduction
Cutting tool life prediction is crucial for effectively managing tool life, cost, machine tool availability, and machining 
process quality. Generally, cutting tools degrade stochastically, influenced by factors such as machining time, tool 
material and type, cutting parameters, machine tool type, workpiece, and so on (Zaretalab et al. 2019). To model the 
reliability function of cutting tools in a specific experimental setup, machining parameters like cutting speed (Vc), 
feed rate (f), depth of cut (ap), and geometric parameters like tool nose radius (r) must be considered. However, run-
to-fail tests for predicting tool reliability are expensive and time-consuming. Predicting cutting tool life without event 
data is difficult. This challenge is especially evident with new tools or in high-value operations where tool failure is 
unacceptable. It appears that the concept of accelerated degradation testing (ADT) of cutting tools offers a potential 
solution by reducing the consumption of costly workpiece materials and time.  
The fundamental assumption in ADT is that failure modes or patterns at higher levels of parameters are similar to 
those observed under normal working conditions. Among various types of tool wear, flank wear is a predictable pattern 
that significantly affects the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the final product. Therefore, the width of 
wear on the flank face serves as a criterion for predicting tool life (Siddhpura and Paurobally 2013). A cutting edge 
typically experiences flank wear as its primary failure mode, provided it does not fail due to other types of wear during

6. Conclusion 
This study focuses on high-speed machining of Inconel 800 using PVD-coated carbide tools, with a particular 
emphasis on observing tool failure modes to identify the levels of parameters that result in a desirable tool wear pattern, 
specifically flank wear. The experimental results demonstrate that maintaining the feed rate and depth of cut within 
the manufacturer's recommended range increases the likelihood of flank wear on the cutting tool when cutting at 
speeds significantly higher than the recommended range, using a middle-level nose radius. Given the challenges 
associated with machining Inconel 800, this experimental study provides valuable insights into determining the levels 
of machining parameters suitable for accelerated degradation testing (ADT) and identifying the geometric features, 
such as the nose radius, of the cutting tool to be utilized during ADT.  
 
In the future, full-scale accelerated degradation testing (ADT) will be conducted using the levels of cutting parameters 
finalized in this study to obtain degradation data. Subsequently, this data will be utilized to extrapolate and estimate 
the reliability of the cutting tool under normal operating conditions.

Introduction 
The purpose of this research leads us to the final results of the search in light of the data collected and 
analyzed in the framework of the main goals of this research, and in the light of these results provided a 
number of recommendations that the researcher believes that it will help in the application of quality 
management system and contribute in overcoming the problems that exist in institutions (under Search   )  
1.1 Background 
Quality is defined from the point view of customers as the ability of a firm to meet or exceed the 
expectations of the customer. Jablonski offers a five-phase guideline for implementing total quality 
management: preparation, planning, assessment, implementation, and diversification (Jablonski 1991). 
Quality is the degree to which an object or entity (e.g., process, product, or service) satisfies a specified set 
of attributes or requirements. The quality of something can be determined by comparing a set of inherent 
characteristics with a set of requirements (Diaz 2014). But for practical purposes, it is necessary to be more 
specific.  
Quality has multiple dimensions in the mind of customer such as conformance to specifications, value, and 
fitness for use. In industry, it is extremely important that the dimensions for example and quality of 
individual products be known and maintained. This is of particular importance where large quantities of 
parts, often made in widely separated plants, must be capable of interchangeable assembly (Arthur and 
Detoro  1992). Otherwise, difficulty may be experienced in subsequent assembly or in service, and costly 
delays and failures may result. In recent years, defective products resulting in death or injury to the user 
have resulted in expensive litigation and damage awards against manufacturers. Inspection is that function 
which controls the quality (e.g., the dimensions, the performance, and the color) manually, by using 
operators or inspectors or automatically with machines. The challenge for business today is to produce 
quality products or services efficiently (Ulrika and  Klesfsji  2000).  This is an important finding for the 
1459","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

questionnaire.  In addition, most of the factories have obtained the global certificate of ISO quality system, 
which was one of the targets within the factories that have sought it, Also the quality management of the 
factories have auditing and monitoring the processes and procedures in the implementation of the 
departments for operations and plans with large proportions. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
5.1 Conclusions  
The main results of the current research can be concluded in the following points: 
1. The existence of a quality management department of the company and named for the civil 
contribution since the establishment of its factories . 
2.   The Ahlia  Cement Company includes six factories, namely : 
 
                 Mergep Cement factory . 
                  Souq Alkames factory _ Amsehel (cement and lime).  
                   Lebda factory.  
                   Zliten cement factory . 
                   Msellath Bags . 
                   Algebs factory (ber ganem ) 
 
3. The reasons of establishing a quality Department in factories is to achieve the goals that set by 
senior management, as well as believing in the role of quality management in factories to support 
the rest of the departments . 
4. Quality Management factories do not have a major role in the development of plans and 
strategies.  
5. Most of the factories obtain the global certificate of ISO quality system, which is one of the 
targets the factories sought to obtain. 
6. The Recommendations that are placed by the Quality Management were only taken some of 
which, according to the desire of the staff. 
7. Quality Management check and monitor its operations and procedures in the implementation of 
departmental operations and plans. 
8. The Quality Management does not take part in taking decisions. 
9. Alburge factory, the largest cement producer in Libya does not have a department for Quality 
Management and there are no reasons for a rejection of the establishment, but on the contrary, 
urged the administration that there should be a special section of quality and that the separation 
of powers between the departments and the regularity of the workflow in addition to that there 
will be an incentive to compete for R & D with other factories. 
10. The existence of laws and regulations stipulates that the existence of quality management and 
industrial enterprises but they are not working out and refer to it.  
11. The proportion of staff in the Ministry of Industry Department who did not receive quality training courses 
67%. 
 
5.2 Recommendations  
Based on the conclusions of the research, some recommendations for future work can be summarized as 
following:  
 
1. More concentration on training courses and qualification programs to include staff and 
heads of departments . 
2. Supporting quality management by all means and involving them in decision-making . 
3. Participation of qualified staff from the Department of quality in decision-making . 
1465","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

4.
Set a monthly or semi-annually plan, including the assessment of the quality management
to the other departments .
5.
Alborg Factory, which is one of the largest cement plants in Libya and that precedes the
sales of its products, not to forget the importance of quality and put the thought out plans
and a clear and short term .
6.
Return to existing laws and recommendations for the management of quality in the
ministry, and work by the ministry and factories .
7.
There Should be communication between the ministry of industry and the ministry of
economy regarding the control of the local and the external products.
8.
Working on the training and rehabilitation to the workers of Quality Department in the
ministry.

The Ministry of Industry should increase the encouragement to the factories that follow the
system of quality in its products, and to consider in factories that do not have quality
department.
10. Finally, we recommend that there should be a study of comparison between the local and
the imported cement.

Abstract 
This study aimed to evaluate the old and new designs of the Arnis sticks bag and identify areas of improvement. The 
investigation was conducted in two phases, utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings from the one-
tailed independent samples T-test showed a significant difference between the performance of old and new designs of 
the Arnis sticks bag under the considered FEA criteria. The heuristics evaluation results also indicated that the new 
design was well-organized, consistent, comfortable, durable, secure, and satisfying. The Kano Model Analysis 
identified several features that provide customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Specifically, results showed that users 
like having and dislike not having compartment padding, cover, strap padding, and adjustable strap in the Arnis stick 
bag. However, attractive features like the expandable compartments, durable material, modern aesthetics, hanging 
loop, and buckle lock were not required but are highly appreciated. Based on the findings, the study recommended 
reducing complexity and improving the ease of use of the Arnis sticks bag. Incorporating features also classified as 
performance and continuously improving attractive features can add value to the product. Ultimately, the study 
provides valuable insights for future designers and researchers to improve the design of Arnis stick bags.

1. Introduction
Arnis sticks are the main components that distinguish Arnis from other sports. Keeping these sticks in a safe, durable, 
lightweight, and large-capacity bag prolongs their life and strength. Therefore, an Arnis bag is an essential part of an 
Arnis practitioner's equipment since it helps protect and organize their sticks when transporting or storing. However, 
these designs differ primarily in capacity, material, and ergonomics. Many Arnis stick bags have already existed on 
the market over the years, and even though they provide advantages over the Arnis sticks, most of these bags have 
also caused problems such as discomfort, especially for student-athletes. In developing the product design of the Arnis 
bag, it is critical to comprehend the fundamental requirements and standard processes. With those requirements, design 
thinking emphasizes the significance of comprehending the demands and preferences of the user. Hence, the study

6. Conclusion
Based on the findings presented, it can be concluded that the new design of the Arnis sticks bag is significantly 
different from the old design and has been well-received by users. The heuristics evaluation results show that 
the product meets the criteria for usability and user satisfaction. Additionally, the Kano model analysis provides insight 
into the features that are important to users, with some features providing satisfaction when present and not causing 
dissatisfaction when absent, while others are performance features that provide satisfaction when present and 
dissatisfaction when absent. No feature was identified as a reverse feature, and some features were indifferent. The 
analysis also highlights a potential issue with the padding of the compartment, which received a low quality level 
score. Overall, the findings suggest that the new design of the Arnis sticks bag has the potential to improve the 
user experience, although some improvements may be necessary to optimize certain features.

First-Come, First-Serve? Gig Worker Performance 
and Task Allocation in an On-demand Platform

Abstract 
On-demand platforms operating on a gig-contractor model rely on self-scheduling gig workers to meet real-
time demand, while maintaining desired levels of productivity and service quality. Such platforms usually 
allocate gig workers to tasks on a first-come-first-serve basis, which is often inefficient. This paper seeks 
to investigate whether allocation of workers to tasks based on prior experience and task characteristics could 
act as an alternative to the FCFS method. Since on-demand platforms frequently expand to new geographies 
where workers might not have prior experience, it is unlikely that allocating tasks to workers based on 
experience alone would significantly improve performance. We investigate whether recent experience can 
positively impact gig workers’ task performance, and thus be utilized as a ranking parameter in task 
allocations. Utilizing data from an on-demand grocery platform, we first developed an econometric model 
to analyze gig workers’ task performance based on their same-day experience, while accounting for sample 
selection and endogeneity. We find that as same-day experience increases, task productivity and service 
quality improves, even after controlling for worker and task characteristics. We developed two task 
allocation algorithms to allocate tasks based on workers’ rank, and task characteristics. We calculate 
predicted improvements in performance from the new allocations.

Introduction 
Over the past decade, on-demand service platforms have become ubiquitous. Such platforms connect waiting 
time-sensitive customers who need fast, reliable and easily accessible services to independent service providers 
(gig workers) (Taylor 2018, Benjaafar et al. 2022, Benjaafar and Hu 2020). These platforms include a plethora 
of services, such as online marketplaces (Etsy, Ebay), ride-hailing (Uber, Lyft, Cabify), and food (Doordash, 
Grubhub, Just Eat) & grocery (Instacart, Getir, Gorillas, Glovo) delivery apps, to name a few. According 
to Statista, the worldwide online food and grocery delivery market alone is projected to reach US$0.91tn in 
2023. Despite its advantages, gig work platforms pose operational challenges, such as the mismatch between 
demand for, and supply of services (Benjaafar and Hu 2020, Allon et al. 2023, Xu et al. 2023). In the online 
grocery delivery sector, in addition to the regulatory changes, the ever-increasing demand for quick turnaround 
times has forced on-demand grocery platforms to rethink their operating model and launch ultra-fast deliveries. 
However, since gig workers are not directly under the platform’s control, having quick turnaround times is 
often not feasible, as it requires gig workers to be available at the right time to serve consumers at short notice 
(Guda and Subramanian 2019). On-demand food and grocery platforms such as Instacart and Doordash realized 
that solely hiring independent contractors, who decide the amount of time, if any, to devote to the platform 
(Benjaafar et al. 2022), can lead to lost sales from a demand-supply mismatch. As a result, these platforms 
‘ditched’ the gig-work model to hire full-time employees (FTEs) (Cheng 2021) who can dedicate longer work 
hours, which not only improves the level of production per worker but also improves the quality of the picking 
(Golden 2012) through training and supervision that is unavailable to gig workers (Bloomberg 2015). Since 
a majority of gig-work platforms solely hire gig contractors who can self-schedule, it is crucial for managers 
to understand worker behaviors under this business model.

5.4 Validation – Task Allocation Algorithm 
In this section, we seek to understand the performance implications of two of our variables of interest, namely, 
same day experience (ODB) and prior task experience (ln_experience). The existing policy dictates that all 
available workers in a city, on a given date, and time slot should be allocated work, depending on the number of 
orders in that city-date-slot. If the number of workers is greater than the number of orders, then some workers 
are not allocated tasks. 
 
 On the other hand, if the number of orders is greater, some workers need to deliver more than one order in that 
slot. However, there is no defined way of allocations, which means a worker could be randomly allocated to any 
order. The objective of our task allocation algorithm(s) is to allocate tasks based on two criteria: First, where 
higher ranked workers are allocated to more complex tasks (determined using the variable, complexity ), and 
second, where higher ranked workers are allocated to newer customers (determined using the variable, 
repurchase priority). To calculate rank, we utilize the variable, orders delivered before along with same-day 
experience and prior experience. We first standardize all variables, excluding the binary and categorical 
variables, and run estimations on each of the three dependent variables (pickingtime, delay, 
substituted_when_reqd). We run the estimations on the main model(s), excluding squared and interaction terms. 
The absolute value of the standardized coefficients of ODB, and ln_experience are used to rank the predictors. 
The variable that has higher importance has a higher absolute value. We determine the ratio of the coefficients 
in each of the three estimations. In all three estimations, the coefficient of ln_experience is 1-2 times that of 
ODB. Therefore: 
 
ranki,t = ODBi,t + ln_experiencei,t - (7) 
 
We run our algorithm using the entire dataset. Same-day experience and Prior experience are re- calculated as 
new allocations are made each day. While making the allocations, we impose multiple constraints to reflect the 
realities of our setting as closely as possible. These include taking into account the hourly availability of the 
shoppers within a day. We further ensure that no individual conducts more than two tasks in a given hour, 
because orders are more likely to be delayed if the same worker picks more than two orders in an hourly slot. 
Other constraints include allocating workers to the same city in which they operate. Overall, the objective of the 
algorithm is to sort workers based on their rank (from highest to lowest), and then allocate them to tasks based 
on either complexity or the customers’ repurchase priority. Once the new allocations are made by the 
algorithm, we calculate the predicted pickingtime, delay, and substituted_when_reqd based on the new worker’s 
ln_experience and ODB. We then compare the productivity and service quality improvements from the proposed 
task allocation rules based on our econometric model, by focusing on ln_ experience and ODB and keeping the 
other variables constant. See Table 4 below:

Conclusion 
This paper investigates how recent (same-day) and prior experience affect gig worker performance in on-demand 
platforms. We further examine the moderating effects of task batching, complexity, and worker discretion in 
complex tasks. Using data from a leading sharing platform in Italy, we estimate the effects using a two-stage 
Heckman model with IVs. We then developed two task allocation algorithms and found that allocating workers 
to tasks based on task complexity and customers’ prior purchase experience can lead to improvements in task 
productivity and service quality. 
 
Although gig-work platforms are omnipresent in the food and grocery retail industry, enough attention has not been 
paid towards how to best manage workers such that the task performance is maximized, but not at the expense of

gig workers’ well-being. We first demonstrate that providing gig workers with the flexibility to choose hourly 
working slots could increase workers’ task performance as workers learn from same-day experience, while minimizing 
the detrimental effect of fatigue and the inability to select their work hours. We then demonstrate how allocating 
appropriate workers to specific tasks could increase both productivity and service quality. In particular, we 
demonstrate that allocating workers with high prior experience, and same-day experience to complex tasks, or to 
new customers can be beneficial.

Abstract 
The higher education sector spends a large percentage of the total revenue receipts on purchases of goods and services 
annually. It also faces multiple challenges with regards to its supply chain processes, such as deficiencies in 
implementation of internal controls relating to supply chain management and procurement. Other challenges include 
ancient systems and technology inefficiencies. These inefficiencies in procurement processes affect major research 
activities by having long lead times for research equipment. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of a 
procurement process for research equipment by conducting a survey among the users of this process. A survey was 
conducted at the using a sample of 108 participants from institution’s faculties. It was found that there were various 
issues and inefficiencies in the procurement process and ERP System such team responsiveness, order accuracy, time 
taken to prepare and approve requisition and asset registration time. The paper ends with propositions for improvement 
techniques to be utilized for further study and continuous improvement.

Introduction  
The higher education sector experiences multiple challenges with regards to its supply chain processes and they 
include lack of standardized processes and procedures, which in turn impacts efficiency (PWC 2015). A report by 
KPMG South Africa (2016) , stated that some of the challenges faced by the higher education sector include the poor 
implementation of standard supply chain management practices, inefficiencies in supply chain processes, poor 
planning for procurement and the lack of skills and capacity. At an institutional level, the Durban University of 
Technology (2018) noted that, institutionally, there were deficiencies in implementation of internal controls relating 
to supply chain management and procurement. Other challenges include lack of performance monitoring and 
management systems, as well as lack of adherence to the principles of demand and acquisition management within 
the broader university (PWC 2015). The lack of performance monitoring is as a result of departments instructing the 
buyer to use their preferred supplier because it is the only supplier who gives that particular service, and this affects 
in proper monitoring of supplier performance (KPMG 2016). The other causes of the challenges in the front of 
performance monitoring include the emergency orders that can encourage irregular expenditure. 
These challenges are further affirmed by Dlamini (2016), in a study to determine the challenges faced by 
comprehensive universities in South Africa hindering the implementation of best practices. These challenges include 
manual systems delays and technology inefficiency, unethical conduct, capacity & shortage of skilled staff. 
The inefficiencies in university supply chains such as procurement processes are affecting major research activities 
by having long lead times for research equipment, software and other enabling tools (Reynecke et al. 2018). Supply 
chain processes are the heartbeat of organizations as they ensure productive and proficient service provision. For any 
sector, efficient business processes are critical and imperative. On the organizational level, for the realization of 
business targets, a special attention to supply chain is essential, as this is the hub of the company activity. In order to

6. Conclusion  
In this study, the survey was done to ascertain inefficiencies in the procurement process of research equipment in an 
institution of higher learning. The extent of inefficiencies was categorized into two categories of satisfaction and time 
taken to complete task in the procurement process. Various issues were such as that the respondents didn’t not know 
the procurement team structure for purchase order tracking. Other issues were around time taken to prepare and 
approve the requisitions. Asset registration time was also an issue that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It is therefore critical to develop solutions around this area as to ensure that the critical key performance areas of the 
team are easily accessed and improved. Continuous improvement techniques such as DMAIC and Lean Office tools 
are used to recommend potential solutions for issues identified in the study. The recommendations also touch on the 
use of 4IR digitalization enablers such as big data, augmented reality and virtual reality. The implementation of the 
recommendations is expected to improve the supply chain efficiency and issues around the ERP system. The results 
of this research study, such as the dissatisfaction with the approval times, supplier payment delays and procurement 
team responsiveness, reveal that these problems identified, also occur in other HEIs in South Africa. This means that 
the universities must benchmark and align the processes have some uniformity across the higher education landscape 
and enabling knowledge sharing on processes, thus improving supply chain efficiency across the sector. The next 
phase of this study is to check how the improvements over time, through the tracking of key performance indicators 
in regular intervals. The learnings can then be shared through further publications and be implemented across the 
higher education sector.

Abstract 
Lean management has been implemented successfully to improve efficiency in supply chain processes. With the 
progression and implementation of Industry 4.0, there is an increase in digitization actions to focus on greater business 
results and productivity. Major organizations are focusing on implementing Industry 4.0 initiatives in supply chain 
processes to advance efficiency and productivity. It is uncertain whether the implementation of industry 4.0 
applications is in line with existing continuous improvement techniques such as lean management, which is known to 
have benefits in advancing business objectives. Therefore, this research is important in further exploring the synergies 
and practical implementation of both Industry 4.0 & lean management. This review looks at the practical applications 
of lean management and eleven industry 4.0 digitization enablers. The critical review of selected journal articles 
highlighting practical applications of the concept and integrative models was done to look at the integration models 
within industry 4.0 (horizontal, vertical & end-to-end engineering integrations) and challenges in adoption of the 
integration models. It further reviews the model of integration of lean management and the three industry 4.0 
integrations and how they can be combined together in a practical manner for organizational benefits.

Introduction  
Lean management has been implemented successfully to improve efficiency in supply chain processes. With the 
progression and implementation of Industry 4.0, there is an increase in digitization actions to focus on greater business 
results and productivity. Major organizations are focusing on implementing Industry 4.0 initiatives in supply chain 
processes to advance efficiency and productivity. However, the organizations must note that there cannot be a sudden 
switchover to Industry 4.0 initiatives, as there are management methods such as lean management that have been 
implemented. An integrated approach is necessary. 
Lean management, traditionally, has been used in the manufacturing world but recently there has been a move to apply 
lean manufacturing principles in supply chain management. The indication by Santos (2019) further stresses the point 
that lean thinking organizations implement lean manufacturing with the aim of eliminating waste in production 
processes. Waste can take form of anything over than the minimum required amount of equipment, materials, parts, 
and working time that are essential to production (Santos 2019). The types of wastes that are being reduced are, 
overproduction, waiting, transporting, over processing, unnecessary inventory, excess motion, defects (Fercoq et al. 
(2016). Plattform Industrie 4.0 (2022) defines as follows “Industrie 4.0 refers to the intelligent networking of machines 
and processes for industry with the help of information and communication technology”. Another definition of 
Industry 4.0 is “ is a strategic approach for integrating advanced control systems with internet technology enabling 
communication between people, products and complex systems” (Anderl 2014). Schmidt et al. (2015) also describe 
Industry 4.0 as the snowballing digitization and automation of the manufacturing environment as well as the creation 
of a digital value chain to enable the communication between products and their environment and business partners

the journal articles. It is therefore important to study the models of implementation explained in this review, for testing 
and validation in practical operational process settings as to improve the models. The evaluation of costs in 
implementing these integrative models is critical for comparison with the previous costs of non-integrated 
implementation as for further validation, return on investment and benefits.

Abstract 
Organizational change is a challenge for any company seeking to improve performance in a competitive 
marketplace. A key factor for improving the performance of a company is the recruitment of competent 
employees. In 2020, and more specifically since the coronavirus crisis, the whole world has begun to move 
towards remote working, whether individual or collective, due to its well-known advantages, such as reduced 
costs and working time. In this respect, for any company that wants to evaluate in a solid way the competences 
of candidates for the desired positions, with a reduction in costs and time, remote recruitment will be an ideal 
solution. In this article, we propose an Assessment Center model named Assessment Center Qual Position, that 
assess quality-related competences that enables companies to evaluate and select candidates remotely while 
dealing with the subjectivity of qualitative assessment. This approach is based on the assessment center model, 
the fuzzy 2-tuple representation model and the degree of similarity. 
Keywords 
Remote recruitment, Assessment Center, 2-tuple, Degree of similarity, competence and Quality management. 
1. Introduction
Traditional recruiting has always been based on simple interviews, asking questions that have become standard 
and are known to all candidates. It has also relied on selecting candidates based on their academic and 
professional qualifications. However, the latest version of ISO 9001: 2015 emphasizes the role of the competence 
concept in improving an organization's performance and implementing a quality management system. In fact, 
academic and professional qualifications and years of experience are not sufficient to judge a candidate's level 
of competence.  Therefore, competence has become a real challenge for organizations. In this paper, we define 
competence as the mobilization of knowledge, know-how, and know-whom to perform activities in a defined 
context. According to Le Boterf (1994), competence, by its very nature, is not observable and can only be 
observed and measured through the performance of actions. For Malglaive (1994), competence is ""knowledge 
in use"". In other words, it is adapted to action and its various occurrences. Le Boterf (2000) explains clearly that: 
« competence is always the competence of an actor in a situation ».  According to a definition provided by 
(Gilbert and Thionville  1990; Malglaive 1994; Zarifian 2001), competences are linked to work situations and 
are contextual. Similarly, the Mouvement des Entreprises de France (MEDEF 2002) states: « A professional 
competence is a combination of knowledge, know-how, experience and behavior exercised in a specific context.

6. Conclusion  
In this article, we present a virtual Assessment Center designed to help companies remotely recruit the best 
competent candidates for quality-related positions while meeting the requirements of ISO 9001:2015.The 
Assessment Center developed is flexible, allowing the company to implement its tests and simulations by 
identifying the competences required for the desired positions. The approach based on the integration of the 
linguistic representation of the 2-tuple and the similarity index is used for the competence evaluation and the 
candidate selection. Indeed, this approach allows to deal with the subjectivity of qualitative nature of competence 
and the subjectivity of expert opinions. It also helps recruiters select the best candidate using the similarity index, 
which measures the existing similarity between the candidate's profile and the company's required profile. 
Moreover, the competence levels acquired by candidates, calculated as 2-tuple, give companies an idea of new 
employees' competence levels and plan appropriate training programs for them.   
For perspective, we will implement this Assessment Center QualPosition model in a company that wants to 
recruit a quality-related position.

Abstract 
In this paper, an agent-based model is employed to study urban farm interconnectivity, with the goal of increasing 
food availability for the population and efficiently managing food, energy and water resources. Urban farms are 
presented as a case study, that belong to community microgrids that generate electricity from renewables (solar, wind), 
in the province of Chiriqui in Panama, is utilized to investigate the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. The idea of 
different farms serving different communities can be viable, however, sometimes there is a shortage of fresh food, or 
other times a surplus of fresh food, which leads to food wastage. Food waste has the capability of being transformed 
into fertilizers or into biomass energy, however when we consider the associated natural resources and costs used to 
produce food, avoiding waste would be a better alternative. Thus, it is crucial to investigate the food supply chain, and 
the interaction between different urban farms in a community shared agriculture fashion. An optimization model is 
employed to minimize food transportation cost between the farms within the agent-based framework. The results show 
that food availability is improved due to the exchange between farms while food wastage is reduced by 17,137kg. 
Furthermore, the simulations show that the sharing of energy through the microgrid employing renewable energy is 
economical and significantly reduced carbon emissions by avoiding 13,078 tonnes of CO2 and generating 16,560 Mwh 
of electricity through solar, and 2,333 Mwh of electricity through wind.

1. Introduction
In the industrialized global community, changes are occurring with regards to demographics, urban sprawls, 
technological advancements, globalization and changes in demand for water, food and energy resources. As demands 
for natural resources begin to increase, we must consider the fact that supply of these resources may decrease as well. 
This poses various challenges, that require policymakers to find more optimal methods of resource utilization in order 
to meet growing world demand. Energy and water resources are symbiotic and interconnected as shown through the 
generation, dissemination, and treatment of both energy and water resources, signifying the importance of efficiently 
managing these valuable natural resources. These resources are essential in the production and distribution of food 
and thus agricultural advancements are necessary in order to meet demands, and to ameliorate food and water security 
as well as resolving spatial challenges. A methodology has been established, known as the food-energy-water (FEW) 
nexus, which examines the interconnections and interdependence of resources, and is utilized to identify synergies, 
challenges and trade-offs that occur between resources. The FEW nexus approach is utilized to formulate policies and 
systems that would optimize the use of resources in order to meet strategic sustainability goals (Simpson and Jewitt 
2019). 
The key challenge will be to effectively integrate the interconnectedness of the progressing FEW nexus, as future 
projections indicate increased demand for food, energy and water resources. Water and Energy are key resources 
needed for food production, and energy and water are also related, as energy is required in treating and distributing 
water. This brief example signifies the importance of the connections that occur between resources and how it is 
crucial that we identify methods to manage them. There are a number of considerations that need to be undertaken 
with regards to food resources, and these include the optimization of food production, the diversification of food 
sources, and this will allow for the development of a robust food system, which looks to minimize carbon, water, and 
energy food prints, as well as reducing food waste. The current world population estimates will require that global

Abstract 
With the ever-increasing effect of climate change worldwide and many problems like geopolitical issues, population 
boom, etc., more people are experiencing food insecurity, and many more are at risk. Food security is a very complex 
topic, but many researchers have tried to arrive at a composite index to measure Food security. One such widely used 
measure is Global Food Security Index. This research has employed a statistical approach named Data Envelopment 
Analysis (DEA) to analyze the Global Food Security Index in detail. The indicators used to arrive at the composite 
score, i.e., GFSI, are only input based, i.e., they consider the existing resources and facilities available which can help 
a country bolster food security in the country. In contrast to previous approaches, our study takes a different 
perspective by incorporating output indicators as a means to calculate the composite score for measuring food security 
in each country. Specifically, we employ an output-based indicator, namely the Prevalence of severe Food Insecurity 
in the population, expressed as a percentage of the total population. This indicator serves as a measure of the country's 
effectiveness in achieving food security. By focusing on output indicators, our methodology provides a unique and 
comprehensive assessment of food security, taking into account the actual outcomes and impacts experienced by the 
population. We ran a DEA analysis on the GFSI scores for the 35 countries selected for 2017, 2018, and 2019. 
Different weighting approaches, namely equal weight, expert-based weight, and DEA-assigned weight, were also 
applied to arrive at the GFSI score. The results were further analyzed and compared to infer meaningful insights.

1. Introduction
According to the 1996 World Food Summit organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food security 
is defined as the state in which all individuals have consistent physical and economic access to safe, sufficient, and 
nutritious food that aligns with their dietary requirements and personal preferences, enabling them to lead active and 
healthy lives (Haysom et al. 2018). However, measuring food security poses a complex challenge, involving both 
technical and political aspects (Kutty et al. 2020; Elhmoud et al. 2021). When conducting food security assessments, 
it is crucial not only to determine what is being measured but also to approach the measurement process with caution. 
By employing a proper methodology, it becomes possible to concentrate on vulnerable population groups, identify 
underlying causes, and estimate the prevalence of food security (Bennbaia et al. 2018). Due to the multidimensional 
nature of food security and the diverse components it encompasses, developing a comprehensive index that 
encompasses all aspects of this concept is technically demanding. 
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2022), the escalating impacts of climate change 
pose a significant threat to food access and production, thereby undermining global food security and nutrition, 
particularly in countries that are already vulnerable. The food system, like other interconnected systems, has faced 
numerous challenges resulting from global crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, which 
have further diminished its resilience. It is crucial to prioritize the development of resilient capacities within the food

4. Conclusion and Recommendation  
The research has employed a statistical approach to analyze the Global Food Security Index in detail. The indicators 
used to arrive at the composite score, i.e., GFSI, are only input based, i.e., they consider the existing resources and 
facilities available which can help a country bolster food security in the country. Still, they don’t consider output 
indicators to arrive at the composite score used to measure the food security in each country. We used an output-based 
indicator, i.e., the Prevalence of severe Food Insecurity in the population in terms of population percentage, to gauge 
the country's effectiveness in Food Security. We applied three different weighting approaches: Equal weight, expert-
based weight, and DEA-assigned weight on the data to calculate the GFSI scores. 
 
Based on the statistical analysis performed, it was inferred that the countries at the bottom of the Global food Security 
Index rank list are the countries achieving the efficiency score of 1. Overall, the bottom-ranked countries of the GFSI 
rank list perform better than those at the top. The countries at the top of the GFSI rank have excess resources and 
facilities, which awards them the top position since the GFSI doesn’t account for any output indicators regarding food 
security. When we compared the performance of the countries not just with the input indicators but with the output 
indicator, i.e., Prevalence of severe Food Insecurity in population, then we found out that the countries at the bottom 
of the GFSI rank list despite fewer resources and facilities fared better than the countries at the top. If we analyze all 
the countries which achieved a DEA Efficiency score of 1 through the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 for different 
weighting cases, it is found that all of these countries are ranked below 20 of the total 35 countries in the list.  
 
Moreover, when we plotted and compared the DEA Efficiency score-based rank v/s GFSI rank, it was clear that the 
countries at the top in the GFSI rank are placed at the bottom in the DEA Efficiency score-based rank. Similarly, the 
countries at the bottom of the DEA Efficiency score-based rank are at the top of the GFSI rank list. For example, in 
2017, countries like Brazil, Bulgaria, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, and Uruguay achieved an efficiency score 
of 1, but they have GFSI ranks of 31,32,35,33,27,30, and 29, respectively. The same phenomenon was repeated in 
2018 and 2019 by GFSI bottom-placed countries by achieving an efficiency score of 1. Only a few exceptions have 
arrived where these countries remained in the same region in the rank list, like New Zealand, Greece, etc. 
 
However, it is important to note the nature of that DEA as it doesn’t consider the country's cultural, political, and 
comprehensive view to arriving at results like a human. So, while using the analysis results to frame policies, we must 
comprehensively view the country’s status and capabilities so we don’t arrive at wrong and ill-suited policies. 
 
The primary challenge associated with this research was the unavailability of data about the nutritional state of citizens 
of all the countries for a longer time frame. Nevertheless, it is an opportunity for future research. It works as an 
extension of this research to study the feasibility of statistical methods which can help countries find their weaknesses 
and achieve the highest efficiency possible along with a highly food-secured population. For future work, the author 
recommend to exted some of the advanced regression method in generating weight of the food security dimensions; 
see for Abdella 2021b. This would provide the decision-makers with small space of indicators the matter that help in 
clearly identify the oppurtunities of enahnacement for the food security performance.

1. Introduction
The automobile industry in general is characterized by very high competitiveness and product diversity. Morocco has 
become the leading construction hub on the African continent, ahead of South Africa and Egypt with distribution on 
an international scale. Adaptation to new technological changes can be essential for the success and growth of a 
company in the logistics and distribution sector. Technologies can help companies improve the efficiency and 
flexibility of their distribution system, expand their range of products, reduce costs, and provide increasingly high 
levels of quality and timeliness. Industry 4.0 is a major digital transformation in the industrial sector that involves 
intelligent automation and increased interconnectivity between machines, products, and people throughout the value 
chain. 4.0 factories are designed to be connected and intelligent, using advanced technologies. 
VSM 4.0 is an evolution of traditional VSM, which has been adapted to include new technologies such as IoT, AI, 
and data analytics. It enables visualization of production processes and detection of waste, including information 
waste, that can have a negative impact on the efficiency and profitability of the business. Companies can design more

The merging of picking and consolidation using AS/RS (Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems) and Warehouse 
Management Systems (WMS) can help reduce processing times and picking errors in the supply chain. AS/RS are 
automated equipment that can quickly move materials and products within a warehouse, while WMS can efficiently 
manage inventory and warehouse operations. The use of cobots (collaborative robots) and IoT sensors for palletizing 
and transfer can improve the safety and accuracy of operations while reducing cycle times. The use of RFID 
technology for verification and file editing can help speed up verification and tracking processes. RFID tags can be 
used to track products throughout the supply chain, enabling quick error detection and problem correction. In 
summary, the use of technologies such as AS/RS, WMS, cobots, IoT sensors, and RFID technology can help improve 
productivity, accuracy, and speed of operations in the SC. The implementation of technologies has led to significant 
gains in the following areas:

By introducing Industry 4.0 technologies within the warehouses in Casablanca, we have achieved a gain in Lead Time, 
which has been reduced from approximately 200 to 28 minutes, and we have also optimized the number of positions 
by 36% and the number of operators by 71%. 
 
Conclusion 
The presented VSM 4.0 method is an extension of the well-known VSM method. VSM 4.0 focuses on redesigning a 
standard process from a Lean Manufacturing perspective, as well as processing all the necessary information for a 
value chain. One of the key benefits of using VSM 4.0 is the ability to monitor processes and quickly identify any 
inefficiencies or waste in real-time. This allows for quick adjustments to be made, leading to a more agile and 
responsive production process. In addition, the interconnectivity provided by the technologies 4.0 allows for greater 
collaboration and communication between machines, processes, and employees. 
 
Another important aspect of VSM 4.0 is the integration of Lean Manufacturing principles. This involves not only 
streamlining processes, but also reducing waste, optimizing resources, and improving quality. By combining the VSM 
methodology with the principles of Lean Manufacturing, companies can achieve a more efficient and effective value 
chain.

Abstract 
Towards a sustainable and resilient digital cold supply chain, environment sensing technologies and Big data analytics 
combined with Artificial Intelligence can extract critical information and provide a systematic framework for product 
optimization and safety enhancement. Our research focuses on a descriptive analysis framework of a real-world dairy 
food distribution system, using historical data collected from embedded sensors inside refrigerated trucks. The dataset 
consists of 5,972 records that present the distribution schedule, the collected temperatures and the refrigerator’s open 
door window in seconds. The measurements are taken both on-route and while loading/unloading from various

temperature measurements. 
 
3.4 Overall Results for decision support 
Based on the descriptive analysis conducted by the authors several conclusions have been produced regarding dairy 
products distribution characteristics and temperature behaviour. Initially, as expected, in the summer period 
temperature fluctuations are intensified both on route and on the delivery points, and the operating time of the 
refrigerator is extended. Additionally, the refrigerators’ operation in the majority of the trucks has some periodic 
characteristics (operates until a specific temperature is achieved) resulting in continuous temperature changes. 
However, in the winter period, a specific track did not have any temperature fluctuations due to the fact that the 
refrigerator was turned off. Moreover, in some cases, it is observed, that while the mean temperature difference when 
on the route is relatively low the same variable on a delivery point has a relatively high value. In the aforementioned 
cases, the total number and duration a door is left open at a delivery point is extended verifying the correlation between 
mean temperature differences and open door frequency.  
 
Hence, it can be considered that this specific behaviour is triggered by a human factor and not by a refrigerator’s 
malfunction. On the other hand, some instances in the summer period were identified where temperature fluctuations 
were intense on average, both in motion and at a delivery point. This occurred even without the door being open for a 
particularly long time. Thus, this may be due to insufficient maintenance of the cooling unit or issues of insufficient 
thermal insulation of the vehicle. During the winter season, even if the doors remained open for a long period, 
temperature differences in the chamber were not particularly affected. Finally, some distributors had low-temperature 
deviations and optimal performance due to the efficient refrigeration unit and thermal insulation but also due to the 
efficient use of the doors by the human operator. 
 
4. Conclusion 
A descriptive analysis and performance comparison in a digital cold supply chain environment is presented. The uprise 
of Cyber-Physical Systems, the Internet of Things, Big Data analysis, 5G technologies and Artificial intelligence 
enhance the implementation of smart decision support systems assessing the safety of dairy products and refrigeration 
efficiency during distribution. Following the system definition, a comprehensive framework of a data analysis 
approach combining data cleaning, data pre-processing, data visualization and result evaluation was developed 
enhancing the decision-making process. The results compared the efficiency performance of various delivery trucks 
during winter and summer periods and verified the excessive correlation between temperature differences and open 
door timelapse especially during the summer period. The future work of this research seeks to collect additional 
historical data containing deteriorated product measurements (measurements from products that do not have their 
organoleptic properties) in order to develop a predictive algorithm for product condition prediction and prescriptive 
approaches for system optimization and loss prevention. Another extension of this work is to enhance descriptive 
analysis focusing on dairy product temperature differences when on different crate positions inside the distribution

Abstract 
With the increasing focus on process automation and the advent of Industry 4.0, predictive maintenance strategies 
(PdM) have gained significant attention. These strategies enable maintenance actions to be performed when necessary, 
reducing downtime costs and enhancing the efficiency and availability of production machinery. The widespread 
adoption of advanced analytical tools and Machine Learning (ML) technologies has facilitated continuous monitoring 
of machine operation through the development of PdM models.  In this study, we propose an ML-based approach to 
develop a prediction model specifically for the manufacturing sector. The model employs supervised learning, 
utilizing the sliding window method and the Support Vector Machine algorithm (SVM), reaching an accuracy of 
99.7%. By leveraging artificial intelligence for predictive maintenance, our algorithm enables the monitoring of a 
centrifugal pump using acoustic and vibration parameters. This enables the identification and prediction of five 
distinct operating conditions of the pump.

1. Introduction
Maintenance is a complex activity that involves various actions and strategies. Corrective Maintenance, for instance, 
involves taking action only after a breakdown or failure has already occurred. While this type of maintenance initially 
incurs no costs, it can have a significant impact on a company by causing longed production interruptions. 
On the other hand, Preventive Maintenance is performed proactively, aiming to prevent machine damage by 
conducting scheduled work based on predetermined time intervals or asset usage intensity. This strategy offers 
advantages such as improved work organization, efficient downtime management, and process optimization. 
However, it also results in increased maintenance costs, which may not always be strictly necessary or cost-effective. 
Predictive maintenance is a proactive strategy that involves continuously monitoring operational parameters like 
vibration, temperature, energy consumption, fluid levels, and others to analyze machine conditions and predict future 
failures. By implementing predictive maintenance, productivity can be increased, costs can be optimized, and 
unnecessary interventions can be avoided. This strategy effectively mitigates problems and risks associated with 
potential breakdowns and production interruptions. 
Among the various machines used in production, the centrifugal pump holds significant industrial applications, 
ranging from food processing to water and sewage transportation. It is a commonly used pump in various industries 
and is liable to failures caused by issues within the fluid, such as cavitation, as well as mechanical faults in components 
like bearings and seals. Vibration monitoring is a suitable method for identifying faults within pumps. To prevent

Figure 6 shows the results obtained, divided into 5 classes while Table 6  reports Positive Prediction Values (PPV) 
and False Discovery Rates (FDR) of the proposed model, divided for the 5 classes (no defects, broken impeller, 
clogged impeller, bearing with internal position defect and bearing with external position).

Class 1 scored a slightly lower performance with prediction errors of 0.9%, and it had the highest False Discovery 
Rate values among all the classes.  
 
The results obtained in this study, utilizing appropriate pre-processing with the sliding window method and ML 
techniques, have demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities with higher accuracy values (99.7% accuracy) 
compared to the previous forecasting models proposed by Kumar et al. (2020) in all cases except for the improved 
CNN model with a modified cost function, which achieved a 0.3% higher accuracy. However, the improved CNN 
model is more complex, resource-intensive, and requires longer training times compared to the SVM model proposed 
in this study. Therefore, the proposed solution is more effective and efficient. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This study focuses on developing a predictive model for a centrifugal pump, aiming to assess its condition and predict 
the type of fault using ML techniques. The experimental datasets used in this study include acoustic and vibrational

data collected from a test bench. The sliding window method is employed for data preprocessing, and the chosen 
prediction algorithm is SVM. The obtained results demonstrate excellent accuracy levels (99.7%), highlighting the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the methodologies used, which also have cost advantages over deep learning-based 
methods. 
For future studies, it would be beneficial to optimize the prediction performance for class 1, which obtained lower 
accuracy values, by exploring more specific ensemble algorithms. Additionally, the application of the developed 
predictor in real maintenance scenarios could be evaluated, considering cost analysis. Furthermore, regression models 
could be applied to the vibrational and acoustic data to determine the residual useful life (RUL) of the centrifugal 
pump, offering valuable insights for maintenance planning.

Abstract 
The goal of the study is to assess Indonesian halal food in the future in terms of structure, behavior, performance, and 
digital marketing.  Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, has a comparative advantage in that it 
has many options to produce and export food and drinks of high export quality that adhere to halal standards.  Although 
there are several sources of food raw materials, their utilization is not ideal. The study's objective is to evaluate 
Indonesian halal food in the context of structure, behavior, performance, and digital marketing in the future.  The fact 
that Indonesia, which has the biggest Muslim population in the world, has a variety of ways to produce and export 
halal-compliant foods and beverages gives it a comparative edge.  Although there are many places to get food's raw 
materials, the way they are used is not ideal.

Introduction 
Industry companies have been obliged to reevaluate their 2020 goals as a result of the corona virus pandemic, often 
known as Covid-19. According to the Association of Indonesian Food and Beverage Entrepreneurs (Gummi), growth 
would be between 8% and 9% in 2020. Food and beverage growth is forecast to be only at the level of 4% to 5% if 
GDP is forecasted to be between 0.4% and 2.3% lower. 
 Food security is viewed as a societal advancement that might enable the globe to adequately feed more than 10 billion 
people (Anis and Norfaria  2022). According to statistics from 2018, Indonesia has a population of 252 million, a 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of IDR 15,833,943 billion, 6,749 firms that produce halal food, and 937,599 workers 
overall. There are 1,741,779 businesses in the small halal food sector, employing 3,612,058 people. Along with 
conventional and contemporary digital marketing, halal food goods should see an increase in sales and business 
continuity in order to expand their marketing reach internationally. It is now time for developing nations. For medium 
and large to start emphasizing adequate food security in social and economic development as well as benefiting from 
economic growth and trade in clothing and food that are needed by many nations, the manufacturing GDP must reach 
3,119,617 billion ($19.70%), there must be 29,554 companies with a total workforce of 6,005,669 people, and these 
numbers are from the manufacturing sector (New et al. 2017). 
 The business world of the food and beverage industry works with the product mix, local culture, and consumer desires 
to create a distinctive and easily recognizable characteristic. If it is deemed to be good, producers distribute it to the 
market in order to meet the various needs of consumers and their various desires (Medeiros et al 2017).  Based on a 
number of factors, including applied technology, human resources, market potential, and economic contribution, as 
well as a review of the viability of local superior products from an economic perspective, significant attempts to 
increase socioeconomic development can be found. Development of local agriculturally based food items and other 
commodities for local communities utilizing appropriate technologies (Tulipa et al. 2020).

4. Using market space and marketplace as two different sorts of buying and selling transactions in e-commerce. 
Through the use of many new digital marketing strategies, the internet changed the way that things are marketed. 
5. With the correct digital skills, businesses may collaborate across industries and B2B and B2C enterprises to establish 
brands, expand market share, and boost consumer loyalty.  Determines the marketing strategies that will be 
employed. Prospects, analysis, and adoption of other successful businesses are factors taken into account while 
developing a plan. 
 
Discussions 
1. The Indonesian food industry should be governed by rules that make it simple for export-oriented goods and halal 
products. The number of companies is too great, and newcomers can easily enter the market, creating a very high 
level of competition. This recommendation goes especially for the Ministry of Industry and Trade. 
2. As the largest Muslim nation in the world, Indonesia has a comparative advantage when it comes to exporting high-
quality, halal food products to other nations. The government offers advice at trade shows, and the industry offers 
the widest possible range of products for the Indonesian halal food industry. 
3. There are many companies in Indonesia, even though they have gone public but all of them are small, so that the 
company's performance is not optimal, it is suggested that several large companies including those that have gone 
public mergers, multi company, innovation and the use of high technology so that the cost efficiency can ultimately 
compete with other food companies in other countries in the international world. 
4. Indonesia, the most populous Islamic nation on earth, has the potential to produce halal food, not only for exports 
and imports but also to promote marketing expansion in other nations by undergoing digital marketing 
transformation to boost sales and branding of goods or services. 
5. Indonesian halal food products joint venture can collaborate with businesses selling to consumers and businesses 
selling to other businesses in a variety of markets and industries to establish brands, expand market share, and 
boost client loyalty and value with the correct digital skills.

Abstract 
Contemporary cities have taken up efforts to decarbonize urban mobility which has led to a growth in electric 
vehicles and investment in new renewable energy opportunities. The current transport sector contributes to 
greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. This has led to a growth in studies to develop a 
reservoir of knowledge on sustainable mobility to address this challenge. The global shift towards electric vehicles 
has provided greater energy efficiency as part of the global climate change mitigation strategies, however, electric 
vehicles are not widely adopted in developing countries due to factors such as insufficient charging stations. 
Globally this shift to electric vehicles and the spatial distribution of  charging stations has been informed by the 
private sector. This has led to city authorities to be reactive to the implementation of electric vehicle and its charging 
infrastructure. There is hence a need to assess the readiness of spatial planning to facilitate the transition towards 
electric vehicles and its infrastructure. Given this emerging trend in urban mobility transition, there have been lack 
of proactive policy initiatives to inform the adoption of electric vehicles. Using a qualitative research approach this 
study unpacks the adoption of electric vehicles from urban spatial planning perspective. Fifteen participants from 
the city of Tshwane were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. The participants were selected 
using snowball sampling and purposive sampling. Content analysis was used to develop themes. Findings of the 
study reveal areas where the charging infrastructure is placed, as these can be found in public spaces such as 
shopping malls and office parks in the city of Tshwane. The implications of the study are creation of a reservoir on 
knowledge to inform plans for developing countries such as South Africa to integrate spatial distribution of 
charging stations with sustainable mobility initiatives. Future studies should develop a framework to inform the 
broader aspects of spatial planning in relation to innovative sustainable transport systems.

Introduction 
Contemporary cities have taken up efforts to decarbonize urban mobility which has led to a growth in electric vehicles 
and investment in new renewable energy opportunities. Scholars have articulated that emerging challenges in cities 
result from an increase in urbanization (Bayram and Bayhan 2020). In developing countries these challenges provide 
an opportunity for cities to invest in new smart technologies to inform the transition towards sustainable urban growth 
and sustainable urban mobility (Banister  2011). The role of technology in urban mobility is concerned with the aspects 
of sustainable and integrated smart urban mobility systems (Lyons 2018). The global shift towards electric vehicles is 
progressing and centered around the concept of sustainable smart  urban mobility system (Faira et al. 2014). Electric

in urban mobility,  there should be a clear integration of transport systems with urban activities in the transition towards 
electric mobility.  
 
At present, the technology and infrastructure for electric vehicles is advancing faster than government regulations, 
creating uncertainty regarding the impact of this technology on urban spatial structure and interactions. The integration 
of electric vehicle technology with land use planning should be aligned with the goal of promoting sustainable mode 
of transportation and fostering inclusive and sustainable communities.  
 
Urban planners can play a crucial role in facilitating the adoption of electric vehicles and its charging infrastructure 
by designating appropriate areas for charging stations, the designated areas should support and promote the sustainable 
mode of travel. Urban planners can support the incorporation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure into existing 
transport networks. Urban planners can also use data on transport patterns and charging behavior to collaborate and 
inform policymakers to develop regulations that promote the adoption of electric vehicles and its infrastructure in an 
inclusive and sustainable manner. Transitioning towards electric mobility necessitates a shift away from transport 
planning that primarily favors private vehicles to planning that favors public transport mobility networks, public 
infrastructure should for public transport planning should be the starting point for transitioning towards electric 
mobility. 
 
Urban planners can potentially work with private companies to establish partnerships to co create new planning 
approaches for the installation of charging stations, this partnership can assist in the successful  deployment of 
charging infrastructure and contribute towards sustainable and low emission transport systems.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study has sought to examine the involvement of urban planners in the transition towards electric vehicles. 
Technological change in urban mobility has the potential to influence or change the urban form and the urban 
interactions. The link between the urban formation and the transition towards electric vehicles is often not recognized 
due to lack of research which is also worsened by lack of clear planning policies. The spatial formation can potentially 
facilitate the transition of new urban mobility systems by connecting the new urban infrastructures and urban 
interactions through the use of advanced public transport systems, furthermore, having spatial knowledge has the 
potential to inform urban planning policies to ensure that the city of Tshwane meets the objectives of being a 
sustainable and inclusive city. Sustainable transport systems form part of sustainable urban cities, the transition 
towards innovative transport systems must be clearly integrated with the objectives of the city of Tshwane being an 
inclusive and smart city. 
 
Through clear stakeholder engagement, new ways of thinking is required to respond to the emerging technology of 
electric vehicles, currently there is lack of coordination between various departments in the urban planning field which 
has the potential of resulting in poor planning for electric mobility. The private sector is emerging as the main actor 
facilitating the transition towards electric mobility. Since the technology of electric vehicles is still considered to be 
new, it is not yet clearly examined from a spatial form perspective. Urban planners are not yet prepared to respond to 
the emergence of electric vehicles and to respond to the potential spatial formation caused by these new innovative 
vehicles, furthermore, urban planners have unclear mandates in the transition towards electric mobility.  The local 
government needs to have a clear understanding of this urban spatial transformation driven by smart city technologies 
to facilitate an inclusive and sustainable urban development. Proactive urban planning policies are required to manage 
the spatial patterns of electric mobility in a manner that is aligned with the objectives of sustainable urban planning 
and development.  
 
The findings of the study can foster strong collaboration between private companies and urban planners, while also 
providing support for the establishment of regulations. These regulations would ensure that the deployment of 
charging stations follows the principles of stakeholder engagement to co create new innovative regulations that foster 
inclusive distribution of technological advancement. 
 
Further research can build upon the findings of this study to identify and precisely articulate the challenges associated 
with the current  urban planning approaches and policies  promoting the progress of the electric vehicle deployment, 
furthermore, the spatial implications of introducing the electric vehicles should be clearly defined to inform the 
policymaking processes.

Research can additionally examine the travel behavior of the electric vehicles and the geographical distribution of 
charging stations to assist urban planners in formulating clear future planning guidelines informed by the current 
existing charging behavior and location of charging stations. The current spatial distribution of electric mobility 
infrastructure  can inform the connection between future land use planning and transport planning to shift away from 
private vehicle-based planning.  
 
The study primarily concentrated on understanding the spatial readiness towards electric mobility within the context 
of the urban environment, paying less attention to the travel behavior of existing electric vehicles and charging stations, 
this limitation highlights the need for further investigation, additionally the research focused on electric mobility in 
terms of private electric vehicles.

1. Introduction
Industrial revolutions primarily aim to transform the technological landscape of a particular era. Throughout history,
it has been widely acknowledged that technological advancements play a pivotal role in driving value creation,
exchange, and distribution. (Xu et al. 2021b).  Studies have shown that the general well-being of workers has greatly
improved over the years due to the gradual annihilation of labor-intensive tasks, production improvements, and time
savings with the progression of each revolution.  (Krekel et al. 2019) In light of the impact of technological
advancements on value creation, exchange, and distribution, the emerging concept of 'human centricity' has become
a pivotal focus in the industry. It is crucial for technologies to be intentionally designed to align with future social
values, as emphasized by Xu et al. (2021).

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general made significant progress in recent years. These new developments such as Deep 
Learning, improved Loss Functions, Generative adversarial networks (GAN) and Natural language processing (NLP) 
are mature enough for widespread adoption in the consumer market. Many of these technologies find can be applied 
in domains outside of computer science. This paper gives an overview over such applications and use cases of AI in 
manufacturing, groups the use cases into categories and presents some exemplary use cases in detail. 
From predicting maintenance needs to optimizing supply chain operations there is a plethora of use cases for AI in the 
manufacturing domain. AI can be considered as key enabling technology in the Manufacturing sector, as it feeds the 
value of the production system chain and has the ability to innovate processes, products and services. With successful 
implementation of the whole digital manufacturing chain benefits can range to 25% (de Boer et al. 2022).  
According to market research carried out by Precedence Research and Market Research Future the global market for 
Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing is expected to grow by 2025 at a CAGR of 33.5%., hit 30+ billion USB by 
2030 and increase 10 fold by the year 2030 (Dhapte 07/2023; Precedence Research 2023). This market consists of 
30% software solutions, 50% hardware products, and 20% services. Theses software includes packages, include 
IoT-platforms, products as well as industry specific niche applications. For instance, the predictive maintenance and 
machinery inspection segment is estimated to gain a significant market volume by 2032. The hardware segment 
consists of edge devices, Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and other Machine Learning (ML) specific hardware 
dedicated for shopfloor usage. Especially the computer vision segment is expected to expand fast. 
The current adoption rate is high, but as with any emerging technology, there are challenges that must be addressed 
to ensure a successful implementation. This paper will first discuss the challenges, afterwards in chapter 3 present the 
Use cases and in the chapter 4 show the manufacturing specific deployment of AI/ML models. 
2. Manufacturing specific Challenges of AI Implementation
Challenges hinder the swift adoption or cause implantation project to fail entirely. These challenges can be categorized 
into data preparation and data quality, complexity of processes, maintenance and repair of AI systems, data privacy

3.3 AI Use Cases at the System Level 
 
At the system level typical objectives are design resilient production systems, efficient logistics and material flow, 
optimized throughput and flexibility, optimized resource utilization. Implementing AI at the system level has typical 
use cases such as planning and scheduling the production of IPPS, design of manufacturing systems and work 
management with AI. One specific optimized resource utilization is system wide monitoring and optimization of 
energy usage. A study carried out to get data basis for ROI determination of individual energy efficiency measures 
found a reduction of energy consumption by 28% within the case scenario (Juergen Lenz, Kotschenreuther, and 
Westkaemper 2017). Implementing AI at the system level can lead significant to reduction of GHG emissions from 
industry between, increase of workforce that has basic digital skills, and reduction of training duration for human 
robot interaction. Also, the decision-making time can be reduced up to 60%. 
 
4. Key Takeaways and Outlook 
 
There were many recent breakthroughs in academia in regard to artificial intelligence, such as new algorithm designs 
and more efficient training. And many successful applications of AI in manufacturing have been demonstrated. The 
overall industry market for AI in manufacturing is growing fast and a 10-fold market increase is expected until 2030.  
An AI application consist of an AI-method which enables features and capabilities, in order to fulfill a use case 
objective. Use cases can be grouped into their level of autonomy and their manufacturing specific objective. Examples 
show significant improvement on all levels within a factory by applying AI-based applications.

Abstract 
This paper describes a case study of a single-family home to apply Six Sigma Problem Solving Methods and 
tools to reduce the electricity Bill and usage. The goal of the project was to identify and implement 
improvements that would reduce electricity usage and hence reducing electricity bill. The project team applied 
the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) problem solving approach. Six Sigma is 
a framework to improve performance Process or Tasks. The author of the paper has been working on the topic 
over the past 1 year. The author was able to reduce the electricity bill by 50-60% by making some proper 
research and lifestyle change. The highest bill that was noted is $135 a month and lowest after performing the 
control measures came down to $57 a month.

1.Introduction
In the US, individuals use a lot of energy on a daily basis. Whether they are driving, going to work, or relaxing 
at home, they are always consuming energy. Understanding how energy consumption can affect a person’s day-
to-day life is very important. This can be a huge financial burden for both homeowners and renters. High energy 
use can affect a person's overall well-being and finances, and it can also impact the environment. This paper 
aims to identify the behaviors and items that can lead to higher energy consumption. Although a home's 
upgrades or large purchases can increase its efficiency, it's also possible for an average household to reduce 
their energy consumption without major capital investment. For instance, by implementing simple changes in 
their 
daily 
schedule, 
they 
can 
lower 
their 
energy 
consumption. 
(Egli  
2020). 
With expanded population boom and 
rising 
living 
standards, 
residential electricity consumption 
as continued to develop over the decades. Gaining a better appreciation of household electricity consumption 
patterns, 
behaviors, 
and family traits that have 
an 
impact 
on consumption ought 
to 
prove 
exceptionally useful to policy- makers and electricity era corporations in growing agreeable techniques to limit 
residential electricity consumption. (Guo et al. 2016). Even though there is great amount of research on 
residential electricity utilization, some obvious deficits can be observed. For one, most of the studies failed to 
widely investigate connections between residential electricity patterns and interactions among key drivers, 
including time-related factors (e.g., season, month, day, hour) (McLoughlin et al. 2015). 
Future energy supply and use is one of the important decisions United States needs to think about. In what way 
renewable energy resources might be used to meet U.S. energy needs in general, and to meet U.S. electricity 
needs specifically is a fundamental question. Three general types of applications of Renewable energy sources 
are typically used for electricity generation, biofuels/bioproducts, and heating/cooling. These Respective 
application uses variety of technologies to convert renewable energy sources into usable products. Massive 
literature on renewable energy resources, conversion technologies for these diverse applications, is available. 
(Br, Wh., 2011). At utility-scale electricity generation facilities in the United States about 4,243 billion kilowatt 
hours (kWh) (or about 4.24 trillion kWh) of electricity was generated in 2022. Fossil fuels like coal (828 billion 
kWh i.e., 19.5%), natural gas (1689 billion kWh i.e., 39.8%), petroleum (23 billion kWh i.e., 0.6%), and other 
gases (12 billion kWh i.e., 0.3%) generates about 60% of this electricity generation. About 913 billion kWh 
that consists of 22% was from renewable energy sources and about 772 billion kWh that is about 18% was from

This electricity bill reduction project has been extremely successful in reducing the electricity bill in a single-
family home and is already giving results by reducing the bill by 50% from the initial bills when they moved 
in single family home. This showed great results as a lean six sigma application solving problem. Household 
members first Identified project problem, measured and assessed the possible root causes, implemented the 
possible improvement solutions, and evaluated results in terms of bill amount reduction, applied control plan 
to continuously maintain the reduced billing amount. There were several critical elements in the improvement 
process like monitoring thermostat, using dynamic timing, utilizing smart appliances and weatherizing the 
home every season. Using less hot water also played a vital role in controlling the usage. Getting the smart 
thermostat for free was a great help in keeping the electricity usage low. The project would not have been 
successful if the family members were not attentive enough and keen on finding information and ways in 
reducing the usage. This case study exhibits that six sigma techniques can be used and implemented in everyday 
life also and eliminate waste.  
 
5. Recommendation 
Electricity bill consisted of a good amount of the budget by making few lifestyle changes, some research and 
little investment this expense can be control affecting the monthly budget.

Abstract 
Due to the advancement of modern industrial processes, a considerable number of measured variables enhance the 
complexity of systems, progressively leading to the development of multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) methods 
to exploit valuable information from the collected data for predictive modeling, fault detection and diagnosis, such as 
partial least squares (PLS), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and their extensions. However, these methods suffer 
from some issues, involving the irrelevant information extracted by PLS, and CCA’s inability to exploit quality 
information.  Latent variable regression (LVR) was designed to address these issues, but it has not been fully and 
systematically studied.  
A concurrent kernel LVR (CKLVR) with a regularization term is designed for collinear and nonlinear data to construct 
a full decomposition of the original nonlinear data space, and to provide comprehensive information of the systems. 
Further, dynamics are inevitable in practical industrial processes, and thus a dynamic auto-regressive LVR (DALVR) 
is also proposed based on regularized LVR to capture dynamic variations in both process and quality data. The 
comprehensive monitoring framework and fault diagnosis and causal analysis scheme based on DALVR are 
developed. Their superiority can be demonstrated with case studies, involving the Tennessee Eastman process, Dow’s 
refining process and three-phase flow facility process.

1. Introduction
To assure the safe operation of industrial processes and the quality of their products, multivariate statistical analysis 
(MVA) has been extensively used for the purpose of predictive modeling (Gillo and Shelly 1976), fault detection and 
diagnosis (Qin 2003), and causal analysis (Peerally et al. 2017), which are critical for the enhancement of safety, 
reliability, and maintainability of industrial processes. When the collected data contains both process and quality data, 
supervised algorithms are preferred to fully exploit the information in the data, such as partial least squares (PLS) 
(Geladi and Kowalski 1986), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (Hardoon et al. 2004), and latent variable 
regression (LVR) (Zhu 2020). For instance, PLS maximizes covariances between input and output, but its extracts

Abstract 
In the era of Industry 4.0 where the world is changing fast, organizations are faced with the challenge of constantly 
changing their business operations to maintain competitiveness. It is imperative to carefully assess the contribution of 
various human factors in successful navigation through change. Organizations rely on change managers to spearhead 
change projects to ensure the realization of operational and organizational objectives. Change managers need relevant 
skills, knowledge and practical experience to ensure that they execute their change management duties effectively and 
efficiently. Thus, this study aims to examine the competencies of change managers required for successful 
management of change. The investigation began by reviewing the literature on change managers and change 
management. After that, it adopted a job analysis desktop review to examine change managers’ job specifications in 
South Africa. The study was descriptive in nature. It has revealed and discussed several skills for change managers. 
This study contributes to teaching and learning, research, and industry application of change management. It can also 
assist practitioners involved in the practice of change management with skills to focus on in their career development.

1. Introduction
Since change is inevitable, from time to time, organizations are confronted with change. It is worse in the dynamic 
and uncertain era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The need for change in an organization can stem from external 
factors such as regulation or legislative factors, growing competition, and internal factors such as adopting new 
technology and strategic changes (Chatzoglou al al., 2017). It is further stated that during transition, it is very important 
to assess the impact of diverse human factors in the successful adoption and management of change initiatives. Now, 
Judge and Thomas (2009) estimated that about 70% of initiatives of organizational change fail. Some change 
initiatives are very complex and challenging and often require some behavioral changes from employees. According 
to Rafferty and Jimmieson, (2016) there is an inherent resistance to change on the side of employees which contributes 
to the failure of change initiatives. Thus, there’s a need for highly skilled change managers or project managers with 
change management skills to assist organizations navigate through change. These change managers empower action 
through their leadership skills and also motivate employees to change through engagement and involvement. Change 
management has always been left in the hands of project managers or program managers depending on the structure 
of the organization. However, project managers, or project managers assigned with roles and responsibilities for 
change management are not always fit for the demands of organizational change projects (Crawford and Nahmias, 
2010). There are common skills that have been documented in literature, however they do differ in some instances. 
Project management skills have also been viewed as an important set of skills required by change managers (Oswick 
and Robertson  2009). Fewer studies focus on the competencies of change managers in the South African context. 
Hence, this study aims to assess the change managers' skills preferred for the South African context as a developing 
country.  
Objectives 
•
To examine the competences or skills required by change managers for successful management of change.
•
To conduct a job analysis on the job specifications so as to identify and analyze the change manager’s skills
within the South African context.

6. Conclusion 
The aim of the study was to identify and assess the competences or skills required by change mangers to successfully 
lead organization through change. The paper identified, presented and discussed a number of competences required 
by change managers. Change managers play a significant role in assisting organizations to navigate through change.  
The study also looked at the education levels required for change managers as well as their field of study. It then 
looked into the years of experience that change managers need to have. This was done because education and years 
of experience have a considerable impact on the leadership skills necessary for change management.   
The analysis of job specifications might not give results that can be generalized beyond the South African context, but 
it allowed a rigorous process to identify and analyze the competences for change managers. This study made 
contributions to the research of change management by stimulating the debate and discussions. It also made 
contribution in the practice of change management, as well as providing concepts to be incorporated in teaching and 
learning.  
Future studies may focus on the quantitative surveys to solicit the views of change managers within their practice. It 
might also focus on doing the job analysis based the practical job one is doing on daily basis to manage change. 
Finally, the future studies may also look into the engineering sector to confirm if they rely on technical project 
managers for change management or if they understand the role of change management in change projects.

Assessing the Maintenance Strategies and Techniques Used 
in South African Power Plants: A Review

Abstract 
As part of the energy sector, power plants are vital to fulfilling any state's social and economic needs. To fulfill these 
needs, power plants should adopt effective maintenance practices. This ensures the reliability and availability of power 
plant assets, thereby enhancing productivity and safety. This paper aims to identify, analyze, and present maintenance 
strategies and approaches adopted in South African power plants. South Africa has relationships with various countries 
across the globe; hence they are paying attention to its energy and other sectors. South African power plants have been 
struggling for over a decade to have a stable power supply system. One of the critical issues is maintenance. Efforts 
have been made to enhance the maintenance of power plants. The study adopted a narrative literature review of various 
scholarly writings to identify and assess the extent to which maintenance strategies are used in power plants. Several 
maintenance strategies have been adopted in South African power plants, such as preventive maintenance, predictive 
maintenance, corrective maintenance, computerized maintenance management system, total production maintenance, 
and human factors in maintenance. This study will be helpful to researchers and maintenance practitioners cussing in 
the maintenance of power plants, especially in the South African context and developing countries.

1. Introduction
Power plants are the lifeblood of social and economic development for developed and developing states. Their 
reliability and availability have a significant contribution to the social and business success of any country. According 
to Olesen and Shaker (2020) thermal power plants are critical assets in the present energy technical systems 
(equipment and infrastructure) with a mandate to provide services, energy and heat to their respective customers while 
maintaining a stable grid. As the demands to move to renewable energy intensify, operators find themselves under 
serve pressure (Olesen and Shaker2020). This pressure can be due to sophisticated maintenance required for new 
power plants and challenging maintenance for older power plants. The maintenance personnel need to ensure that state 
of the art maintenance practices are adopted to ensure the availability and reliability of that power plants infrastructure 
and equipment. Developed countries have achieved considerable success in reducing failures of power plant 
equipment such as boilers through the implementation of predictive maintenance strategies (Gabonewe at al. 2021). 
However, power plants in South Africa, which is this study's main focus, are finding it very difficult to adequately 
predict failures because they rely more on traditional maintenance strategies. Eskom, a state owned entity, generates 
a greater proportion (over 90%) of South African Electricity.  
Majority of the South African power plants are coal-fired including the recently built huge Kusile (3200 MW) and 
Medupi (3970 MW) power plants. Asset management process of the South African power plants, especially Eskom 
should be able to provide the utilities adequate maintenance and management such that they are able to meet the 
consumption demands (Mutloane 2009). Regular maintenance can assist power plants to minimize the risks of 
unplanned shutdowns or failures. However, the challenge is to find an adequate maintenance strategy for huge and 
modern power plants infrastructures especially since they are faced by increase in burdening electricity demands 
(Schlunz and Van Vuuren  2012). In their study, Ndjenja and Visser (2015) discovered that many of the South African 
power plants had adopted a maintenance strategy that integrates a number of techniques such as time-based, run-to-
failure and to-failure and condition based maintenance. The development and implementation of the a strategy is

Based on Table 2, it is apparent that Preventive Maintenance is the dominating maintenance approach in South African 
Power Plants.  This is consistent with the finding of Mamabolo (2012) who stated that preventive maintenance 
dominates the maintenance efforts of the South African power plants.  
 
Predictive Maintenance and Risk Based Maintenance were also showing a strong presence. These result are consistent 
with Sibanda (2016) who found that Eskom (90% owner of South African power plants) in the past ten years they 
have adopted reliability improvement initiatives, Risked Based Optimization approach and recently Risk Based 
Inspection (RBI). The one with least presence was Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM). Consistent with the 
finding that there was no evidence of previous studies of RCM in South African power plants and this may be due to 
cost – a determining factor to using RCM (Sibanda, 2016).  It is encouraging to see the less presence of Breakdown 
Maintenance. Since according to Govender (2015) for several years South African power plants relied on corrective 
maintenance. Du Toit, (2014) also confirmed that maintenance in South African power plants has evolved over the 
years. The worrying factor was to see the Differed Maintenance which is a destructive approach for complex systems. 
Eskom deferred their planned maintenance in order to meet the electricity demand leading to several break-downs of 
various power plant systems on daily basis, thereby causing power crisis leading to “load shedding” (Govender, 2015; 
Petersen, 2016). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study identified and examined the maintenance strategies and techniques used in South African power plants. It 
was discovered that South African power plants use breakdown maintenance, preventive maintenance, predictive 
maintenance, computerized maintenance management system, risked based maintenance, total productive 
maintenance and human factors in maintenance. It is important to note that breakdown and preventive (time-based) 
maintenance were dominant maintenance approaches used in South African power plants. Hence, there is still a great 
challenge in South African power plants to ensure the reliability and availability of its assets to meet the electricity 
demands. This study made contribution in research by creating an agenda for discussion and debates within the power

plant maintenance area, especially focusing on developing countries. It also discussed some of the challenges that are 
experienced when implementing these strategies. These challenges were related with leadership, training and 
constrained energy system that fails to match the social and economic demands.  Like any other study, this study 
suffered limitations with regard to methodology and disappointingly absence of papers focusing directly on the use 
and review of the maintenance strategies. Many focused on the use and adoption of maintenance strategies.  Future 
studies can focus on assessing the use of these maintenance strategies to reap maintenance benefits by either using 
quantitative, mathematical and qualitative methods.

Abstract 
Human factors engineering aims to optimize socio-technical systems to enhance systems performance and human 
well-being throughout the systems lifecycle. The aviation industry is one of the sophisticated and influential industries 
that popularized human factors engineering principles in response to aircraft incidents and accidents. Now, there has 
been a slow pace in applying human factors in the lifecycle of socio-technical systems beyond the aviation industry. 
Lack of understanding of human factors benefits has been alluded to as one of the factors that hinder the application 
of human factors in other industries. A number of studies focus on the development and application of various human 
factors models, but there seems to be no study that adequately shortlists, discusses and presents the benefits of applying 
human factors. The aim of this paper is to uncover, examine and classify the benefits of applying human factors 
engineering principles in sociotechnical systems, especially in the era of 4IR. A narrative literature review 
methodology was adopted to analyze and synthesize various conference and journal articles on the application of 
human factors. The study revealed and classified the benefits of human factors according to performance, wellbeing, 
safety, quality, cost, and other operational benefits. The study's main contribution is making the benefits of applying 
HFE in various systems and processes visible to potential adopters and researchers involved in the application of HFE. 
Human factors such that they are visible to researchers and industry practitioners. Thus, it sets an agenda for future 
debate, discussion and research.

1. Introduction
Human beings continue to contribute significantly in engineering systems' design, manufacturing, operation, 
maintenance and programing. In the era of The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) there are new interactions between 
human and technology/systems. Thus, there is a serious need to continue researching and addressing human factors 
engineering (HFE) in relation with technology, engineering systems and processes. Human factors are key to 
industrialisation, specifically in moments there is an occurrence of new levels of interconnection between humans, 
machines, materials and objects or interconnections in a socio-technical system (Longo et al. 2021). It is in the nature 
of human to make errors. In a technical setting these errors occur during the design, manufacturing, 
installation/assembly, inspection, operation and maintenance phase (Dhillon & Liu  2006). It is believed that system 
failures, incidents and accidents that stem from human errors constitute bout 70-80% (NOPSEMA 2015; Wiegmann 
and Shappell 2003; Pons and Dey  2015). HFE was established to with a human-centred approach to design, operate 
and maintain equipment, technology, systems, processes and procedures.  HFE is viewed as “the scientific discipline 
concerned with the understanding of the interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession 
that applies theory, principles, data, and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system 
performance” (International Ergonomics Association  2018). The studies and initiatives on human errors and HFE 
have made a considerable contribution that has led to enhancement of safety, quality, well-being and productivity 
(Long at al.  2021). A detailed analysis and presentation of benefits of HFE application will be discussed in detail 
under literature review. 
HFE is based on a system approach that focusses on the environment under which human operate with the intention 
to develop defenses to avoid errors or alleviate their impact (Reason, 2000). It is widely believed that human factors 
and ergonomics studies and application took effect during World War II (Wickens and Hollands, 2000). However,

It was observed in Figure 2, that 100% of papers that explicitly listed the benefits of applying human factors in socio-
technical systems mentioned system’s performance as a benefit. Of these papers, 93% mentioned human wellbeing, 
73% quality and 60% safety. These are in line with several definitions and objectives of human factors or human 
factors engineering stating that, human factors engineering aims to improve human-system relationship, thereby 
enhancing performance, well-being, quality and safety (International Ergonomics Association, 2018; Long at al., 
2021; Vijayakumar et al., 2021).  Then cost and other operational benefits scored 40% and 47% respectively.  Future 
studies should look closely to cost benefits since cost reduction is one of the aspects that get scrutinized during the 
adoption of interventions or new ways to doing work.  Figure 2 below presents the classification of benefits of HFE.

6. Conclusion 
This study reports on the review of literature on the application of HFE in socio-technical systems, specifically the 
studies that listed and demonstrated the realization of the benefits of the successful application of HFE. The study 
classified the benefits of applying HFE according to system performance, human well-being, safety, quality, cost, and 
other operational benefits. System performance, well-being, quality and safety scored high on the benefits of applying 
human factors. In contrast, cost and other operational benefits scored low. Cost benefit should be given careful 
attention in the studies of HFE since it plays a significant role when deciding on an intervention or new ways of doing 
work. The papers that formed part of the review incorporated HFE aspects in digital systems, technology, Industry 4.0 
technologies, lean management, manufacturing, maintenance, design, workstations and layouts, production logistics, 
etc. They demonstrated a need to continue pursuing studies in the field of HFE for future industries. At the pinnacle 
of the Industry 4.0 discussions, many people held a notion that Industry 4.0 technologies would replace human. 
However, it is evident that in the future of work there is still a considerable role to be played by human. Thus, 
determining interconnections between human and technology and managing these interconnections well would be key 
to success of organizations. The use of HFE specialists would also be necessary on the basis that there is still a rare 
integration of digital elements with HFE as well application of HFE in various industries. The study made the 
following propositions for future research: 
 
• 
Making a comparative study between organizations that have adopted HFE and those that have not to 
determine significant differences.

Abstract 
The subject of our senior design project is optimized product packaging. Companies may generally have trouble 
packing goods of various types, sizes, and volumes. The amount of waste produced by using cardboard and the precise 
arrangement and dimensions of the boxes to be used in order packaging are the two most significant issues related to 
the packaging issue. Random packaging, the use of parcels, and the absence of a set packaging sequence or rule result 
in wasteful cardboard usage, transportation space consumption, and financial loss because each parcel utilized has a 
cost. The boundaries and restrictions of the challenge were established after an analysis of potential packaging 
problems faced by the company. Before modeling, there has been literature research. Since we can use restricted 
amount of different sized boxes the main purpose of the model is to minimize the total volume with providing the 
information about which order should be placed on which box and in which order. Since the real data set is so large, 
the heuristic box packing algorithm is developed and its output data is used to decide the packaging orders into boxes.

1. Introduction
Xxx Logistics is a mixed logistics company that earns the most of its revenue in warehousing and road transportation. 
It provides freight transportation for warehouses and online purchases from top Turkish businesses. During our trip to 
their facility, they informed us about not having an e-commerce order packing system. 
Each brand's sections of the warehouse are separated. Each item is assigned a code and placed on the shelves in that 
order. When the order is received, the officer collects the items and sends them to be wrapped. The items in the order 
are sorted to fit into one of the 10 boxes that the packing officer deems suitable. As a result, more cardboard is needed, 
and the package occupies more room in the conveyed vehicle because this does not demonstrate the ideal sequence 
and outcome. 
In this project, we prepared the orders as rectangular prisms and we determined that according to the rule of having 
the minimum total volume. We applied the model we did for it, for small sized problems beside the big ones. You can 
see the detailed explanation of them in the following chapters. In this report, the volume of the boxes problem of Xxx 
Logistic will be discussed and solved. 
The problem is analyzed in detail, input data, iterative improvement, greedy resizing, box resizing, order transfer and 
optimization techniques are planned and a heuristics model based on the optimized box packing algorithm is developed 
and coded in Java. Detailed explanation and comparison about the results are made in the following chapters.  
2. Literature review
Most of the work that was accomplished during this term was focused on improving the model that was constructed 
during the previous term and reducing the complexity that were observed. Because of this, the articles “A New 
Mathematical Model for a 3D Container Packing Problem”, (Ocloo et al. 2020)  and “A Global Optimization Method 
for Packing Problems”, (Hu et al. 2002) which we have investigated in depth throughout the first term and presented 
in our first report played an extremely important role in the creation of our first step linear model in the chapter 3.4.1. 
To create the constraints (1-13) and the constraints (17-19), we have benefitted from these articles. During this time,

our algorithm can usually produce near-optimal solutions for a wide range of problem instances while maintaining a reasonable level 
of computational efficiency. 
 
*In addition, our algorithm proved to be an accurate method for one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems and provided optimal 
solutions for examples of such problems. This demonstrates the adaptability and dependability of our algorithm when dealing with 
different dimensions of the Box Packing Problem. 
Overall, the verification and validation process demonstrated that our algorithm effectively reduces the total number of crates used 
for order packaging while maintaining efficient search space exploration. Our algorithm contributes to more efficient and 
environmentally responsible supply chain practices by minimizing the total volume of cartons used.  
 
 
5. Implementation 
There is no requirement for additional data or resources for deployment. We have enough information that our 
organization has provided to us. We can choose from orders of the cardboard type. For each order, a new sort of 
cardboard will be used. Because there are just a few different kinds of cardboard, we built this model to determine if 
the products in an order will fit in the cardboard that will be utilized in that particular order. The ideal answer will 
then be obtained when we run this model.  
After the greedy algorithm we developed, we created a solution that will overcome the problem we want to solve. Our 
solution can be easily adapted to daily life and gives visible results. As we mentioned earlier, our main focus in this 
semester is to simplify the model we developed in IE401 and reduce computational complexity. In this direction, we 
created a two-stage model in which we developed our own algorithm to satisfy the needs of the company. Xxx 
company can run the two-stage method we have developed by putting the data it wants into it. In the first stage, the 
rectangular box in which the items will be located is minimized for the second stage and turns it into an input. The 
company can solve the problem by reaching the optimal number of boxes specified at the end of the second stage. Our 
solution will ensure that the problem reaches a conclusion without requiring any resources when the necessary data is 
provided. 
Our method computes the results with the expected speed and ease in accordance with the targeted and planned 
situation. The problem that may be encountered during the application of this method is that in the presence of very 
large and complex data, it may deviate from the optimal result. In smaller sizes, we observed that the optimality gap 
was approximately 1.72% on average when we selected 10 random orders and ran them in 3 boxes. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
6.1 Summary of the Work Done 
As previously indicated, the project's main focus was on issues with suitable packaging for online sales. A literature 
review, investigation, and in-depth handling and analysis of the problem were all done throughout the problem's 
solution phase. According to the principle of having the least total volume, we produced the orders for this project as 
rectangular prisms. Along with the larger challenges, we also used the model we developed for it to smaller issues. 
Input data, iterative improvement, greedy resizing, box resizing, order transfer, and optimization techniques are 
planned, and a heuristics model built on top of the optimized box packing algorithm is created and programmed in 
Java. The problem is thoroughly evaluated.  
 
6.2 Conclusion 
To determine the packaging orders into boxes, we designed the optimum box packing algorithm and used its output 
data. We employed iterative improvement, greedy search, and local search to create the optimized box packing 
algorithm. The goal of performing these searches is to identify the order packaging into boxes that comes the closest 
to being ideal. We sought to reduce the overall volume of orders that would be placed in a constrained number of 
boxes of various sizes. To tackle the issue, we examined the supplied data, and we programmed the algorithm in Java. 
To sum up, after collecting all the necessary data and information from the company and visiting the company, the 
problems were identified and made organized and resolved by using the necessary assumptions and creating the 
necessary algorithm.

Abstract 
The business environment is very competitive today. To stay afloat, organisations are always trying to achieve 
competitive advantage. It is argued that CSR can contribute to creating competitive advantage of organisations. 
Despite the contribution competitive advantage bring to firms, there are not many studies that have related CSR in 
SMEs and its impact on the competitive advantage attained. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of CSR 
activities on the competitiveness of SMEs operating in the retail sector in Ndola.  The sample size for the research 
was 360 SME owner and employed managers. A total of 263 managed to fill in the questionnaires to provide the 
empirical data needed for analysis. Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The key findings of the 
research were that economic responsibility was a determinant of competitiveness while philanthropic responsibility, 
environmental responsibility and workforce-oriented responsibility were not. Policy makers can consider giving 
incentives such as tax break on money spent on CSR to encourage SMEs to undertaken CSR activities to improve the 
competitiveness of SMEs. The research thus recommends that CSR be fully implemented by SMEs in the retail sector 
in Ndola and other areas in order to improve their competitiveness.

Abstract 
The Multi-Sided Platforms (MSPs) play the role of the matchmaker between customers and service providers (i.e., 
two main entities of each MSP). To maximize the MSP’s service rate, in this research, by prioritizing the tasks 
offered to the service providers, it has been tried to propose a new scheduling plan using the results of

Appendix II: PROMPETHEE-II 
PROMPETHEE is a compromise approach that uses the preference function to choose the best choice. It is applied 
in a variety of disciplines. In general, this technique presents alternatives and criteria, converts qualitative 
indications into quantitative indicators, and weights the indicators so that the sum of the weights equals one. The 
PROMPETHEE-II technique is used. This approach assigns a numerical value to each choice. 
Due to the distance between the two alternatives, the preference function P is used to compare the two possibilities 
 and 
 in index k. That is, as demonstrated in Equations (B-9 and 10), it is dependent on the distance between the 
two possibilities.

Abstract 
The present paper discusses the problem of short-term supply chain planning for production and logistics operations 
in the chemical industry.  
Our contribution is threefold. First, we designed a model of a real-world production site, translating the constraints 
and realities of the field into a mathematical model that is simple enough to be tractable but sufficiently rich to support 
decision-making. Secondly, we formulated and solved this problem as a MILP using the CPLEX solver.  
Finally, we applied this model to the OCP Safi plant, a chemical industry site of OCP Group. Using the model, we 
performed a sensitivity analysis on a real-life data instance, in order to detect the bottlenecks and determine the 
production boundaries.  
The results revealed that increasing the capacity of some specific production units, but not all, is required to increase 
the volume that can be produced and delivered. Identifying these bottlenecks will help OCP Group make informed 
decisions on how to distribute the investment effort, in order to increase the performance of the whole supply chain.

1. Introduction
Efficient supply chain management (SCM) has emerged as a major challenge and a key lever for today's manufacturing 
companies to increase their performance and create value. SCM has become increasingly sophisticated as the supply 
chains today are more and more complicated, even complex, due to their globalization, their inclusion of various 
stakeholders, of a high number of products, and their customization to client requirements. 
Successful supply chain management relies on maintaining solid procedures, receiving the correct information at the 
right time, making accurate forecasting as well as right trade-offs, implementing a clear strategy in a transparent 
manner, and digitizing the various supply chain functions. To reflect this shift, a new term “Value Network,” has even 
been introduced, which refers to the set of connections between people, companies, or departments that benefit to 
value creation (Fender 2020); (Peppard and Rylander 2006); (Ferrary and Granovetter 2009). Responding to this 
complexity and high associated stakes, decision support tools are crucial to optimally design this value network on a 
strategic horizon, then plan, schedule, and execute operations on tactical and operational horizons.  
In this paper, we address the planning problem of one production site of the OCP group (formerly Office Cherifien 
des Phosphates), an industrial company specialized in the extraction, valuation, and commercialization of phosphate 
in Morocco.  
Over the last decade, OCP Group has been a leading exporter of phosphate and its derivatives all around the world. 
The group operates throughout the whole value chain, from rock mining to chemical processing of phosphoric acid 
and phosphate fertilizers. It plays a key role in the Moroccan economy by contributing strongly to its GDP, with a 
revenue of US$ 11.28 billion, and a Gross profit of US$ 6.93 billion in 2022 (OCP Group 2023).

6. Conclusions  
Setting up an advanced planning and scheduling (APS) solution in manufacturing and supply chains is key to the 
performance of industrial chemical complexes, allowing supply chain managers to synchronize thousands of resources 
including machinery, raw materials, inventories, logistics, in order to fulfill the demands of the customers. Moreover, 
as stated in McKinsey (2022), building a digital twin of the supply chain, and using it to run “what-if” scenarios, is an 
essential part of efforts to achieve structural resilience and to be able to run the business in a volatile context.  
 
In this paper, we propose such a tool for a chemical industry site, in a deterministic context. Our contribution lies 
firstly in the modeling of the real-life production site, translating the constraints, and the reality of the field into a 
mathematical model, simple enough to be solvent and rich enough to bring value. The purpose of this model is to 
determine the production, transportation, and demand satisfaction plan while taking into account a variety of 
production, transportation, storage, and demand-related constraints. The objective function considered aims to 
maximize the produced and delivered volume. Although our model was designed for the Safi site of the OCP group, 
the model is quite generic and could be applied to other process manufacturing production systems. Second, we solved 
this model with a MILP solver (CPLEX). Finally, using this model, we conduct numerical experiments on a real case 
study to examine our studied supply chain through a sensitivity analysis and to identify its boundaries and possible 
improvements.   
 
To this end, we have manipulated the function objective to maximize the delivered product, by considering an infinite 
demand. We ran the model and examined the dual prices linked to each resource capacity constraint (production and 
transportation units). In this step, we revealed that positive dual prices are only associated with the manufacture of 
phosphorus and granulation. Then, we investigated the associated units by raising their capacities and evaluating their 
effect on the delivered volume. As discussed in the previous section, an increase of 6.37% in phosphoric units’ capacity 
results in a gain of 7,797, while doubling the capacity of the TSP production lines results in a gain of less than 7,687 
in the total volume delivered. The results of our study provide valuable insights into the supply chain planning problem 
and support the policymakers in developing policies that support the growth of supply chain networks. 
 
Finally, there are several ways to enrich the model developed in this study. First, by integrating the scheduling plan 
for trains and trucks as well as loading and unloading vessels. Second, by incorporating real-time data on traffic, 
weather, and resource unavailability and propose methods to adjust the schedule. Another option would be to consider 
the stochastic version of the problem by harnessing historical data.

Abstract 
Through the last decades, energy consumption presented a continuous increase and became a fundamental asset in 
every sector. Considering heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC), improvements have been progressively 
required, mainly when circumstances are also influenced by geopolitical and economical aspects. The present work 
discusses an exergy analysis of two existing heat pump (HP) technologies, air-source and ground-source for heating 
and cooling operations. These may be used for the replacement of the system of a critical environment, a bioterium, 
which currently comprises chillers for cooling and boilers for heating to provide environmental conditions that must 
be uninterruptedly maintained, thus requiring substantial energy consumption. With the purpose of exploring less 
demanding alternatives, an exergy analysis is performed in this work to establish a comparison between the two 
aforementioned HP technologies using an algorithm executed in Python. For both equipment exergetic analyses, six 
different types of refrigerants are considered as well. In all scenarios, the ground-source HP presented a smaller 
exergy, alongside a considerably higher exergetic efficiency due to a smaller exergy destruction and a higher 
coefficient of performance (COP).

1. Introduction
Despite the improvements regarding HVAC equipment energy efficiency in the last 60 years, energy consumption 
increased more than 60% per person worldwide, from 12976 kWh in 1965 to 20902 kWh in 2021 (Ritchie et al. 2022). 
According to Delmastro et al (2022), from to 2010 to 2021, the energy consumed worldwide in buildings increased 
from 31944,4 to 37500 TWh, accounting thus, for about 30% of the total global energy consumption. In regard to this 
consumption, HVAC corresponds to a substantial part since from 2020 to 2021 space cooling presented the largest 
increase in electricity consumption in buildings, higher than 6.5%. Moreover, a more grievous concern in the matter 
of HVAC is space and water heating, as almost 50% of the consumed energy by buildings in 2021 was used for this 
effect. As heating demand is still supplied at approximately 64% by fossil fuels, only 42% as natural gas, its usage 
resulted in the direct emissions of about 2450 Mt of CO2 in the atmosphere (Goodson et al, 2022). In addition to 
decarbonisation, another aspect of space and water heating that cannot be neglected is the uncertainty of natural gas 
supply, since Russia, who once provided more than 50% of the gas in EU, was providing less than 13% by the end of 
2022 (European Council, 2022). 
A promising solution able to fulfil all the HVAC needs of the buildings is the replacement of the current systems, for 
both cooling and heating, by HP technologies. Such solution relies on the fact that HPs are a cleaner and more efficient 
technology (Delmastro et al, 2022). For this reason, their implementation has been progressively supported by several 
countries. Nevertheless, they supply only 10% of building heating needs in global terms. Consequently, the global 
market of HPs has presented a notable growth, with an increase that surpasses 13%. At the moment, air-source heat 
pumps (ASHP) represent the largest portion of the HPs market, with over 60% of the total sales. Meanwhile, ground-
source heat pumps (GSHP), despite their higher COP, represent a minor share of the global sales due to their higher 
costs and more disruptive installation (Delmastro et al, 2022) (Omer, 2008) (Staffel et al, 2012). 
In virtue of the continuous growth of this technology, it requires more research and more development. The choice 
between which HP technology to use must be analysed based on the application, budget, and availability of space for 
implementation. In the case of the present paper, the application for a critical environment, a bioterium, is considered.

5. Conclusion
The present work aimed to perform an exergy analysis for an air-source and for a ground-source heat pump considering 
six different refrigerants. The application under consideration is a bioterium, an environment that requires a continuous 
utilization of the HVAC equipment, either for cooling or heating, according to the thermal needs. Thus, both 
equipment were compared in terms of exergy efficiency for both functions. For the exergy analysis itself, an algorithm 
in Python was developed and employed. 
In terms of equipment, the GSHP detains less available exergy than the ASHP. Nevertheless, the exergy destruction 
rates were significantly smaller with the former, which led to higher exergetic efficiencies and COPs for both cooling 
and heating modes. The main reason for that is the greater thermal stability of the ground when compared to the air, 
which presents a substantial variability along the year. In addition, and as a consequence, to these temperature 
parameters, the work provided by the compressor is reduced, which also reduces the energy input and, therefore, the 
exergy available alongside its destruction.  
Since the exergy destruction is directly related to the entropy variation, the components with the highest exergy 
destructions were the compressor and expansion valve, except for R32 systems that must be further analysed. 
Nevertheless, the exergy destruction is also dependent on several thermodynamic and chemical properties of the 
refrigerant employed.  
Among the analysed fluids, the one with best results was the R134a, which is currently in phase out process due to its 
elevated global warming potential. In this manner, a promising alternative in the long term are the refrigerants R1234ze 
and R290, which despite presenting a mild flammability level, present a low global warming potential. The refrigerant 
with worst results was the R410A, which is also in phase out process due to its high global warming potential. The 
results are quite similar when it comes to the COP concerning each refrigerant, where R134a and R410A presented 
the highest and the lowest COPs, respectively. Nevertheless, the differences among all the refrigerants analysed were 
minimum. Moreover, in terms of COP, R290 also appears to be a promising alternative in the near future.  
In the future, more work will be developed, considering other refrigerants, applications, and systems with other 
components that may increase their COP, such as accumulators and liquid receivers.

Abstract 
As the market scale of fresh food e-commerce continues to expand and people's demand for various fresh foods 
increases, the last-mile distribution is the key point for the development of fresh food e-commerce. This paper would 
like to analyze 5 factors that affect the last-mile distribution of fresh e-commerce and to provide suggestions for the 
last-mile distribution of fresh food e-commerce enterprises and to propose optimization suggestions to help fresh food 
e-commerce enterprises adjust their future logistics development strategies in time, also to promote the stable
development, including consumer experience, warehouse operation, costs, waste, transportation and distribution. The
results showed that the main criteria affecting the last-mile distribution of fresh food e-commerce is costs, and its
average weight is 0.420, which indicates that the costs is the most important to promote the development of fresh food
e-commerce. The weight of transportation costs in sub-criteria is 0.240, which indicates that the transportation costs
of fresh food is important.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the fresh food retail market has been growing. People have a rigid demand for fresh food as one of the 
basic consumer goods, and with the increase of disposable income and consumer spending in life, the fresh food retail 
market is also expanding. Currently, with policy support, China has introduced a series of policies to encourage the 
development and innovation of fresh food e-commerce, especially to deal with the shortcomings of the ""initial and 
last mile cold chain logistics"", providing a clear direction for the development of the fresh food e-commerce industry. 
For example, the Chinese Ministry of Transport issued ""Implementation Opinions on Promoting High-Quality 
Development of Cold Chain Logistics Transportation” in 2022, which aims to innovate transportation service models,

Abstract 
The global outbreak of Covid-19 has had far-reaching effects on countries worldwide, influencing various aspects of 
life, economies, and markets. As a result of government policies, organizations have been compelled to adopt remote 
working arrangements. Within this context, the performance of employees becomes a crucial concern for 
organizations. To effectively navigate the pandemic and develop a capable and adaptable remote workforce, 
organizations need to prioritize the development of their human capital. Hence, this review paper focuses on exploring 
employee training during the Covid-19 period in Malaysia. The findings highlight the importance of training and 
development programs in successfully navigating the pandemic, as they offer numerous benefits and significantly 
influence employee performance.  A great shift to digitalization of training is noticed with 86% of the companies shift 
their training and development programs to online, 76% of the companies plan to increase their online training 
programs, and 68% found online training to be equally effective. However, organizations face specific challenges 
when implementing virtual training, including the inadequacy of traditional programs and methods, limited 
collaboration and engagement, difficulties in assessing training outcomes, and issues in sustaining trainees' 
participation. Additionally, the paper recommends that organizations explore and utilize existing training programs 
and technologies, while investing further in digitalization and virtual training initiatives.

1. Introduction
Developing employees' talents is crucial for achieving sustainable business growth and success due the hug huge 
transformation to remote work and technology. Companies typically invest significant time and resources in recruiting 
and onboarding competent staff, but many leaders neglect the importance of cultivating their employees' potential. In 
recent years, the onset of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has disrupted the 
world of work. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has brought about significant changes in the workplace due to 
the rapid integration of technological disruption and digital transformation. As a result, many businesses are finding 
it challenging to keep up with the pace of innovation. Additionally, there is a growing skills gap, which is why 
investing in employee training and development is crucial for both business growth and the workforce that drives it.

Abstract 
The purpose of the current manuscript is to discuss the application experiences of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) process 
improvement methodology in defect reduction. The work discussed in the manuscript pertains to the results that were 
obtained in the quality control improvement project of a Shade Net Manufacturing plant in Botswana, to eliminate 
product defects. The defects in this case, were defined as the snapping of the manufactured plastic threads used in the 
production of the shade nets. This snapping of the threads created holes on the knitted nets which also then led to 
inconsistencies in the knitted pattern of the nets. At any given month, these defects amounted to an average of 60% of 
the total production output which compounded to a yearly monetary loss of about US$290 250 to the company. Several 
LSS tools were applied within the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) process improvement 
methodology from defining the problem through control and up to recommendations that could eliminate the process 
defects. Tools such as SIPOC (Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Customer) diagrams, Process Maps, Cause and Effect 
diagrams, Process Capability Analysis, Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gage R&R), Multiple Linear 
Regression and Design of Experiments (DOE) were applied in the project.  Ultimately, a Failure Mode Effects 
Criticality Analysis (FMEA) was also produced which could help the company to maintain and control the process 
according to the recommendations that were produced. The main findings of the study revealed through regression 
analysis was that four major process variables affected the tensile strength of the threads, and this led to the observed 
defects. Through DOE the optimal settings of these variables were identified, and the tensile strength was observed to 
increase by 9.1% from an average of 35.8718 MPa to 39.1269 MPa. This result also led to a significant defect reduction 
from 60% to only 0.025% of the total production output and a jump in the process sigma level from 1.25 to 4.98.

of a dependent variable is the same in two related groups. It evaluates the before and after of a situation, treatment, or 
condition. A paired t-test analysis ran at an alpha value of 0.05 returned a p-value of 0.001 indicating that there is a 
statistically significant difference between means of before the optimal settings treatment and the after optimal settings 
treatment of the tensile strength values. Therefore, this showed a significant improvement on the tensile strength values 
of the threads. It was decided to then run another process capability analysis test on the tensile strength values and 
Figure 8 shows the results that were obtained. 
 
 
 
Figure 8: Tensile Strength Process Capability Analysis Of Optimum Settings Data 
 
From Figure 8, the process capability output indices, Cpl and Cpk are equal to 1.66, the figure is above the standard cut 
off 1.33 which indicates that the process is now capable. The process has a lower specification limit of 35.5 Mpa but 
does not have an upper specification limit since achieving a high tensile strength is more than desirable. It can be 
noted that no values fall below the lower specification limit. From the Cpk of 1.66, the new process sigma level is now 
4.98 (Cpk×3= 1.66×3= 4.98). Using the 4.98 sigma level the new DPMO was derived as 250.75 and DPU of 0.00025. 
Deriving percentage defects calculations from the DPMO the process now has an average percentage of defects of 
0.025% which is far much smaller than the initial 60% defect production which the company was experiencing at the 
beginning of the project. 
 
3.4 Improve 
 
Following the results obtained and the analysis done, a Solution Selection Matrix (SSM) was employed to formulate 
a cost-effective solution to solve the observed problem. The proposed solutions followed from the analytical findings 
that were obtained from the DOE investigation and a brainstorming exercise with the production team. It was observed 
that to effectively control the Motor Speed, Annealing Temperature and Barrel Heat, there were no major investments 
that would to be made into the current production process, but there will be a need to make some adjustments to the 
equipment used for controlling the Quenching Temperature. It was observed that there will be need to get a larger 
water tank more than 2 500 L than the current one that the company used. This conclusion was made because according 
to Rajan et al (2018), quenching for continuous processes that take material greater than 25 kg for more than 5 hours 
directly from an extruder require water volume that is larger than 3 000 L assuming an initial water temperature of 
room temperature 26-27 degrees Celsius.

To sustain the process improvements that could be achieved by utilizing the recommendations from the study, an 
FMEA was constructed that also took into consideration all the other process steps of producing a shade net and Risk 
Priority Numbers (RPN) values were calculated. Apart from the four variables that were identified to be critical by 
multiple linear regression and DOE, the knitting step showed to be the most critical to be also managed closely. The 
potential failure of this process step could also lead to improper knitting structure of the shade nets even if all the other 
variables as identified have been effectively managed and controlled. The cause of the failure being due to threads not 
being inserted properly in all the needles used for knitting the shade net. The recommended action for this was for the 
company to investigate the use of pressure sensors that could detect that all threads has gone through the all the needles 
successfully. It was also suggested that the company invest in a quality control system that could employ the use of 
Statistical Process Control charts and collect a minimum of 15 samples to be tested at the end of each shift every day 
at the beginning. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The current manuscript discussed the application of Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology in solving a real-life 
practical problem by careful selection of the LSS tools and the systematic procedure of utilizing these tools throughout 
the life of a project.  Production challenges that were experienced by the case study company were fully investigated 
and a solution was developed and piloted for a week, which led to significant achievement being realized. The 
approach adopted in the study and solutions recommended can be applied to similar processes to potentially reduce 
production defects in similar settings. For a follow up similar study, there might be a need to also include in the 
parameters to be investigated the residence time of the material in the quenching and annealing media process steps.

Abstract 
Study determination is to deliver a framework for overpowering the obstacles headed digital readiness of the 
organizations, which are not prepared for upcoming industrial difficulties. Interrelated theoretical lens of 
contextual leadership theory and strategic alignment model along with data analysis of 279 top manager from IT 
sector in Pakistan. Result examination shows that organizational optimizations including top management 
commitment, strategic planning and inter-organizational collaboration mediates the relationship between digital 
leadership and firm’s digital readiness. Study consumes significant professional and theoretic suggestion that no 
matter how strong is the leadership, means through which the desire outcome could be achieve should not be 
ignore. 
Key words 
Digital leadership, big data strategic planning and Strategic alignment model.
1. Introduction
Global trade analysis through the lens of contextual leadership theory acknowledges that leader’s art of behaving 
according to the context is in demand like never before. Industry is approaching towards fourth industrial 
revolution that is branded by digitalization of business process. G7 countries comprises of Canada, EU, France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US issued a signed declaration with a vision to place technology at the heart of 
global efforts to digitalize outdated paper-based systems from global trade to serve the customers effectively and 
efficiently MP (2021). UK digital secretary Oliver Dowden said G7 countries want to establish a convincing 
vision that how technology should support and enhance societies in the digital age. All the G7 countries have 
agreed to prioritize digital competition for digital revolution, developing framework addressing domestic reforms 
for digital transformation of organizations and collaboration among governments and stakeholder to support 
digital development (MP, 2021).  
1.1. Research Problem 
Highly active and responsive capabilities are observed in smart organizations. Survey based on hundreds of firm 
shows that the organizations, which are digitally ready to encounter the future demand of fourth industrial 
revolution earned 16% extra than the average net profit margin of the relevant industry (Weill & Woerner, 2018). 
Organizations which are not digitally ready to encounter future demands of fourth industrial revolution are most 
likely to suffer dramatically or even replace by agile competition and new start-ups (Weill & Woerner, 2018). 
This specific problem is challenging existence of all those organization which are not digitally ready. So pragmatic 
researcher should derive a frameworks, based on which organization can make a forward move towards digital 
readiness in true sense for meeting the future demand of industry 4.0 and can align themselves with G7 countries 
vision regarding digitalization. McAfee, Brynjolfsson, Davenport, Patil, and Barton (2012) claimed that in future 
successful firm will be those which are digitally ready. Awan et al. (2021) claimed that getting equipped digitally 
required alignment at strategic level, strategic alignment model also stresses that strategic alignment should be 
there for achieving the desire outcome (Henderson & Venkatraman, 1992). In current study scenario, desire 
outcome is digital readiness of firms involved in manufacturing and its export or import. Tijan, Jović, 
Aksentijević, and Pucihar (2021) has identifies some barriers including lack of vision, strategy, coordination and 
collaboration whereas success factors were also identified including actively shaping future strategies (strategic 
planning), clear vison, inter-organizational collaboration and digital leadership. Tijan et al. (2021) has explored 
the barrier and their potential remedial factors but a quantitative survey study is required to generate the 
generalizability of these factors. Most important success factor they have identified is digital leadership. Anak 
Agung Sagung and Sri Darma (2020) and Kane, Phillips, Copulsky, and Andrus (2019) claimed that digital 
leadership is all about transformative vision, forward locking and collaboration. Anak Agung Sagung and Sri 
Darma (2020) also claimed that digital leader add value in what we do, which represents it strategic mindset. 
Strategic mindset represents strategic planning of the leader that where the organization is and where it should be.

Another stage after confirming the mediation is to check the level of mediation aimed at which indirect effects is 
considered and found out that the indirect influence is highly significance in all cases whereas the direct effect of 
digital leadership on digital readiness is not significance due to lower β value. This designates full mediation of 
organizational factors including top management commitment, strategic planning and inter-organizational 
collaboration between digital leadership and digital readiness. 
Linking results with past study is not completely possible as there are not sufficient number of studies for linking 
the results. 
Table 4 Hypothesis Testing 
 
6. Conclusion 
Study is conducted for existence of those firms that are not in group of future ready organization. Study has 
projected a model through which, factories can be transform into smart factories for their existence. Data is 
collected commencing 279 top managers of the IT firms in Pakistan that. Structure equation modeling is applied 
with bootstrapping for mediation test, outcomes displays that organizational optimization including top 
management commitment, big data strategic planning and Inter-organizational collaboration is crucial for 
achieving firm digital readiness. These consequences derived through mediation test fulfil research objectives of 
examining the mediating part of these organizational optimization including top management commitment, big 
data strategic planning and inter-organizational collaboration Without addressing these organization factors digital 
readiness will not be achieve in its true sense and will remain a dream.

Abstract 
The United Nations has set in place sustainable development goals (SDGs) aimed at addressing problems such as 
those South Africa faces. One of South Africa’s challenges is the influx of people into her cities. This is also a global 
phenomenon, with 90% of the world’s population expected to migrate to and stay in cities by 2050. This study 
conducted a desk review in which 125 journal articles were reviewed and used for semantic analysis, creating a word 
cloud and word frequencies using Atlas ti. The study found support available for the country to ensure that smart cities 
are developed, with four smart-city projects in progress, and that the SDGs are being addressed. This study proposes 
the development of smart cities as a vehicle for addressing the SDG Agenda 2030. Eleven SDGs are addressed by the 
four smart cities that the country is working on. The study recommends that meaningful collaborations between private 
and government institutions be set up so that funding can be secured to fast-track the completion of these cities. Future 
research could look at how citizens can be better prepared for living in smart cities by being able to use the technology 
they offer.

1. Introduction
It is believed that by 2050 the world will have seen an increase of 2.5 billion people from Africa or Asia. Furthermore, 
90% of the population will be living in cities (Balkaran  2019). To meet the demands associated with large numbers 
of people moving to cities, city infrastructure will have to be increased by 60% (Hasbini  et al.  2018). Cities cover 
only 3% of the world’s surface area; however, they are considered to be the most populated areas. Despite the relatively

Abstract 
Traffic flow prediction plays a vital role in transportation planning, management, and control. Accurate predictions of 
traffic flow can greatly enhance traffic safety, alleviate congestion, and optimize the overall performance of 
transportation systems. The emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques has opened up new 
avenues for improving traffic flow predictions. This study investigates the potential of deep learning approaches in 
optimizing traffic flow and enhancing traffic management and prediction. The authors provide a comprehensive 
overview of the evolving deep learning techniques utilized for traffic flow prediction and analyze their advancements 
in the field. The study highlights the promising outcomes achieved through the application of deep learning models 
for forecasting traffic flow. However, it also acknowledges the limitations of individual deep learning models and 
emphasizes the increasing interest in hybrid and unsupervised techniques as viable alternatives. The findings 
underscore the need for continuous research efforts to develop and refine deep learning techniques for traffic flow 
prediction and to enhance traffic management systems. The study recognizes the implications of these findings for 
transportation planners, policymakers, and researchers who seek to leverage deep learning methods for optimizing 
traffic flow and improving transportation infrastructure.

1. Introduction
Since the introduction of motorized vehicles, heavy traffic and congestion have been major issues in urban settings, 
these issues can have a significant impact on society in various ways, such as financial losses due to lost time in traffic 
and environmental impacts from air pollution, fuel consumption, and other factors (Cohen and Dalyot 2019). In 
response to this issue, traffic monitoring and control solutions are being researched and implemented in many cities 
worldwide. These solutions involve using sensors, cameras, and other technology to gather information about traffic 
flow and alert authorities of any issues or areas where traffic may need re-routed or adjusted (Pfülb et al. 2019). Such 
solutions have been proven effective in reducing traffic congestion and its associated consequences, leading to more 
efficient transportation, fewer environmental emissions, increased road safety, and improved quality of life for those 
who use the roadways. The ultimate goal of traffic monitoring and control is to reduce the overall impact of traffic on 
the environment, economy, and citizens while increasing the efficiency of transportation and road safety (Bao et al. 
2021). Predicting traffic flow has been a long-standing issue in the literature, employing various modeling approaches. 
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have gradually replaced traditional statistical methods for traffic 
prediction (Nakatsuji et al. 2002). Numerous studies have investigated using machine learning (ML) to model traffic 
patterns with varying degrees of success. However, most traditional ML-based approaches have not uncovered 
significant correlations in traffic data. This article critically evaluates the current research on deep learning (DL) 
methods to improve traffic management and prediction. It discusses the various DL models proposed for this purpose 
and explores their potential for future applications. The paper provides an overview and synthesis of recent 
advancements in applying deep learning to traffic management and control. A range of methods employed in the 
examined studies are discussed and characterized. This paper also reveals the dataset used in each study's analysis and 
the specific context of traffic management and prediction on which the study was based.

Abstract 
The global population is estimated to increase by 2.6 billion by 2050, in which 70% of the world's population will be 
staying in the cities. Countries will have to introduce solutions to traffic congestion, pollution, and security. South 
Africa is not immune to the global challenges and the rise in population. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Smart Transport Systems in developing countries. The study used a qualitative approach, and scoping 
research methodology technology to review the papers published between 2015-2021, which were specifically 
concentrated on South African smart cities and transport. Articles relating to smart cities and transport in South Africa 
were intensively reviewed and 250 papers were selected. It was found that despite the challenges which South Africa 
as a country is facing, relating to the socio-economic, its initiatives are gradually developing especially in different 
metropolitan municipalities which are leading to very successful projects in both the public and the private sector. 
South Africa does have smart transport infrastructure in place which gives a good kick start and development of smart 
transport. However, good monitoring, evaluation, and planning of the current infrastructure are of great importance.

Abstract 
Small scale poultry producers play a significant role in South Africa to fight unemployment and to address the problem 
of food insecurities. This study focuses on the use of Power BI by small-scale poultry producers in South Africa. The 
purpose of this study is to explore if Power BI can be used to do big data analytics to address supply chain management 
issues. This study addressed the research question and two objectives. This study followed the Design Science 
Research to address the research question. Ten people were interviewed to confirm the usability of the dashboarding 
too. The dashboard was created and this led to the analysis of the data and predictions of data. All that data can be 
used for supply chain management in a small-scale poultry producer. It was found that the Power BI tool works and 
it is easy to use. It is recommended that there is a collaboration between institutions of higher learning and government 
departments that support small businesses. These two can collaborate to provide financial and non-financial support 
to small-scale poultry producers. Further study will focus on the use of Power BI to mine and analyse social media 
data for small-scale poultry producers.

Abstract 
The world is rapidly and increasingly becoming digital, with over 90% of the data that exists worldwide created since 
2010. This process was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw people being housebound and forced to 
engage online and, in this way, increased e-commerce. This led to the massive amounts of data that are being added 
daily. Governments, institutions and big companies mine, refine, store and analyse data, which they use for decision-
making and as the basis for innovation and increased profitability. Unfortunately, many small- and medium-scale 
enterprises (SMEs) are unable to take advantage of the big data that is available to them. SMEs play a pivotal role in 
growing the economy of developing and emerging markets. In South Africa, over 98% of businesses fall under the 
category of SMEs; they account for over 45% of the country’s gross domestic product; and they employ over 60% of 
the total labour force. SMEs face several challenges that hinder them from appreciating and using big data analytics. 
These include a lack of data-science skills and insufficient finances for purchasing the necessary infrastructure and 
employing appropriately skilled personnel for conducting data analytics. The purpose of this study was to develop a 
road map for SMEs to follow in adopting and implementing big data analytics. The study adopted a sequential mixed 
method and a pragmatic philosophical stance. The study began by conducting a bibliometric analysis to understand 
the challenges faced by SMEs concerning big data analytics and to understand what had been studied thus far, by 
whom and where. A total of 494 articles, books and documents were sourced from the Scopus database for the years 
2005 to 2022. VOSviewer and Python were used as tools to mine and analyse the data. The presentation of the data 
led to the identification of the Power BI tool as potentially useful, based on two studies that recommended the use of 
this tool by SMEs for big data analysis. Power BI was adopted and used to create a dashboard for analysis. Experiments 
were conducted on data obtained from a small-scale poultry producer that was selected using convenience sampling. 
Ten people were used to confirm the usability of the artefact (dashboard) in interviews, after they had been trained on 
how to use the tool. The interviews were analysed using ATLAS.ti and the results of the different data-analysis 
methods were triangulated. This study followed the Technological Organisational Environmental (TOE) theory 
framework as the base for adopting and implementing big data analytics using the Power BI tool. The tool was found 
to be working and user-friendly to SMEs and to respond to the problems faced by SMEs such as the lack of skills and 
finances as it is freely available. This study recommends that a collaboration be formed between government 
departments that support SMEs and institutions of higher learning to work together to help SMEs. SMEs need to be

1. Introduction
In today's world, the growing global demand for renewable energy has led to a revived interest in using biomass as a 
sustainable and carbon-neutral alternative. Biomass, derived from organic materials like agricultural residues, forestry 
waste, and dedicated energy crops, possesses immense potential for energy production (Jungmeier 2017; Onu and 
Mbohwa 2021). However, traditional methods of biomass energy production often face challenges related to 
efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact (Jungmeier 2017; OECD/IEA and IRENA 2017). In recent 
years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative technology capable of revolutionizing various 
industries (Wu et al. 2018). ML algorithms have the ability to analyze vast volumes of data, identify patterns, and 
make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Applying ML techniques in biomass energy production 
opens up new possibilities for optimizing processes, enhancing efficiency, and improving overall system performance 
(Cinar et al. 2022). By harnessing the power of ML, we can unlock numerous potential benefits, including improved 
resource utilization, increased energy conversion efficiency, and enhanced operational decision-making. These 
advancements have the potential to expedite the adoption of biomass as a reliable and sustainable energy source, 
ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. To achieve this, 
modern technologies for bioenergy and bioproduct production offer promising avenues. Bioenergy involves producing 
energy from organic materials such as crops, agricultural residues, and organic waste, while bioproducts encompass a 
wide range of products derived from biomass, including bioplastics, biochemicals, and biofuels.

challenges. 
 
4.4 Insight and Outlook 
In conclusion, this study has explored the synergistic applications of machine learning (ML) and bioenergy, shedding 
light on their integration and potential for environmental sustainability. The findings highlight the transformative 
capabilities of ML in optimizing bioenergy processes, enhancing efficiency, and improving overall system 
performance. According to the literature and through an overview of the case of Mukono, we have demonstrated the 
successful integration of ML in various aspects of bioenergy production, including biomass characterization, process 
monitoring, and operational decision-making. The integration of ML techniques has led to significant improvements 
in bioenergy production, such as real-time anomaly detection, the prediction of equipment failures, and the 
optimization of operating conditions. These advancements offer opportunities for process optimization, efficiency 
improvements, and enhanced environmental sustainability in the bioenergy industry. The study has identified critical 
success factors for ML adoption in the bioenergy sector, including data availability and quality, development of 
specialized ML algorithms, computational resources, and interpretability of ML models. By addressing these factors 
and overcoming challenges, policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders can unlock the full potential of ML 
in advancing bioenergy production and achieving sustainable energy goals. 
 
The implications of this research are far-reaching. For policymakers, the study provides insights into the benefits and 
challenges associated with integrating ML in the bioenergy sector. It highlights the need for supportive funding 
initiatives and regulatory frameworks that incentivize ML adoption while ensuring transparency and accountability. 
Researchers can leverage the findings to guide further investigations into ML techniques tailored to the bioenergy 
domain and to explore additional areas for ML integration, such as supply chain optimization and market forecasting. 
Industry stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the potential of ML to enhance operational efficiency, reduce 
costs, and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future. Future research directions should focus on expanding 
the application of ML in bioenergy production and addressing emerging challenges. Further studies can explore 
advanced ML algorithms, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, to tackle complex bioenergy optimization 
problems. Additionally, investigating the socio-economic and policy implications of ML integration in bioenergy can 
provide a holistic understanding of its broader impact. 
 
5. Conclusions 
This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on ML and bioenergy integration. By harnessing the power 
of ML, the bioenergy sector can advance towards a more sustainable and efficient future, reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, mitigating climate change, and promoting environmental sustainability. Through collaboration, innovation, 
and continued research, the synergies between ML and bioenergy can pave the way for a cleaner and greener energy 
landscape.

Abstract 
Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a Lean tool that visualizes and analyzes the flow of materials, information, and value 
through a production process. It plays a crucial role in identifying areas of waste and lost value, enabling process 
redesign for more sustainable production. To align with the Circular Economy (CE) principles, a methodology called 
Circular Value Stream Mapping Methodology (C-VSMM) was developed, integrating VSM with CE concepts. The 
development of C-VSMM offers a valuable tool for organizations to improve production processes and progress 
towards sustainability. Additionally, a questionnaire was created through a semi-structured interview to help 
companies in identifying opportunities for improvement. This questionnaire enhances the methodology by providing 
a comprehensive understanding of processes and facilitating targeted improvements. The integration of Lean 
principles, particularly VSM, with the CE concept expands the application of VSM, enabling companies to pursue 
sustainability goals and improve production processes. Overall, the study presents the C-VSMM as a practical and 
theoretical contribution, empowering companies to adopt more sustainable practices and achieve production process 
improvements aligned with the CE.

1. Introduction
In a world where resources are limited, it is essential to move away from the traditional linear economic model and 
embrace a more sustainable approach. Circular Economy (CE) aims to keep resources in use for as long as possible, 
reduce waste and pollution, and regenerate natural systems. Targets can aid in the shift towards a CE through various 
means, such as minimizing waste, creating closed-loop production processes, optimizing resource utilization, and 
maximizing the economic value retention of materials and products (Morseletto, 2020). To achieve this, companies 
need to analyze their production processes carefully to identify opportunities to reduce waste, increase efficiency, and 
create value from waste products.

Abstract 
This summary provides an overview of the project methodology utilized in the Modeling and Simulation of Industrial 
Systems course, which is offered in the final year of the Industrial Engineering Program at Fayoum University's 
Faculty of Engineering in Egypt. The course covers a range of topics, including Simulation Modeling Methodology, 
Queuing Models, Monte-Carlo Simulation, Spreadsheet Simulation, Discrete-Event Simulation, Input Modeling and 
Output Analysis, as well as Verification and Validation of Simulation Models. Additionally, students gain practical 
experience and ability in a specialized discrete-event simulation package as an integral part of the course.  
Given the challenges faced by developing countries in accessing industrial systems that provide real data for 
simulation studies in mini-course projects, it became necessary to explore innovative approaches to implement 
simulation projects, primarily utilizing the available educational resources within the faculty and engaging students 
actively. One such method employed in this project involved students conducting practical simulation experiments on 
virtual manufacturing systems (Physical Simulation), using these experiments to gather the necessary data for 
simulation studies. This approach enables students to identify the stochastic characteristics of real systems and the 
factors influencing their performance. It also allows them to observe existing issues and proposed solutions, which 
can be tested through simulation modeling prior to real-world application. Additionally, this approach facilitates the 
acquisition of fundamental principles and concepts associated with lean manufacturing, as well as the design and 
analysis of industrial systems. 
In the mentioned course, a simplified assembly line, requiring minimal resources, was proposed for implementation, 
and physically simulated by the students in the program's laboratories. The assembly line consisted of four consecutive 
production processes. Four student groups were formed, each assigned specific tasks and deliverables shared among 
the groups. The first group was responsible for conducting physical simulation experiments, recording the experiments 
via video to facilitate data collection and time study analysis. The experiment was designed to yield a sufficient sample 
size for statistical analysis. The primary outcome of this group was the experiment video, which was then handed over 
to the second group. The second group's task involved gathering data on the production time for each process. The 
second group collected and analyzed the data, determining the probability distribution of production time for each 
process on the assembly line, representing the probabilistic inputs to the simulation model. Subsequently, the second 
group prepared a report on the statistical analysis results and passed it on to the third and fourth groups. The third and 
fourth groups utilized a simulation program to develop the simulation model and conducted the necessary simulation 
experiments to ensure the model's validity and accuracy. Furthermore, a series of simulation experiments were 
conducted to test some proposed improvement scenarios for the original assembly line's performance. Each group 
prepared a report summarizing the outcomes of their respective simulation experiments. Finally, an evaluation for the 
outcomes of the different groups was conducted through the course instructor. 
This project provided students with a valuable opportunity to apply the simulation modeling methodology and the 
theoretical concepts covered in the course in a practical context. As a result, students gained the necessary skills to 
apply simulation modeling to the analysis of real-world industrial systems. Throughout the project, students also 
gained proficiency in various computer programs such as Minitab, Stat::Fit, SIMUL8, Anylogic, and Excel. 
Additionally, they developed effective communication skills, learned how to work collaboratively in teams, and 
mastered the skills of coordinating tasks among different teams, replicating real work environments. The students'

Abstract 
Machine learning techniques inspired by the structure and function of the human brain are known as artificial 
neural networks (ANNs). Their popularity has grown in recent years due to their ability to learn and improve via 
training, allowing them to be used in a variety of applications. The ANN approach has the appealing advantage 
of providing an accurate representation of the process input/output data and due to this reason, their application 
in the extraction metallurgy field have increased over the years. This systematic review aims to investigate the 
application and efficacy of ANN for facilitating and upgrading mineralogical data processing in the extraction 
metallurgical field. In this study, 112 research papers, published over years, that discuss ANN application were 
retrieved and 49 research papers were systematically reviewed. Research trends, ANN algorithms models, and 
evaluation methods primarily discussed in the 49 papers were discussed. From the review, it was discovered that 
the main justification to the increase application of ANN in the extraction metallurgy field is due to the ore grade 
decline which makes extraction processes complex demanding a need for a predicting and optimising tool. The 
frequently used ANN algorithm was found to Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm (LMA) which was due to its ability 
to process a lot of data in a short period of time. It was further concluded that the applicability of ANN in 
metallurgical field diverse from processes optimisation using operational to equipment parameters with least error 
and high efficiency. 
Keywords: Artificial neural networks, extraction metallurgy, optimization, ANN algorithms. 
1.Introduction
In recent years, the need for modelling, simulation and optimization of mining and metallurgical processes has 
increased enormously. The growing requirement of these 3 aspects is attributable to the need of saving power, 
energy and costs of the mining and metallurgical processing while achieving a desired grade and recovery of the 
metals processed. Artificial neural network (ANN) or neural network (NN) is a relatively recent branch of artificial 
intelligence that was developed since 1940s (Kasongo and Mwanat, 2021). ANN is known as a complex coded 
computational system developed based on the neurological structure of the human brain with the number of simple 
and highly interconnected processing elements for simulating and processing data. ANN forms a part of machine 
learning that revolves around the interactions between the artificial neural signals from one end to another to 
develop optimization algorithms (Gholami and Khoshdast, 2020; Massinaei and Doostmohammadi, 2010; Olga 
and Shuang, 2021; Tsae et al. 2023). 
 ANN consists of input and output layers with one or multiple hidden layers within. The chief duty of ANN is to 
transform the input data into a significant output. In ANN, all the neurons control each other, and hence, they are 
all connected. The network can concede and detect every aspect of the dataset at hand and how the different parts 
of data may or may not ally to each other (Kang et al., 2020; Kasongo and Mwanat, 2021). These networks are

Abstract 
This article discusses the application of continuous improvement tools in an aeronautical company. The main goals 
are to enhance equipment availability and efficiency, leading to improved Overall Equipment Effectiveness and 
reduced energy costs. The focus is optimizing specific equipment with lower productivity due to limited data and 
documentation. The process at different workstations is analyzed, and data is collected to apply lean tools, aiming to 
increase efficiency by 10% and optimize the equipment's productive capacity by 20%. 
The article explores the fundamentals of lean, originating from the Toyota Production System, which seeks to 
eliminate seven types of waste. Several lean tools such as Single Minute Exchange of Die, 5S, and Standard Work are 
utilized. Additionally, kaizen practices like cross-functional teams, decentralized responsibilities, the pull system, and 
Just-in-Time are employed to complement Lean Manufacturing. The implementation process follows the Plan-Do-
Check-Act methodology, supported by the Hoshin Kanri methodology, allowing for the proper sequencing of actions 
and validation of achievements. Furthermore, the article touches upon the evolution of the aeronautical industry and 
its relationship with lean practices to establish relevant correlations. 
Through the application of these methods, it was considered, based on the data obtained in the initial diagnosis, an 
increase of 17%, 55% and 31% in the efficiency of setups in autoclaves, computerized numerical control machines 
and ultrasound, respectively, which in all exceeded the goal of 10%. As for the increase in equipment availability, 
relevant results were also obtained compared to the 20% target, having reduced about 45h/year in autoclaves in two 
cycles along with a gain of 19% in the occupancy of the surtec.

6. Conclusion 
The work carried out included a study on the theme, which served as a basis for defining the objectives and the 
methodologies to be adopted. Following this, it was decided that the PDCA methodology, aided by Hoshin Kanri, 
would be ideal for a project that aims to improve the productive capacity of industrial equipment. 
Furthermore, it was necessary to know the context in which the project would be developed and, as such, an analysis 
of the aeronautical industry and its evolution at a national and global level was performed. With that in mind, we 
proceeded to research about Lean and, more specifically, Lean Production and its evolution. In this sense, it was also 
essential to evaluate the appropriate continuous improvement tools to be applied in this context to increase the 
efficiency and availability of the machines. In addition, it was also intended to reduce energy costs. 
In this way, a thorough study was done from the methodologies to be adopted, to the Lean philosophy and its tools 
that would then be implemented in the equipment identified as more critical to reduce waste, setup times and thus 
improve productivity. 
Considering the methodologies and tools studied, the workstations were analyzed, and a correlation was established 
between their identified needs and the application method. 
From this, multiple improvement actions were developed in the workstations previously defined. The best results 
came from the autoclaves, both in terms of the efficiency of setups and availability, where a reduction of 364h/year 
was totaled. In the CNC machines it also resulted in a significant improvement in efficiency and, specifically in CMI, 
a 39% increase in availability, which translates to almost a reduction of one shift. In this sense, it is pointed out for 
future work the reduction of another 6% of the machine occupation to grant this objective later outlined. 
Overall, it is possible to conclude that the goals initially set were met, considering the data that resulted from the 
improvement actions implemented at each workstation. Simultaneously, a gradual increase in OEE is already 
perceptible in some posts, however, this indicator is not yet operational in all, since in the initial diagnosis the non-
use of this indicator was identified, which made it impossible to use this indicator in most work posts. 
However, considering the existing data and other indicators used, it is already possible to indicate that the 
improvements had a positive effect.

Abstract 
Digital transformation technologies can enhance work processes and redesign the employees’ tasks but could have a 
huge impact on the employee work deliverables and ultimately the goals and objectives of the organization. The rapid 
growth in cloud-based applications, real-time customer interactions and feedback, and data analytics reports are 
forcing organizations to redefine the business processes, organizational structures, and human resource utilization to 
gain a competitive advantage by incorporating and implementing the new digital technologies (Korn, 2018). Although 
any organization that would like to succeed in implementing a digital transformation strategy needs to focus on 
multiple disciplines and principles within the organization. Equally, an organization could potentially achieve its goals 
by re-engineering business processes and by looking at technologies that underpin and drive organizational 
advancements in their market segment but could be negatively impacted by the lack of skilled employees (Almgren 
and Skobelev, 2020). However, these depend on two elements, namely the choice of digital technology and financial 
capabilities with the ability to use it for value creation. This paper provides some insight into a potential conceptual 
framework to ensure an organization succeeds by focusing on the critical importance of highly skilled and competent 
human resources. The article reviews and defines the potential relationship and influence between the leadership styles 
and the utilization of the human capital within the organization, with the notion that an organization must then 
understand and select the correct digital transformation technology for their industry and ensure alignment with the 
organizational goals and objectives. Additionally, it advocates an approach to defining and measuring the return on 
investment through cost analysis processes and to ensure the implementation of the correct digital strategy roadmap. 
Recent research findings indicate that the estimated failure ratio is between 66% to 84%. (Correani, and De Massis, 
et al, 2020). The inconsistency between the strategy formulation and implementation process is the main issue for 
failure which has a huge financial impact on the organization’s revenue, work deliverables, and products and services. 
As a result, future management processes must ensure that the elements are managed and adjusted to address any 
future economic and market challenges, trends, and new opportunities. Subsequently, such an approach creates the 
foundation and building blocks for success, and future growth for an organization, which could be achieved and 
ensured through a conceptual framework for the successful implementation of an organizational digital transformation 
that ensures all the elements of an organization are redesigned and changed through the digital transformation project.

1. Introduction
The implementation and adaption of digital transformation could provide an organization with a solution to manage 
the future challenges and human resources skills shortages and could provide the organization with new innovative 
product offerings or services. (Brantley and Coleman, 2001). Organizations looking for new and innovative products 
and services are investing in new technologies associated with digital advances and transformation strategies. Before 
digital transformation projects are adopted, the organizations must ensure that they seek guidance from industry 
experts. The biggest risk is in the capitalization of the financial investment and ensuring organizational revenue goals 
are achieved. Organizations fail to capitalize on the transformation projects due to not correctly identifying the indirect 
link between the organization’s digital transformation strategy selected and the actual implementation of the selected

Abstract 
This paper examines Tesla’s unique direct-to-consumer sales strategy in contrast to North America’s more common 
dealership model. Tesla has been a successful company with rising sales and growing more than other automobile 
manufacturers. Furthermore, their system has received positive feedback from customers, who enjoy the ease of 
purchase and online options. Tesla’s sales strategy also reduces the costs to the company in comparison to traditional 
dealership models. However, Tesla has faced challenges in the United States regarding the legality of their sales model 
and is combating this through the courts. Tesla’s model has been a great success for them, which has influenced other 
automobile companies to adopt similar practices to Tesla. In the future, Tesla may advance their direct-to-consumer 
strategy with new ideas to improve their process.

1. Introduction
The use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in transportation and logistical operations is at the forefront of the war against 
climate change caused by carbon emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles (Awwad et al. 2018). As an EV 
manufacturer, Tesla has proven to be innovative in the impenetrable automotive industry. Their ability to create 
success in a previously barren EV market and become the first automotive company to go public in over 50 years 
warrants an investigation into the efficacy of Tesla’s business model. Tesla has changed the way cars are made and 
sold. One of the most obvious ways of investigating Tesla’s success is how many cars they have sold, both 
internationally and domestically in the US that has resulted in a peak market cap of over $1.2 trillion which is larger 
than most legacy auto manufactured combined (Richter 2022). The customer ultimately creates value in the supply 
chain and “in addition to pandemic-related trends, factors related to customer experience are igniting changes in the 
automotive industry” (Ryan 2022). Therefore, through investigation and research into how Tesla gets cars into 
consumers’ driveways, it’s possible to understand how they have achieved their success. 
1.1 Objectives 
This paper aims to investigate Tesla’s Direct-to-consumer (DTC) market systematically. The intention is to understand 
how Tesla has used its sales methodology to grow itself into a major brand with worldwide recognition. In addition, 
this paper will examine various key metrics of Tesla’s market performance through a comprehensive literature review, 
how competitors have reacted and adapted to a changing market, and customer experience and satisfaction with a 
DTC market. This study should also help bring to light some of the key challenges of selling directly to consumers, 
as well as potential benefits related to inventory management and the supply chain. 
2. Literature Review
To evaluate the efficacy of Tesla’s DTC model, academic and news sources were used to track Tesla’s legal, economic, 
and customer approval performance. While Tesla is relatively new in the automotive manufacturing world, there have

selling cars entirely online in 2019.” When they made the decision, many feared “Tesla was making a big mistake” 
(Stenquist 2022). Despite this criticism, Tesla has since gone on to dominate the electric car market with 68% sales 
as of August of this year (Lambert 2022). Tesla puts the purchasing experience directly in the hands of its customers, 
allowing them to customize their vehicles and complete most of the process online, away from the dreaded dealership 
experience. In fact, a Forbes article published last year references a study that found that “75% of customers surveyed 
will spend more to buy from a company that offers a good customer experience.” The Forbes article also describes 
the traditional dealership experience as inefficient. In contrast, online, direct-to-customer models relieve a lot of these 
inefficiencies through “auto-populated contracts and contactless vehicle delivery” (Rains 2021).  
 
To adapt to market changes brought on by various factors including, the pandemic, and the chip shortage, automakers 
have been forced to change with the times. Because of Tesla and others who followed suit, we are now at a point 
where “online car shopping appeals to a large proportion of all car buyers.” Even so, there is data to support the claim 
that people don’t want to eliminate the dealership experience altogether. More mundane tasks like pricing and 
contracts are preferred online, but customers still want a physical place to test drive and experience the car’s features. 
Despite this, “the chief executive of Ford Motors, Jim Farley,” claimed back in June, when the aforementioned New 
York Times article was written, that Ford’s “distribution and advertising costs per car were about $2,000 higher than 
Tesla’s.” To combat this disparity, Farley wanted Ford to “sell cars only online at non-negotiable prices without 
keeping a large inventory of cars at dealerships” (Stenquist 2022). Tesla has been doing this since 2019, and it is now 
clear other automakers are looking at Tesla for inspiration. 
 
Since the New York Times article was written, Ford has gone one step further, implementing certain regulations for 
dealers carrying their vehicles. According to a more recent Wall Street Journal article published in September, “Tesla 
set the bar for selling EVs when early on it decided to forgo a traditional dealership network.” Ford now restricts 
“some dealers from carrying vehicle inventory on the ground and mandates non-negotiable pricing on Ford’s website.” 
To enforce this, Ford is giving nonconforming dealerships until 2024, disallowing any delinquent dealerships from 
selling their vehicles by 2024 (Eckert 2022). 
 
2.7 Advancing Tesla’s DTC Model 
With high prices and a shift in consumer behavior driven by the pandemic, Tesla is “shuttering a number of stores in 
favor of less-expensive locations.” As of mid-2021, when this CNBC article was published, Tesla operated “more 
than 170 galleries and showrooms across the US.” That number has only been decreasing since the onset of the 
pandemic. As time goes on and consumer preferences change, physical stores for all retailers will need to adapt to 
stay competitive. As a Forbes article from mid-2021 puts it, “to help meet the increase in online demand…some 
retailers have introduced ‘dark stores,’ where physical stores are reserved as mini distribution centers solely dedicated 
to supporting home delivery and customer pickup” (Gottlieb 2021). According to a Nasdaq article, Tesla has also been 
trying to keep up with increased demand for online services and have focused on “expanding and enhancing IT 
systems” as well as “reinventing the physical retail experience for customers” (Saraf 2022). 
 
Since the pandemic, auto manufacturers have been rethinking and reimagining the traditional car buying experience. 
Infiniti, for example, which saw a major decrease in sales, “as much as 59% below the level expected,” has introduced 
a new way to test drive and buy its cars. To combat declining sales, Infiniti began to display its vehicles through 
videoconferencing. Furthermore, they began offering test drives to their customers’ homes. This involves “‘bringing 
test-drive cars–fully-sanitized–to the customer’s front door.’” In fact, it was found that “70% of Infiniti customers 
who are aware of the remote offering want it to continue past the pandemic” (Deighton 2020). While Tesla was the 
original innovator for the online buying experience, for its simplicity and timeliness, we see that other automakers are 
being forced to follow suit and, in some cases, are building off Tesla’s original model to further increase the 
convenience factor for its customers. Companies that aren’t willing to change will not have the means to stay 
competitive and relevant in a continuously evolving market. 
 
3. Conclusion 
Tesla’s unique direct-to-consumer model has been a success for the company and has enabled them to influence the 
automotive market in multiple ways. Tesla was one of the first US companies to sell electric vehicles widely and has 
been able to dominate this market in the US, while other major manufacturers are only now starting to catch up on 
designing electric vehicles. Additionally, their direct-to-consumer system has reduced their on-hand inventory while 
still meeting customers’ demand through their use of online selling, where customers get placed on a waiting list. This

enables buyers to customize their orders, giving them a unique and personalized experience while keeping inventory 
levels low. Tesla’s direct-to-customer sales have been received positively by the general public, who enjoyed this 
more than the usual system at a car dealership. However, one disadvantage of this model is the lack of outreach and 
accessibility Tesla has. Customers may not be able to test drive a vehicle before purchasing it and may have difficulty 
servicing their vehicle easily. These disadvantages will need to be addressed by Tesla as they continue to expand. 
Tesla has also experienced legal challenges in opening its stores throughout the United States. However, as time goes 
on, they are making progress with that through the use of lobbying and lawsuits. 
 
Overall, Tesla has experienced success with this new and unique car-selling system. They have reduced their costs 
from traditional automotive selling methods by eliminating the dealership and handling sales themselves. Furthermore, 
some of these practices, such as online sales, have spread to other companies that have begun to adapt their dealerships 
to work in different ways than just selling cars. Tesla’s innovation and unique approach to sales have allowed them to 
experience more growth than they would have otherwise had and influenced the automobile market to adapt to modern 
selling practices.

Abstract 
Accidents or incidents can occur when least expected in the workplace environment. The South African Government 
made provision for safety to be mandatory in terms safety act. The research will follow a mixed-method approach. 
Problem statement: Although safety incidents at work in NGOs are a concern, they are not given high priority as health 
care is. Health care in NGOs seem neglected which reveal gap existing. Findings, an overwhelming non-governmental 
organization complied with the safety regulation. However, NGOs did not comply with the health part. The analysis 
used, SPSS to analyse quantitative data, for, qualitative data (QDA) package Atlas. ti 8th used.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background and introduction
Occupational Health and Safety Act no. 85 of 1993 makes provision for safety at work. Safety, Health and
Environment (SHE) representatives are elected according to 1:50 ratio as prescribed by section 17 of (OHS Act).
Elected members are given training. The study is based on assessment of safety in the South African (NGO’s) Non-
Government Organizations. The case in point happed and was captured by Electronic News Agency (eNCA) News
channel on June 7th, 2016, that fire extensively damaged Durban Christian centre.  (SABC) South African
Broadcasting news also reported on August 16th that Orphanage home was gutted by fire in Durban and eight children
died in the blaze. Esidimeni Life was reported to be had over 100 patients who died due partly to human error. 9th
August 2012, Part of Ikhayalothando orphanage home building caught fire at night. It was not until someone from the
neighboring section saw it and screamed that that the ground man then reacted. The under discussion was extensively
gutted. Morgan (2016), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), defined as ‘self-governing, not-for-profit
organizations that are geared to improving the quality of life of disadvantaged people’. Nanthagopan, Williams, &
Page (2016), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are generally considered to be non-state, non-profit-oriented
groups that function in the public interest.
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of the paper is to measure the rate of compliance with regulations act, Occupational Health and Safety 
Act no. 85 of 1993.  
2. Literature Review
Workforce interventions are premised on regulating the task procedure and physical work environment. Safety 
invariably intends to avert errors, incidental occurrences, and accidents. Latest safety approaches embrace human 
factors and diversity in them. Noting this view, Chen, Leung & Evans (2016), found that other studies focussed, 
examined these incidents and their influence on employee’s welfare. Equally, other studies focused on how employee-
friendly workplaces accommodates innovation.

 In making a final judgment at the inquest, Judge Moseneke ruled that 135 claimants were to be awarded R1 million 
each plus R180 000 for the agony and suffering (Figure 4). Sixty-seven families additional R20 000 for funeral 
expenses. Furthermore, it was found that in 2015, the Department of Health made an undertaking that the conditions 
at Life Esidimeni would be properly assessed after 144 patients died because of negligent caring. The enquiry into 
Life Esidimeni hearing setting is now 110 give evidence. 36 witnesses have been turned up to comply with Section27 
of cross examination the record spanned 50485 pages. Since the inquest began, a high-level official from government 
including HoD Dr Selebano, Dr Manamela and Deputy Director of Health Department Hanna Jacobs have been 
rounded off including the owner of NGO of Precious Angels where about 20 patients died, succumbing to pneumonia. 
In terms of section27, Dr Mvuyisa Talatala who in giving evidence questioned the mental care and the adverse 
outcome including death. Dr Mvuyiso Talataka questioned the dubious decision to cancel to relocate the patients 
without adequate preparations to their ultimate death. As the court came to an end according to section27, its cross-
examination Dr Makgabo Manamela from the Directorate who led it and the key mover of the decision to relocate 
patients from one place to another. The inquest will continue with cross examination around 30 January 2023. The 
ultimate end of the inquest is envisaged to end with former MEC Cedani Mahlangu in April 2023.This was an 
exception of what can go wrong when least expected if guards are dropped. 
 
5.3 Recommendations 
Niosh the framework for core competence for workplace safety and health came in handy. Its theoretical grounding is 
premised primarily on health believe. The framework selects factors that contribute to young workers injuries that 
could be considered: 
• Inexperienced and unfamiliar with variety of work activities to complete a task required.  
• Lack of job-related knowledge, skill and training contribute to increased risk among young part-time employees. 
Often, they are less likely to recognize hazards,  
• Missing life skills and competencies for life such as foundational workplace health and safety knowledge, 
problem solving, critical thinking, managing personal and interpersonal relationship communications and work 
orientation course. Such skills improve work readiness and employability chances.  
 
6. Conclusions 
According to Gallier & Land 1987:900-901, postulate that although the results are deemed logical and academically 
acceptable, conversely, when applying methodological triangulation for mixed method strategy, the results are 
inappropriate. The reason being that the unit analysis was omitted because permission at Life Esidimeni where the 
incident occurred was not granted, as a result it could not be part of the whole analysis: thus, risk in the study and

Abstract 
The masonry brick manufacturing small and medium scale enterprises SMEs contribute significantly towards the socio 
and economic development of the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The masonry brick manufacturing industry assists 
in the development of construction and is a source of income for SMEs, as well as creating employment opportunities 
for the uneducated, unskilled, semi and skilled human capital. However, there are productivity challenges that negate 
growth in productivity. The methodology proposed for the study is based on reviewing literature whereby the main 
question is “How do productivity improvement systems influence productivity growth of the masonry brick 
construction SMEs?” The study explores productivity improvement systems that can be used to improve the 
productivity of masonry brick SMEs. Based on the results of the review, the study recommends that the masonry brick 
SMEs identify latent variables that impede productivity growth within their organisations in order to attain long-term 
term market and financial feasibility.

1. Introduction
According to Mafundu and Mafini (2019) the masonry brick manufacturing small and medium scale enterprises 
(henceforth-abbreviated SMEs) contribute significantly towards the socio and economic development of the Republic 
of South Africa (RSA). This is despite the brick manufacturing industry’s negative contribution towards the 
environment and producing gas emissions in the atmosphere (Nepal et al. 2019). The masonry brick manufacturing 
plays a very important role in that it creates employment opportunities for the unskilled, semi and skilled employees 
(Windapo, Omopariola, Olugboyega and Moghayedi 2021).  
South Africa has one of the strongest economies across the African continent. Real Gross Domestic Product 
(henceforth-abbreviated GDP) was R1 131 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and the economy recorded its fourth

The masonry brick construction SMEs all over world are constantly striving to attain market related excellence that 
gives them a superior edge over their competitors (Singh et al. 2022). A radical redesign of brick production processes 
by SMEs can lead to an achievement in higher levels of productivity (Pakhomova, Dubrakova and Aseev 2021). 
 
3. Research methodology  
The study explored research constructs using a meticulous review of literature. Accredited journals, national and local 
articles, books, government publications that related to the research topic, aligned with the research aim and objective 
of the study, were used. In addition, to answer the research objective, numerous research platforms involving Google 
scholar, Elsevier, MDPI, Emerald publications etc. were also utilized. 
 
4. Discussion and conclusion 
The explored literature demonstrated how instrumental identified productivity improvement systems (ergonomics, 
human resource management and business process re-engineering) are in driving productivity within the masonry 
brick construction SMEs. In accordance to the review of applied literature, productivity improvement systems are lean 
manufacturing mechanisms that coherently contribute significantly towards the productivity growth and efficacy of 
the masonry brick manufacturing SMEs. However, literature read also highlighted key challenges involving a lack of 
concentration, emotional and physical stress, musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), incompetent management, economic 
challenges, technological advancements and competition from rival companies, inadequate training and lack of 
investment from the government and not being able to integrate smart-technology within operational process that 
negate growth in productivity. Thus, undermining the significant impact that these productivity improvement systems 
have on aggregate productivity. It is then pivotal that the masonry brick construction SMEs identify latent variables 
that impede productivity growth within their organisations in order to attain market and financial feasibility. 
 
5. Future Research 
The study explored research constructs using a qualitative methodology through reviewing accredited journals, 
articles, government documents etc. Thus, empirical findings could not be drawn. Furthermore, this research work is 
part of an ongoing study. The research study does not account for all productivity improvement systems that 
undermine the significant impact that productivity systems have on productivity. In addition, the study only employed 
a qualitative review of the literature. This limits the study’s generalisability to other masonry brick construction SMEs 
in South Africa, Africa and globally. Thus, opening up other future research prospects. Research in the future should 
focus on quantitatively assessing the impact of productivity improvement systems on productivity growth of the 
masonry brick construction SMEs.

Abstract 
The South African brick construction small and medium scale enterprise (SMEs) industry operates on the premise of 
optimising profitability and realising market-related competitiveness. However, there are numerous challenges 
affecting the integration of industry 4.0 by the masonry brick construction (SMEs) to improve operational processes 
negating growth in productivity. The study explores the technological concepts that improve operational processes 
and how they stimulate the productivity growth of masonry brick construction SMEs. Using a qualitative 
(inductive/subjective) research approach, this study commenced by listing and identifying relevant research 
publications. This was followed by a comprehensive literature review of the impact of industry 4.0 on productivity 
growth within a domain of the brick construction industry in South Africa. Furthermore, this study provides results, 
conclusions and recommendations emanating from the literature review.

1. Introduction
According to Sacasas (2017), the term “technology” is commonly used loosely in society and in most cases, as a short 
and artless way of defining an instrument such a device/gadget – telephone, laptop, etc. Carroll (2017) explain the 
concept of technology as the science of craftsmanship. Lawaju, Parajuli and Shrestha (2021), the term ""productivity"" 
in construction is often used in conjunction with performance factor, productioFn rate and unit person-hour rate. 
Further literature read report that productivity in SMEs scale brick industries refers to the quantitative relationship 
between bricks generated and resources used that involves coal, clay or sand, water and pipes to utilize water, energy 
(coal, wood and electricity) (Islam et al.   2019) 
The construction small and medium scale SMEs is the most recognised sector in various countries such as Bangladesh, 
Ghana, India and South Africa. Republic (Aniyikaiye et al. 2021). The Construction Industry Development Board 
(CIDB) (2021) stated that the industry plays a significant role in improving the socio-economic development of rural 
and urban communities. The report further mentioned that the construction industry contributes to the creation of jobs 
and measure of the South African Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
According to Mafundu and Mafini (2019) the South African GDP, perceived by many to be the strongest on the 
continent of Africa, the second quarter 2021 revenue was approximately R1.131 billion, increasing by 1.2% in the 
second quarter of 2021 (April–June). Conversely, a 1.5% decrease in South Africa’s GDP was seen in the three months 
to September 2021 compared to the previous quarter. Furthermore, the construction SMEs GDP declined by R110

render old technology obsolete even though this might be disruptive in nature. This requires brick manufacturing 
SMEs to evolve by adjusting to innovative technologies by altering their business models and operational processes. 
Thus, improving service delivery and customer-waiting time. This study recommends that the analysis of the impact 
of industry 4.0 using quantitative research methods be used for future research, considering that this research used a 
qualitative research approach.

Abstract 
The South African mineral exploration industry is capital intensive and the rewards are great for mining companies, 
surrounding mining communities, and the economy of the country. Globally, markets have witnessed an upsurge in 
the value of skill as the nucleus of businesses is on discovering the right individuals and developing their skillsets in 
alignment with technological requirements, objectively to sustain productivity and achieve competitive feasibility. 
However, even though the mining industry is largely concerned with the area of human capital investment and 
employee motivation, there are perennial causes of considerable deviation that seem to undermine the importance of 
productivity systems in enhancing productivity. A qualitative (inductive/ subjective) research approach was followed. 
The research study set out to explore the literature on the following research constructs - human capital investment,

1. Introduction
The mineral exploration industry faces a serious challenge whereby mining houses undermine the significant impact 
that perennial causes of deviation (internal and external factors) from expected productivity have on productivity 
improvement drivers. According to a study conducted by Makhubedu, Anyadiegwu and Mbohwa (2017), International 
and national business markets utilize productivity improvement drivers to enhance productivity. In this regard, the 
success of mining houses depends largely on the quality of their human resources (Sebutsoe and Musingwini 2017; 
Pinigina et al. 2017). 
Statistics SA (2022) report that the real gross domestic productivity (GDP) decreased by 0.7% during the second 
quarter of 2022. The minerals council South Africa (2021) reported that a significant role is played by the mining 
industry in South Africa’s economic development. Even though the mining industry has seen a recovery in the growth 
of production of approximately 11.2% compared to a low base in 2020, the mining production indexed over a 20 year 
period showed that the industry had not improved in comparison to the 2000/ 2006 period and continued to struggle 
to reach the 2015 levels (base year = 100). In the second quarter of 2022, the mining industry in South Africa reported 
a 3.4% decline in production output (Mining Review Africa 2022).  
A report by the daily maverick revealed that mining productivity decreased by 9% in the year to November of 2022 
(Stoddard 2023). This gradual decline can be attributed to prevalent power outages/ load shedding as they continued 
to impact negatively on the productivity output of the mineral exploration industry. Another challenge that faces

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to analyze the causes of potential failure, failure modes and effects models in 
the operational data system. We use failure mode and effect analysis theory based on qualitative data analysis for an 
assessment from in-depth interviews with experts from the healthcare organization utilizing non-probability random 
sampling and purposive sampling 
The data operating system process in healthcare organization, according to the research findings, consists of 
4 factors includes databases, data management, staff, and data utilization. As a result, potential failure, failure modes 
and effects models were 19 variables identified when considering the values S, O, and D, as well as the risk priority 
number. 
Then we analyze the outcomes of the factors obtained by identifying solutions and taking actions to improve 
the data operational system of the healthcare organization by displaying the results: 1) The database by setting up a 
database to manage the data the center collects. A database system exists that enables multiple users to work 
simultaneously. 2) Data management includes managing data structures for input and output data in the input-process-
output pattern, where there is a relationship between the information and a clear connection between various pieces 
of information. 3) Staff should be the framework, scope, and division of the work must all be clearly stated. However, 
the operation needs a mentor to help it work and guide activities on the right path including training employees talents 
and acquiring their experience in the following duties. 4) Data utilization development of people operating systems 
has modernized the use of information. Create a data operating system so that data may be examined, distilled, and 
grouped before use. To suit user needs, provide a system with staff that can input and export data. Along with the use 
of technology to generate data to import and export data consistently, and the systematic of the data by combining the 
necessary data to analyze the data. Furthermore, the study outcomes can be reinforced to assist organizations to see 
the whole link between the data operating system front end and back end processes.

1. Introduction (12 font)
The most valuable economic resource is data, according to Gerd Leonhard (2013). Along with the quick 
transition from the analog to the digital era of technology. The importance of data increases with its impact on 
corporate operations. An idea to build a platform to support the business new business model emerged as it started to 
transform. The business gets more difficult as a result, giving it an advantage. 
Entrepreneurs concentrate on building competitive advantages when faced with company obstacles to 
establish a leading company and develop aggressive prospects for current and future business growth. As an 
alternative, businesses must manage both the front and back ends of operational systems (Nattanaphat Ratchatawiwat, 
2021). It is difficult to manage the enormous volume of data generated every second in the form of documents, text,

Solutions for issues utilizing 
Utilizing data in a modern way 
1. Develop staff operational system 
1.1 Collect the data and keep it in the corporate data center or in the department 
that is in charge of the data as a convenience 
1.2 Create a structure for the operational system of staff in each department that 
is effective and efficient by entering data into the data preparation process and 
exporting data to those who need it promptly, timely and with a greater capacity 
to compete for the organization. 
2. Construct a data operating system 
2.1 Inspect the organization internal working procedures 
2.2 Study and select the most practical and platform technology for the 
organization work system. 
2.3 Define protocols, access techniques and safety measures for user access. 
2.4 Recall users in each department on how the system is actually being used. 
The administrator must assess the degree of complexity of use and evaluate the 
outcomes from actual users because employees understanding of the 
information operating system varies. Additionally, individual employees find it 
difficult to quickly transition from analog to digital work systems. 
Convenient data 
1. Before using the data confirm the raw data and group and distill it. 
2. Develop a system with staff that can import and exports data to satisfy user 
needs. 
Data systematization 
Bring the information you intend to utilize for data analysis and the technology 
together to produce data input and output in a methodical manner. 
 
5.5 Discussion 
 
Findings of the investigation of the failure mode and effect of the healthcare organization data system. In the 
operating system of the healthcare organization, it was discovered that: planning and preparation, structure analysis  
function analysis, failure analysis, FMEA risk analysis and optimization. Since from database, data management, staff, 
and data utilization an analysis of the failure mode and effect. Utilize data users to their fullest potential and maximize 
efficiency, data analysts group of information operating system designers and developers. The outcomes of the 
analysis of the health organization data operating system. It was determined that the analysis of the drawbacks and 
effects of the health organization information system served as the foundation for the investigation to develop remedies 
in advance. To reduce operating system issues or prevent them able to recognize and rank failure mode and effect that 
result from them. The organization also has the ability to exchange resources inside both strategically and tactically 
also executive level. Therefore, the study of healthcare organizations findings suggested that the reason for the failure 
could be determined to encourage process optimization so that the system can better support the operator work across 
the entire data operating system process and assisting in information delivery to junior, middle, and senior executives. 
 
6. Conclusion  
 
Outcome of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) with Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD) by VENSIM 
program and study of the potential failures, failure modes and effects with causal loop diagram data operational system 
in healthcare organization all 4 factors. For help in identifying solutions and failure modes data operational systems 
in the healthcare organization are as follows: 
 
Factors 1 Database: There are approaches to solving the failure modes and effects database are supplying a database 
for the centralized administration of the sources of acquired data and data complexity is reduced. A database system 
develops that enables multiple users to work simultaneously. Mentioning that the amount is insufficient or if the data 
is inaccurate data volume input size should be kept to a minimum. As the recorder is in use, import data and check the 
data. A centralized area can be used to assign rights to manage who can access and view each users data and create 
data editors and user rights. Creating useable manuals, guidelines, strategies, and processes for information security 
give people the ability to modify, update, confirm, and verify access to user accounts and system access rights.

Factor 2 Data Management: There are approaches to solving the failure modes and effects of data management are 
format import data gathering process and ensuring data independence The data is taken out of the data structure update. 
Specifying and formatting data recording to maintain data integrity. The data input is verified as part of the data 
analytics process using the data source that was collected and screening the facts that will be analyzed. Development 
groups data for processing, sorting, calculating, analyzing, and creating data the process of preparing data by creating 
a common data format that must be utilized consistently and proportionally store the data format. 
 
Factor 3 Staff: There are approaches to solving the failure modes and effects of staff are which is professional 
experience, which before beginning work, a mentor is required to oversee the practice, work, work plan, and work 
steps and work procedures for operators to use. The operators job description, work schedule, and task prioritization 
all affect how quickly work is completed. A mentorship system that has a framework is in place to train the operation 
and evaluate the teams skills and body of knowledge prior to working, and instruct operators. There is always a mentor 
present to monitor the work as it is being done. Additionally, training has been devised to become proficient in 
operations and make poor selections after work should have a system work on creating a functional handbook with an 
inhole system, types of descriptions, diagrams, methods, tables, and procedures. Important details that explain what 
the user must pay attention to or oversee while working must be put out thoroughly and clearly in order. Use clear 
terminology when communicating. The operators performance standards are determined by the director. To assist in 
monitoring, assessing, and performing of the practitioners worker, regularly administer and manage the division of 
job duties and evaluate the follow up. Occasionally, ways are sought to enhance and resolve operational errors, as well 
as knowledge creation, training, and practice for both soft and hard skills, as well as the ability of workers to inspire 
work motivation, the knowledge and aptitude of personnel about Work procedures, and the expertise and aptitude of 
personnel by defining the scope of work of each personnel. and clarity of the performance of duties has an outline, the 
extent of the action plan to the operators, and assigned work. 
 
Factor 4 Data Utilization: There are approaches to solving the failure modes and effects of data utilization depending 
on how information is used modernizing staff operational systems and data usage, creating a data operating system, 
ready-to-use data by evaluating raw data and categorizing data before using it. Create a system with staff for products 
imports and exports data that brings the desired information to fulfill the users and the information system goals. It 
was used to develop input and output data in an organized manner using technology and data analysis. 
 
7. Development and Implementation  
 
Database policy (Digital Government Development Agency, 2019) establishes an exchange central data link 
and develops an infrastructure and centralized platform that can be used continuously. Data management policy 
(Digital Government Development Agency, 2019) data management improvements in a central location and 
development data management platform with links for automatic data exchange that go through a single data exchange 
hub. Staff (Government Institute for the Promotion of Big Data Analysis and Management: GBDi Digital Economy 
Promotion Agency, 2019) develop a framework for the analysis and use of data in personnel operations. The three 
phases of the operational framework are short-term to the improvement of staff skills, medium-term implement a 
mechanism for managing the workforce, and long-term expansion of the duration of consultancy lead results 
encourage outside workers or the private sector to contribute to bettering the organization's operations. Data Utilization 
(Digital Government Development Agency, 2019) develop platform-based technology that can connect applications 
and promote business innovation growth through public-private partnerships.

Abstract 
The services employment figures in the world’s biggest economies demonstrate that the service sector has become the 
largest sector of the economy in most developed countries. As studies demonstrated that Lean has a positive effect on 
operational performance, service providers are adopting Lean, where Lean Service is the application of Lean to 
services. This research presents a case study with qualitative and quantitative methods approach, where a new online 
free service of knowledge transfer was created in co-creation with a customer focus-group. Two years of investigation 
were carried out, from April 2021 to April 2023, with a total of twenty-four online sessions, meaning fifty-one hours 
of knowledge transfer to a universe of 1118 customers. It became evident an empowerment in customer engagement, 
through co-creation and customer experience, where 89% of the customers attend more than one online session, and 
31% more than five. The implementation process was surveyed through a series of interviews to obtain the voice of 
the customer and customer experience, and based on quantitative data, it became clear that the Lean Service helped to 
empower customer engagement.

1. Introduction
As service industries represent the tertiary sector, which encompasses all economic activities besides agriculture, 
industry and construction (INE 2018). Based on the services employment figures in the world’s biggest economies, 
the service sector has become the largest sector of the economy in most developed countries (Almeida-Sousa, 2021), 
meaning this sector contributed the most to the Gross Domestic Product in the most productive economies (Statistica, 
2023). 
Organisations and individuals operating in the service sector focus on using knowledge, information, and expertise to 
provide services, where the expansion of the service industry is a result of the increase in knowledge, the rapid 
technological growth, and the development of fast communication tools and infrastructures that have occurred in the 
last decades (Statistica, 2023).

Despite the contribution of this paper to Lean Services, being a single case study, has its inherent limitations. 
Nevertheless, and based on the results obtained, to proceed this investigation and help organisation to continue to 
empower customer engagement, a third phase is now being prepared, supported by Lean Service, where customer co-
creation and customer experience will continue to be the pillars of future research towards a long-term customer 
strategy.

results, LLMs require careful fine-tuning. Using techniques such as prompt engineering and In Context Language 
(ICL), it is possible to provide LLMs with the necessary guidance to perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy 
and relevance. Deep Neural Networks have limited capabilities in intelligent behavior (i.e., in understanding the 
meaning of its input). Hence, the scientific community started to question more heavily in recent years whether Deep 
Learning alone could get us closer to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The authors of this paper believe that the 
training and adaptive behavior challenges were a big part of the problem and that symbolic techniques did not 
advance simultaneously as Deep Neural Networks. Hence, revisiting and renewing the symbolic techniques and 
combining them with Deep Learning models like the LLMs can bridge the gap between neural techniques and 
symbolic knowledge representation. Our proposed system has been shown to significantly improve the performance 
of LLMs in terms of hallucination rate while providing flexibility of semantic input processing to symbolic systems.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we will describe our challenges and developments when navigating a new wave of AI research where 
new, state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) models are opening a multitude of paths for exploration and 
demonstrate with a practical application how to apply prompt engineering as a way to make connectionist models 
perform symbolic reasoning. Before going deeper into this study, it is important to note what many authors describe 
as the main paradigms of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Symbolism and Connectionism. In the article (Zhang et al. 
2022), it is explained how since the birth of AI in 1956 there were times when symbolic models were dominant, 
followed by impressive connectionist advancements, while also noting none are, by themselves, complete to get 
closer to the so-called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Many authors can find deep studies on the competing 
paradigms, and AI professionals have explored their limitations since the beginning. In his book, (Dyer et al. 1991) 
describes his journey exploring both, explaining his challenges with the lack of dynamic memory management or 
virtual pointers in connectionist models, and his discontent with how knowledge engineering heavy the symbolic 
systems might become, for example. From another perspective, for the past decades, cognitive science has been 
exploring the relations between brain and mind, where you can relate the human brain to Connectionism, to Neural

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented a model combining connectionist and symbolic techniques, leveraging in particular the 
latest advances in the neural computing field, the LLMs. Although the SAuroN model proposed here is a simple 
example of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs to perform symbolic processing, this can potentially be applied to create 
other forms of knowledge representation, such as knowledge graphs, propositional logic, and semantic networks, 
among others. We believe that with this approach, the best of both worlds can be achieved: the plasticity of neural 
networks, the language understanding capabilities of the latest LLM models, and the knowledge representation and 
manipulation of the symbolic models. 
Naturally, this is a simple first step in that direction, and there is much room to explore and improve. SAuroN 
introduces the possibility of transitions between states to be semantically triggered, and the symbolic modeling avoids 
hallucination and injection attacks, current challenges for LLM models. It could potentially help the limitations 
described in (Bubeck et al. 2023) around weak symbolic manipulation and basic mathematical mistakes. 
In terms of size limitations, LLMs have a limited context, and as a system becomes more and more complex, the size 
of the prompts used for few shot learning might become a limitation. As we use SAuroN or models derived from its 
idea, the symbolic layer might be used to select the proper prompt, narrowing the context for that particular moment 
of the operation and removing that limitation. A few ideas for further exploration and development are: 
 
• How to transfer the knowledge acquired from the operation of the symbolic layer to the neural layer 
• The model can handle inputs with great flexibility and plasticity, but the outputs would still follow traditional 
logic rules. To make outputs flexible, we need to give more room to the generative AI, and the problems of 
hallucination and injection would be back. 
• As we create more sophisticated symbolic models like knowledge graphs, new ideas will be necessary to search, 
extract, and present knowledge 
 
As discussed in this paper, the latest advances in the neural computing field, the LLMs, are sparking the debate about 
hybrid techniques and different approaches to reach a superior quality AI system. At the same time, these new models 
are being used to create exciting novel applications in different areas and industries. The idea of combining neural 
and symbolic techniques is not new, and we believe as one field advances, the other should be revisited to evaluate 
the potential of the combination of both. 
We hope this contribution helps in the pursuit of pieces of the ancient puzzle, that is, to understand the relations 
between the brain and the mind, and take us one step closer to recreating those impressive structures on artificial 
systems.
