1. Introduction
Internet of things (IoT) is the rapid evolution of infrastructure that allows interconnecting systems (Ali et al. 2022). In 
the IoT-based system, devices and machines have the networking capability to collect various data from the 
environment by using sensors, sharing the data by using the internet, and acting on those data automatically without 
human intervention (Dwivedi et al. 2021). Industrial IoT (IIoT) is the concept of interconnected, intelligent, and 
automated factory setups to improve efficiency and manufacturing processes (Dhirani et al. 2021). IIoT ensures high 
reliability, and low latency and deals with a large amount of data. This system has the capability of intelligent 
operation, asset optimization, intelligent maintenance, remote monitoring etc (Anon 2021). IIoT system provides the 
real-time exchange of information, improves the control on the manufacturing processes, enables improved situational 
awareness, and increases productivity (Xenofontos et al. 2021) It creates complex network services that enable a high 
level of automation (Tsiknas et al. 2021). Moreover, it is considered as the key technology for industry 4.0 (Pop et al. 
2021). During the pandemic (covid 19) situation, most companies were interested in transferring them to IIoT 
(Wójcicki et al. 2022) IIoT integrates AI, mobile communication, big data analysis, IoT, and cloud computing into 
the industrial production system (Wang et al. 2021). Figure 1 shows the IIoT architecture/high-level IoT, which 
consists of four components: equipment and devices, applications, cloud, networks. In the figure, there has four layers: 
application layer, processing layer, network layer, and perception layer. The application layer is responsible for 
managing of managing and ensuring that the end user's application-specific requirements are met. The processing 
layer is a decision-making phase as well as a large volume of data is stored. Network layer consists of different 
connectivity network, including WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, Narrow Band-IoT, etc which are responsible for relaying the 
information. Perception layer consists of various kinds of security cameras, sensors etc. These devices track factors 
of environment, gather data etc (Abosata et al. 2021).

of the company is required to eliminate this challenge. The average value of ξL is 0.128223198, which is closer to 
zero. So, the output result is reliable and the standard deviation is also lower which indicates that there has the 
homogeneity of the expert’s opinions. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The IIoT system is beneficial for providing the real time data, cost effectiveness, increment of productivity, etc. The 
system can be used in many sectors like production, healthcare, supply chain, retailer, etc. But for the implementation 
of IIoT, there are some challenges faced by the industry. In this study, the implementation challenges of the IIoT 
system were found. The study was conducted on the Bangladeshi electronics manufacturing industry. The challenges 
were found out from the literature review and industrial experts' help. The challenges were ranked by using the BWM. 
""Estimating ROI"" was determined as the most important challenge with the highest optimal weight value among the 
other defined challenges while implementing the IIoT for the Bangladeshi electronics manufacturing industry. This 
study's outcome result indicates the importance of clarifying the investment cost and the return of the cost. The output 
result of this study will help the industrial manager to observe the importance of the challenges. The least optimal 
average weight value was for the challenge of cultural resistance. The theoretical benefit of this research is that the 
literature on the industrial automation sector is increased. The practical benefit is that this study may help the 
companies to provide the important guidelines when the company wants to implement IIoT. During the 
implementation of the IIoT, the industrial manager can get a list of challenges ranked by importance. This research 
will enable industrial managers and practitioners to assess and investigate the impact of the challenges defined for 
implementing the IIoT system. 
 
This research is not free from limitations. This research is performed in the Bangladeshi electronics manufacturing 
industry. Eight most important challenges were considered for this research. The output result may vary when the 
research is performed in another industry or in another country. This limitation can be solved by performing this 
research in another industry.

Abstract 
Automobile steering system is used to steer a car to the desired path. Electro-Hydraulic Power Steering System can 
be found in Ford, Volkswagen, Audi, and Nissan cars. In this paper, an energy-saving electro-hydraulic power steering 
system for an automobile is presented. The proposed technique has reduced energy consumption and improved the 
steering feel as compared to the conventional. In the proposed technique, the use of a DC motor gear pump instead of 
engine engine-driven pump ensures a good steering feel at high speed and good steering portability at low speed. The 
adaptive Fuzzy-PID controller reaches the motor speed set point faster than PID hence improving the steering feel 
compared to the PID controller. The electric and hydraulic power consumption data are collected at 5.23 Nm steering 
torque. The experimental results show that the hydraulic pressure developed in the hydraulic chamber is proportional 
to motor speed. In conventional controllers, the power consumption increases with car speed but in manual, PID, and 
Fuzzy-PID controller, the power consumption decreases with car speed compared to conventional. The electric power 
consumption of conventional, manual, PID, and Fuzzy-PID controllers at 0-120 km/h vehicle speeds are 5544 W, 
1979.8 W, 1915.2 W, and 2017.9 W, respectively. The hydraulic power consumption of conventional, manual, PID, 
and Fuzzy-PID controllers at 0-120 km/h vehicle speeds are 1192.8 W, 349.85 W, 335.72 W, and 361.19 W, 
respectively.

1. Introduction
The automobile steering system is most important as it controls the vehicle’s direction according to the driver’s 
steering wheel direction. It ensures the vehicle’s safety and controllability. If the steering system is not properly 
designed, the steering may be pulled to one side. The known problems of the steering system are excessive steering 
effort or excessive steering wheel free-play (Diagnosis). The two basic types of steering systems are manual or 
mechanical steering systems and power steering systems.  In a conventional power steering system, as shown in Figure 
1(a), a vane pump directly driven from the vehicle engine delivers hydraulic power to steer the front wheels of the 
automobile easily (Heinz 2002). Plenty of automobiles with conventional power steering systems are still on the road. 
However in a conventional power steering system, the amount of hydraulic power generated is proportional to engine 
speed. There are two problems in conventional power steering systems. 1) At low speed, the vane pump’s discharge 
rate is minimal. Therefore, the developed hydraulic pressure is minimal which is not sufficient to move the front 
wheels comfortably. 2) At high speed, the pump discharge rate increases, and the hydraulic power as well as power 
consumption increases. In conventional power steering system, driver feels very light steering at high speed, and 
difficult steering at low speed. The assist effort is not suitable as preferred (Tang et al. 2002).  
But driving comfort means high-speed steering feel and low-speed steering portability, which plays an important role 
on driver’s behavior (Mammar and Koenig 2002). By replacing the engine driven pump with a controllable motor 
pump, the steering effort can be changed according to vehicle speed. Figure 1 (b), shows the structure of the proposed

6. Conclusion 
Energy-saving by electrification of the power steering system has been presented in this paper. It has been found that 
the conventional controller motor speed response is faster than other controllers but the power consumption is the 
highest. The power consumption of the PID controller is the lowest but the motor speed response is the slowest. The 
manual controller has better speed response than PID and fuzzy-PID but it can’t reach the motor speed automatically. 
The fuzzy-PID is faster than PID and consumes less power than conventional and manual and it can reach the set point 
automatically at different vehicle speeds. Though it consumes more power than PID it ensures a good steering feel. 
The steering feel of conventional is not suitable at different vehicle speeds.

Abstract 
The Ready-Made Garments sector has been the major export sector in Bangladesh over the years. The aim of this 
paper is to identify the influence of supply chain management for better advancement in this sector. Unique 
features like business, wage, time frame, supply chain, and compliances are included in the export-oriented RMG 
sector which makes it distinct from other businesses. Without appropriate supply chain management, the prospect 
of growth for any business is extremely low. Data for this study is collected from secondary sources. In our study, 
we try to emphasize how RMG aligns with supply chain strategies and collaborates along with the supply chain 
partners and logistics. According to proper SCM procedure, our study tries to conduct the problems, analyze, 
eradicate, and modify the technologies. The outcome of the study may not be generalized as the data we are going 
to use from secondary sources.

Introduction 
In terms of foreign c:urrency earning RMG sector is the leading one in our country alongside employing a large 
number of people. Though the COVID epidemic caused a huge fall in other business sectors, RMG stands tall and 
contributes 84% of the overall country's exports. In the immediate past 2020-21 fiscal years, the exports grew by 
10% to $30.86 billion. With apparel export earnings of $15.91 billion, Bangladesh reclaimed its second position 
as an RMG products exporter from Vietnam during the January-June period of 2020-21. The Five basic items are 
shirts, trousers, jackets, T-shirts, and sweaters. Together they make up more than 70% of total readymade garment 
exports. Germany, US, UK, France, and Spain all these countries buy these RMG products. 
Conversely, supply chain management deals with customer satisfaction regarding manufacturing and services. It 
is the management of an interconnected business network to provide service to the customer who lies at the bottom 
end of a supply chain. All these key points are most valuable for the RMG sector. Supply chain management is 
the centralized administration of the flow of goods and services and it encompasses all processes that transform 
raw materials into finished items. So RMG industries can emphasize decreasing costs and delivering items to 
customers by optimizing the supply chain. Consequently, supply chain management can be an enormous factor in 
the RMG sector of Bangladesh. A structured supply chain management system can enhance the sensibility as well 
as the serviceability. Several benefits including compressing the lead time and elevating the productivity will be 
accomplished by implying supply chain management. 
From the origin of supply to the source of demand, supply chain management extends all the efforts and 
acquirement of raw materials. According to this scenario, no doubt supply chain management is presenting a new 
standard in this sector. Supply chain management optimizes the efficiency of the industry by increasing the 
response capability to customers. In the meantime, productivity and profitability rates is also grown by reducing 
operational cost, cycle time, and inventory costs. The structured practice of SCM in the garment sector can lead 
to a quality alliance of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors. To meet health, social, and environmental 
acquiescence and to maintain low cost as well as high quality within a minimal time, simple management activities 
cannot go hand to hand.  This will lead to inactive, insufficient, and incompetence in the international market. 
Hence such an important sector needs to be sustained by proper supply chain management.

Conclusion  
Our study tries to implement the importance and advantages of structural supply chain management in the RMG 
sector of Bangladesh. From the correlation part, it can be concluded that there lies a strong interconnection 
between supply chain management with the advancement of RMG industries. The study shows the significance 
of RMG industries by its export and employing female workers. While analyzing the data from the source 
BGMEA, we intended to manifest how the supply chain can influence the development of RMG industries.  
The previous studies that have been done on this subject discussed the dependence on raw materials, 
responsiveness, lead time, and also the approach to supply chain management. Whereas, our study emphasizes 
finding the correlation between top supply chain management and the advancement of RMG industries and 
establish some hypotheses for further studies. We also try to compare the approach of average and top SCMs in 
the RMG sector. We come to have top SCM is very influential rather than the average SCM in this sector. We 
gathered our data from secondary sources which can be considered a limitation of our study and analysis. 
The purpose of our study is to show the significance of supply chain management in the advancement of the RMG 
sector of Bangladesh. We analyzed, summarized, and correlated these two parameters. We also state some 
hypotheses regarding the issue that carries the positivity of this sector. 
 As this is an enormous sector to develop, there are always some potential topics to research in the future like 
implementing automation on SCM, Supply chain sourcing and logistics on RMG, Integrated Supply Chain on 
RMG, etc.

Abstract 
When analyzing real systems, collecting field data can be difficult. Therefore, many methods have been developed 
to generate artificial random numbers. One of the fundamental methods is the Linear Congruential Generation 
(LCG) method. It can generate random numbers based on the values of its parameters. This paper aims to identify 
the key parameter that has the highest impact on the performance of the LCG method, particularly in terms of the 
random number repetition period. To do this, the Design of Experiment (DOE) technique was used, and a model 
was developed using Minitab software. The experiment was conducted five times, and the average was taken for 
better results. The Python code of the LCG method was used to determine the random number repetition period. 
According to the results of the study, it was found that the parameter ""m"" had the highest impact on the performance 
of the LCG method, followed by ""a"", ""c"", and ""Seed"" respectively.

1. Introduction
Numerous external factors affect the systems under study and internal system component behaviors exhibit 
nondeterministic, or random, patterns. Therefore, it is required to reproduce the random effects that are present in 
the system to generate a simulation model that is reflective of the system under investigation. To incorporate 
random effects into consideration, random numbers are helpful. Using the stream of data gathered from the 
observation is one potential way to create the random effects that are present in the system. However, using field 
data has several drawbacks such as- limited in number, time-consuming, not applicable for non-existent systems, 
etc. Therefore, a method to artificially generate random data that satisfies the analyst's required criteria must be 
developed (Khoshnevis 1994). This algorithm or approach is known as a pseudo-random number generator. The 
most well-known pseudorandom number generator is the linear congruential method.  Even though there are 
other alternatives, many users still prefer to use LCGs in their research works (Hermawan  2023). The quality of 
the random numbers produced by the LCG method is substantially impacted by the parameter values chosen 
(Averill and Dabid, 2003). However, no article explicitly demonstrates the size of the impact of each parameter on 
the effectiveness of the LCG method. 
1.1 Linear Congruential Method (LCG) 
The Linear Congruential method uses the following recursively evaluated equation with a random number 
generated at each iteration: 
Zi = (a*Zi-1+c) mod m;    ri = Zi / m 
where Z0 is the seed. Parameters a, c, and m, as well as the seed, are nonnegative integers and must satisfy 0 < m, 
a < m, c < m, and Z0 < m (Khoshnevis, 1994). 
1.2 Objectives 
This study aims to identify the key parameter of the LCG method that has the most impact on its performance so 
that users can carefully choose the value of the key parameter to get a satisfactory performance of the method on 
their specific task. The result should indicate the percentage of effects of each parameter on its performance,

Figure 3. Effect of parameters of the LCG method in the five DOE 
After analyzing and collecting the result of each experiment, the average contribution was calculated to find the 
key parameter of the LCG method as shown in Table 1. The cumulative result indicated that the parameter “m” 
has the largest impact on the random number repetition period (47.426%) than the parameters “a”, “c” and “Seed” 
(11.304%, 0.814%, and 0.006%). From the experiment, it was found that “Seed” has the least impact on the random 
number repetition period in the LCG method.

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
In this study, we have identified the key parameter of the Linear Congruential method in random number 
generation. The Design of the Experiment technique helps us to perform this analysis and get the results. Python 
code helps us to determine the repetition period of random numbers. The Excel model helps us to verify whether 
the repetition period is correct or not. The novelty of this study is finding the degree of effects of each parameter 
on the random number repetition period of the LCG method. The value of parameter ‘m’ should be chosen carefully 
as it has the largest impact on the method’s performance. For further study, the number of design of experiment 
and level of factors may be enhanced to get more accurate results. The interaction between the factors could be 
analyzed to determine whether a certain pair of factors has a significant impact on its performance.

Abstract 
There are ups and downs observed in shipbuilding growth. United Kingdom (UK) was the market leader 
in global shipbuilding before WWII. After that, Japan became the dominant shipbuilding nation in the 
1960s and slowly lost its competitive advantage to the promising industrial nation South Korea, as they 
had the advantages of much cheaper wages, a suitable shipbuilding strategy, strong government support, 
and cheaper currency. South Korean shipbuilding overtook Japan's in 2003. In 2009, during and after the 
global financial crisis China became a global shipbuilding leader leaving behind South Korea and Japan 
by using the same strategy and technique of the two shipbuilding giants. China utilized the global 
financial crisis to develop its shipbuilding and they initially targeted the medium and small global market 
of containers, tankers, and cargo ships. Bangladesh is a maritime nation with a glorious shipping and 
shipbuilding history. However, the country has failed to keep pace with the global shipbuilding race due 
to a few reasons. We must utilize our potential and opportunities to meet the challenges for sustainable 
development of the shipbuilding industry. This analytical paper will describe the potentials and 
challenges of local shipbuilding in a contest of global and will suggest a suitable shipbuilding market for 
Bangladesh.

Introduction 
Shipbuilding is a primitive and labor-intensive industry. Conventional shipbuilding was a low-tech 
industry (Hossain et al. 2017). After the invention of arc welding technology, normal steel with 
insufficient fracture toughness was used in shipbuilding, and that resulted in some ships suffering 
catastrophic brittle fracture and structural failure. Since the 1950s, specialized high tensile strength and 
tough steel with good physical and chemical properties have been used in the shipbuilding industry 
(Hossain 2023g). Modern steel has eliminated brittle fractures in ships (Stopford M 2009). Distinct 
beautification and work excellence are found in modern shipbuilding. Today’s shipbuilding needs a lot 
of automation and uses a line production manufacturing process, where a skilled workforce is essential. 
Ship design work, usually known as naval architecture, is finalized ship drawing after ship model testing 
either in towing tank/basin or CFD analysis. Modern shipbuilding makes considerable use of 
prefabricated blocks or modules, where entire multi-deck segments of the hull are built elsewhere in the 
yard, transported to the building dock/slipway, and then lifted into place and the fabrication process is 
done as per the guideline of naval architects. This is known as block or module construction.  
So, modern shipyards pre-install machinery, equipment, pipes, electrical cables, and all other 
components within the blocks, to minimize the effort needed to assemble components within the hull, 
once it is welded together (Hossain 2018a). Again, incoming 4IR or Industry 4.0 will influence the whole 
maritime sector and new transformations will be taking place in the shipbuilding industry and that will 
be very decisive in nature (Noordstrand 2018). The main goal of shipbuilding 4.0 is an intelligent 
shipyard that is characterized not only by adaptability, resource efficiency, and ergonomics but also by 
close integration among ship owners, shipbuilders, suppliers, and other stakeholders both in industry and 
in value processes (Hossain 2023f).  
Bangladesh with its vast and young population has immense opportunity to develop any labor-intensive 
heavy industry like shipbuilding. Local shipbuilding has adequate potential and prospects. However, 
Bangladesh has failed to keep pace with the continuous technological advancement in global 
shipbuilding. Moreover, a few typical problems and challenges have created obstacles to development

Abstract 
The ship recycling industry refers to the process of dismantling and recycling End of Life (EOL) ships and it’s globally 
accepted. Basically, ship recycling is a significant and green industry, with an average of 1000 obsolete ships being 
recycled annually. At present global ship recycling industry is dominated by three South Asian countries, including 
India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. In Bangladesh, the industry started with the dismantling of stranded ships and has 
since become a large and profitable industry. The industry creates huge employment opportunities for thousands of 
semi-skilled workers in poverty-prone areas of the country. Such an industry has both opportunities and challenges 
for coastal zone management, as there are environmental, law enforcement, and worker safety issues. Perfect green 
ship recycling as per European standards is always a costly affair.  But, viable and almost green ship recycling with 
the integration of the present usual practice (beaching method) in Asian countries is very much possible. Despite the 
limitations and challenges the industry has considerable contribution to the GDP and the overall socio-economic 
sphere of Bangladesh. Presently, there have been visible reductions in Bangladesh's market share due to strict 
environmental regulations, while the competitors have experienced increases. It is an analytical study with 
considerable effort of research work to evaluate the present global ship recycling situation along with the potential 
and challenges of the local ship recycling industry.

1. Introduction
Ship dismantling, commonly known as ship recycling, is a naturally sustainable activity, the repayment of which is 
felt at the global level. Ship recycling is a reverse engineering process (Hossain  2015) of dismantling obsolete ships 
to recover reusable materials in a safe and environmentally friendly way (Hossain 2017a&b). If we look last twenty 
years, ships are beaches mainly in a few South Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, China, and Pakistan allowing 
local yards to dismantle the vessels with moderate prevention measures with more manpower involvement (Nikos 
2017). Those South Asian Countries are doing a great job as they are recycling obsolete old and EOL ships with good 
efficiency, but in a less professional manner (Hossain 2023a&c). For the last two decades, ship recycling yards in 
Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, China, and Turkey have recycled globally 95% of EOL ships in tonnage. The increase in 
demand for ship recycling has rightly led to an increase in regulatory pressure at both national and international levels. 
However, beaching as a ship recycling method is mainly used in Southeast Asia due to geographical advantage and 
tidal conditions. Whereas, constructing and running dry docks is quite expensive, though dry-docking is the safest 
method. More environmentally concerned countries like the USA and EU usually adopt the dry-dock technique 
(Hossain 2023n&o). However, a few countries in Asia and Europe have adopted the alongside or pier-breaking 
approach instead of beaching like Turkey or China. Right now, Aliaga in Turkey and a few other places in the EU are 
the most vocal against the slipway or landing recycling technique with the highest environment-friendly technique 
(Hossain and Mohiuddin 2023b). 
In South Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, China, and Pakistan, EOL ships are beaches for dismantling and 
recycling the vessel while taking advantage of the high tidal surge. However, those countries are doing a great job of 
saving the environment by recycling obsolete and unused ships with good efficiency, which were earlier buried at the 
deep sea as we have learned from history (Banglapedia 2011). Currently, 35% of the shipping tonnage recycled 
annually occurs on the beaches of Bangladesh, employing around 200 thousand workers in the recycling process. 
Moreover, it is estimated that the ship recycling industry generates around US$ 1 billion for the national economy.

Abstract 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows computer programs to learn from experience through iterative processing and 
algorithmic training and represents human intelligence. Now, AI has become a hot topic and important debates have 
risen like, how it might affect the job market and what is the end of global civilization. Many people will lose their 
jobs due AI. On the other hand, few technology lovers think that it will lead to the creation of lots of diversified and 
interesting jobs. Many experts think that it will have a big impact on the workplace and all aspects of human life in 
the near future. In reality, AI can make jobs more creative, lucrative, and flexible, and will lead definitely to a more 
creative and skilled economy. However, history says, that advanced technologies are usually starting to take away 
more jobs than they create, and unfortunately, this trend will continue. Nowadays, there have been many ideas for 
how to solve this problem, and there should be updated education and skill develop program with new schooling 
system and that need to be introduced very soon. As there isn't enough work for everyone in the world, so the whole 
lifestyle and education system needs to be changed and to reorganize every aspect to make total human resource 
development system more purposeful. It is an analytical paper to analyze the potentials and challenges of AI along 
with the consequences of global future and way forward.

1. Introduction
AI is basically a simulation of human intelligence by machines, especially by computers, to do tasks that usually 
require human intelligence, like seeing, hearing, making decisions, and translating between languages. Sire by Apple, 
Alexa by Amazon, Google Maps, and ChatGPT by OpenAI are all examples of AI that people use every day 
(CSU2021). Since this can be done quickly; far quicker than a human could. Today, people realize, AI-controlled self-
driving cars (KeremGulen2022), are a sign of fact, the future of AI is getting closer, and the concept of a driverless 
car is no longer the stuff of science fiction. Recent studies say that by 2040, there will be about 33 million cars that 
can drive themselves by using AI. On the other hand, AI in healthcare is become a popular term for the use of ML 
algorithms and software. Again, AI is going to imitate perfectly human cognition in the analysis, evaluation, 
calculation, presentation, and understanding of complex physical, medical, mental, and healthcare data, or to go 
beyond human capabilities by giving new ways to diagnose, choose drugs, treat, or prevent disease 
(Mullainathan2022).  AI has the ability of computer programs to draw close conclusions based only on the data they 
are given. AI can examine connections between various types of clinical data and final patient outcomes (Coiera1997). 
AI now affects almost every part of our lives, from choosing what books, goods, electronic household items, or flights 
to buy online to deciding if our job applications are accepted, if we get a bank loan, and even what care we get for 
cancer or other diseases (Hossain 2023a&f). A lot of big tech companies, like Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, 
have opened new study labs for AI. It's not much of a stretch to say that software now means AI (BBCFuture 2017). 
Peter Norvig, Google's director of research and a pioneer of ML said, ‘AI has shown that it can do a lot of useful 
things, like label photos, understand spoken and written natural language, and help find diseases. For example, today, 
Google Maps' usefulness to travelers is mostly due to AI. It has allowed us to create detailed road maps in a fraction 
of the time of any part of the globe. Many in the financial sector see a bright future for AI, particularly in the banking 
sector (Brynjolfsson 2017). We may also rely on AI-powered apps to keep us safe and comfortable while we ride 
bikes, stroll, or take public transportation.

Abstract 
The Internet of Things (IoT) often refers to the addition of network connectivity to ordinary objects or equipment that 
was previously not internet enabled. It is about connecting everyday objects to the internet and letting them 
communicate with each other, including humans. The IoT makes technologies smarter by enabling automation, 
personalization, and remote control via networks of Internet-connected sensors. At the same time, IoT technologies 
raise significant privacy concerns, which may hinder their wider adoption. IoT applications range from smart homes 
and wearable gadgets to industrial automation, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, ecosystem, warfare, business, 
education, etc. The IoT has the potential and prospects to completely transform our lives by enabling smarter, more 
connected, flexible, more relaxed, and more efficient systems. IoT has the potential to develop industries' efficiency, 
increase productivity, and improve our daily lives. IoT will be more global technology, and more things will become 
internet-connected in the future. It is an analytical paper to evaluate the IoT as a global technology, as well as depict 
its domains, challenges, and future consequences.

Introduction 
The internet of things (IoT) is a catch-all term for a growing number of electronic devices that aren't traditional 
computers but are linked to the internet to exchange data, information, orders, and instructions. Today, the Internet of 
Things encompasses a vast array of 'things'. Internet-connected 'smart' versions of standard appliances such as 
refrigerators, televisions, light bulbs, and gadgets may exist only in an internet-enabled environment (Hossain 
2023c&f). Again, internet-enabled sensors are altering manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, distribution centers, 
the service sector, industry, farms, and other industries (Ann and Tim 2023). IoT, on the other hand, is a term that 
refers to the increasingly sophisticated ecosystems of online, linked devices with which we share our world. Today, 
almost any item we use in our homes, businesses, factories, or even wear on our bodies can be online and connected, 
giving rise to the term internet of things (INNS, 2023). IoT is a trend that is driving the increasing digitalization and 
datafication of society in many innovative and remarkable ways. 
IoT is a new information processing, acquisitional, and evaluation method, and it has been widely used in intelligent 
transportation, environmental monitoring, efficiency maximization, and other aspects of technologies and devices. 
Technological effectively integrate the infrastructure resources in communications, connectivity, management, 
marketing, finance, economy, engineering, medical, power system, environment aspect, and other service and 
industry-related things by the influenced and effective use of Iota (Liu Hua et al, 2014). So, most of the technologies 
and devices will be influenced by IoT in the 21st century. Companies and universities all across the world are interested 
in building Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, from Apple to Google to Facebook (Hossain 2023d&f). AI is crucial 
in many engineering fields. Furthermore, 2021 has seen numerous fascinating breakthroughs in the field of AI and 
machine learning (ML) (Garima 2023).  Healthcare devices represent one of the fastest-growing sectors of the IoT 
market. The value of this sector also known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is predicted to reach US$ 176 
billion by 2026.

Abstract 
The usefulness and promise of composite materials in various industrial contexts have received extensive attention 
in recent years. Chemical treatment and weight fraction modifications are the subject of this investigation into the 
shore hardness qualities in woven E-Glass, Woven Jute, and Kenaf Hybrid composite laminates. The key 
objectives are to analyze how the NaOH chemical treatment affects the laminate's hardness and how the fiber 
weight fraction affects stiffness. Our process entails making composite laminates in a range of circumstances, 
from raw to treated (NaOH), and from 20% to 25% by weight. Testing the Shore hardness of the laminates is a 
crucial tool for determining their stiffness. According to the findings, NaOH chemical treatment improves the 
shore hardness, which is useful for its enhanced rigidity. The importance of optimizing the weight fraction of the 
composite design is further emphasized by the fact that raising the weight fraction of fibers typically leads to 
improved hardness. This study elucidates the value of shore hardness testing for characterizing composites and 
evaluating the effects of treatment and weight fraction modification. Considering the importance of stiffness and 
durability in numerous fields, research has far-reaching consequences. The research also adds to the field of 
material engineering by advocating for environmentally friendly options by using natural fibers such jute and 
kenaf. In sum, the findings of this study deepen our knowledge of composite materials and pave the way for novel, 
eco-friendly materials and processes.

1. Introduction
Composites are widely used in todays industries because they can be molded into any shape and last far longer 
than their more conventional counterparts. They are indispensable across a wide range of industries. Thanks to 
their exceptional strength, longevity, and adaptability. Due in large part to their increased quality, durability, 
fatigue and corrosion resistance, and damage tolerance, composite materials are now the preferred choice over 
traditional metals for some aircraft machine parts (Nor et al. 2018). 
Composite materials made from natural fibers have gained popularity in current ages due to their durability and 
environmental friendliness. Natural fibers have cheaper production costs than their synthetic and carbon fiber 
counterparts; their densities are lower; their particular tensile properties are equivalent; they do not abrade 
equipment or skin; they use less energy; they pose less health hazards; and they can be renewed, recycled, and 
decomposed (Malkapuram et al. 2009). In addition, Recent studies have shown that natural fiber has the potential 
to be employed as reinforcing material in composites, ushering in an entirely novel phase of bio-composites that 
outperforms orientated Glass fiber reinforcement composites (GFRC) (Sanjay et al. 2015). 
The main goal of this study was to enhance the consequence resistance of composite laminates. The selection of 
kenaf, a type of natural fiber, as a suitable material for reinforcement was based on their renewable nature and 
environmentally benign attributes. To comprehensively examine the range of potential outcomes, this study

E-glass fibers improves the hardness properties to multiple orders with respect to the same configuration of hybrid 
composites having same natural fibers but chemically untreated. So, increase of fiber weight fraction, the Shore 
D hardness increased significantly since more fiber content made the composite stiffer which quite rigid and 
durable. Figure 8 shows the hardness we get from 20% and 25% weight fraction of both treated and untreated 
fibre composites. 
 
 
 
Figure 8. Hardness Shore D results of treated and untreated fibre composites 
 
The fibers used to make the composite laminates can either be raw or treated (NaOH) before being bonded 
together. The percentages 20% and 25% denote the fiber weight fractions of the composite materials. Here's a 
discussion of the results is provided: 
 
• 
Raw vs. Treated (NaOH): For each 20% and 25% weight fractions, treated (NaOH) has better shore 
hardness than raw. This suggests that NaOH treatment increases composite laminate hardness. 
• 
Weight Fraction Effect: Comparison of raw or treated (NaOH) conditions at different weight fractions 
shows that 25% has somewhat higher shore hardness than 20%. This suggests that composites with more 
fiber are harder. 
• 
Implications: Shore hardness indicates the composite laminate stiffness. Stiffness-sensitive applications 
like structural components prefer higher shore hardness ratings. NaOH treatment increases composite 
hardness, which may make them better for specific applications. The influence of the weight fraction 
upon shore hardness implies that fiber content can control composite mechanical characteristics. 
• 
Further Analysis: Tensile testing can link shore hardness to various mechanical parameters as tensile 
strength as well as modulus of elasticity. 
 
Shore hardness measures material stiffness, and our results show that both chemical treatment as well as weight 
fraction affect the composite laminate hardness. To obtain more definitive conclusions, compare shore hardness 
ratings for different fibre types and perform further mechanical testing to assess these composites performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the shore hardness study conducted on woven E-Glass, Woven Jute, and Kenaf Hybrid Composite 
Laminates has yielded significant findings. Notably, the treatment with NaOH was observed to enhance the 
composite laminate shore hardness consistently, surpassing the raw condition across weight fractions. Moreover, 
a general trend indicated that 25% weight fractions exhibited slightly greater shore hardness compared to 20%, 
highlighting the influence of fiber weight percentage on composite laminate hardness and stiffness. Although not 
explicitly stated in the data, variations in shore hardness among glass, jute, and kenaf fibers were likely observed, 
offering valuable insights for material selection in specific applications. This research underscores the utility of

shore hardness testing for evaluating composite laminates, enabling assessments of material stiffness and 
hardness, comparisons between treated and untreated fibers, and the optimization of fiber weight fractions for 
tailored mechanical properties. The implications of this study are far-reaching, spanning industries such as sports, 
automotive, construction, marine, aerospace equipment, and sustainability efforts, fostering innovation and eco-
conscious material choices while advancing the field of material engineering.

Derivation of a 3-degree Breakdown of Overall Operational 
Efficiency (OOE) to Identify the Main Factor of Non-
Efficiency in the RMG/Footwear Industry

Abstract 
Overall Operational Efficiency (OOE) is the key lever in the Apparel/Footwear Manufacturing industry today which 
drives the costing, productivity, and optimization of resources. Consequently, it is significant to determine the reasons 
for low OOE to mitigate the risk of higher cost, low productivity, and excess use of resources. In most of the cases, 
the common practice is to use the 1st Degree formula only to calculate OOE which is challenging in case of detecting 
the root cause for low efficiency. This study deals with this challenge by outlining the Three (3) degrees of Breakdown 
of OOE in a manufacturing unit that finally drives to decide which main factor to pull down the Efficiency is. The 
analytical approach formulates the 2nd & 3rd degree of OOE measurements by correlating all the possible parameters 
by using the conventional theory of OOE (1sr Degree ) and introduces the four possible factors of OOE: Availability 
Rate, Level of Performance, Quality Rate & Direct-Indirect labor Ratio. The correlation was proved later on by the 
data collection, data plotting on the derived formulas, and further analysis from a manufacturing unit. Finally, the 
macro level to micro level derivation illustrates how an Apparel/ Footwear manufacturing factory can identify the 
factors related to low Efficiency & take faster decisions on those factors to take the right actions to improve Efficiency.

1. Introduction
The Apparel & Footwear manufacturing industry has witnessed a massive growth in consumption of these products 
over the last few decades. American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA 2023) published a report that states: 
In 2022, the average American spent a record-breaking high of $1,143.29 for 68.5 pieces of clothing and $330.62 to 
buy 8.3 pairs of shoes. The report also highlights that The U.S. apparel and footwear industry contributed more than 
$490 billion in retail sales to the U.S. economy in 2022. The total market value was 1,102.57 Billion in 2021 and by 
2030, the projection is to reach USD 4,965.5 Billion growing at a CAGR of 18.2% from 2023 to 2030. (Verified 
Market Research 2023).  These statistics show how rapidly the consumption of apparel and footwear is growing year 
by year. With the increase in market demand, the production rate should also be increased at the same pace. However, 
the challenge is production rate is still lower than the market needs for apparel & footwear (Jayawardena 2020). 
Overall Operational Efficiency is the proper focal point to deal with this type of crisis. 
The production sector of the Apparel and Footwear industry has large numbers of problems every day, even every 
hour. So it is almost impossible to find every problem on the surface. Therefore, it is important to know the easiest 
method to dig down the problem to find the root cause. Like other measures, almost all the manufacturing units of 
Apparel and Footwear currently use the conventional formula for OOE, defined as 1st Degree of the Formula to 
measure OOE. The factors used in this formula can only measure the current level of Efficiency of a manufacturing 
unit. But, in the case of low efficiency, it hardly drives to the root cause because of the limitations of the parameters. 
This research helps to give this overview of the root causes of problems by giving more insight into the OOE formulas.

In the 2nd Degree OOE, we identified Level of Performance as the main factor to pull down the efficiency. But, we 
can identify which factors of Level of Performance are the main reasons for it. Considering the result from Table 6 
and Table 7, we can understand that Level of Performance of that line consists of three other factors. And here the 
result shows that, Line Balancing Ratio and SMV Performance are the root causes behind the low efficiency 36.7%. 
Also, the minimum standard value of Bottleneck performance is 100%. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research comes to an end with the formulation of two unique ways of calculating Operational Efficiency along 
with the conventional 1st degree formula. This 1st degree formula is widely used in almost all of the apparel or footwear 
factories today.  Due to this, most of the manufacturing units are unable to identify the root cause of having low 
efficiency which makes over utilization of resources thus the costing of the overall operations faces higher and higher 
levels. This research creates the scope to identify the root cause of low efficiency processes with a quick and logical 
approach that finally could save the apparel or footwear manufacturing industry from waste of resources and creates 
cost effectiveness. From the result we can sum up that from the 1st degree OOE, we can only measure the Operational 
performance by calculating the efficiency. But, when the result indicates the value is too low, it also highlights there 
are some problems going on with the production. But, from the 1st degree formula, it is difficult to know the real 
reason behind the problem. So, we finally derived the 2nd degree and after data plotting on the 2nd degree, we found 
the same Efficiency value as 1st degree. Firstly, this validates the 2nd degree OOE derivation and then, from the 
parameters, we found the problem is in the Level of Performance since, this value among the four parameters was the 
lowest. Breaking down the Level of Performance into Three more factors, we finally arrived at our 3rd degree of OOE. 
The 3rd degree also provides the same OOE which validates the 3rd degree derivation finally. And also, after plotting

required data into the breakdown of the Level of Performance formula, we see that the results are the same in Degree-
2 and Degree-3 of OOE. Finally, from the result, we successfully identified that Line Balancing Ratio, SMV 
Performance and Bottleneck performance are the main reasons behind the low efficiency we found on the 1st step of 
measuring OOE.

Abstract 
Sustainable and energy-saving transportation options such as electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly 
common in our society. This has extended not only to EVs but also to real-life transportation such as two-wheelers, 
bicycles, and scooters.  However, in many large cities, the limited capacity of batteries and the number of battery 
swapping stations (BSS) have led to an imbalance between demand and supply. Indeed, when drivers go to a BSS, 
there are many cases where the number of fully charged batteries is not available, or the BSS is relatively far away. 
Therefore, in this study, we propose a clustering-based recommendation system for electric two-wheeled vehicles. We 
first consider both temporal and spatial factors (place) to integrate the data by analyzing the demand by time of day 
for each day of the week in the region. After that, we perform ensemble clustering using BSS data installed for electric 
two-wheeled vehicles in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Korea. Finally, it recommends the BSS with the shortest distance 
without waiting time by considering the current time and location of the driver.

Abstract 
Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) represent a predominant occupational hazard within the global brick kiln industry. 
Poor working posture is one of the primary causes of musculoskeletal injuries in the workplace. This research is 
intended to investigate the working postures of brick-kiln workers and systematically evaluate the associated risk of 
injury. Digging, mud transferring, mixing clay, molding, and loading are the five main procedures that were considered 
to examine the working postures. Pictures of the various working processes were obtained using a portable camera. 
Two assessment tools RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) and REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment) were used 
to assess the ergonomic risks associated with brick-making processes. The results from this study identified digging, 
clay mixing, manual molding, and loading operations as high-risk operations due to the prevalent disregard for optimal 
working postures. In summation, this research underscores the pressing issue of musculoskeletal disorders in the brick 
kiln sector, primarily caused by suboptimal working postures. Carefully implementing RULA and REBA assessment 
tools has revealed specific duties with elevated injury risks. This research urges the consistent adoption of proper 
ergonomic postures by brick kiln workers, thus enhancing workplace safety and overall occupational well-being.

1. Introduction
Bangladesh has about 6,000 authorized brickfields and numerous illegal ones which collectively manufacture 
approximately 23 billion bricks annually(Saha and Rahman 2013). This thriving industry contributes around 1% to 
the country's GDP and provides employment opportunities for over a million individuals. Considering Bangladesh's 
population of 159.9 million and its current growth rate, an estimated 4 million new houses will need to be built each 
year to meet the housing demands of the growing populace, further propelling the growth of the brick sector (Climate 
and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants 2017). In this industry, most of the workers are 
uneducated. Moreover, there is a serious lack of proper professional training and awareness regarding safe and healthy 
work practices (Sain and Meena 2018). Working in adverse conditions results in various health issues and 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among brick kiln workers (Sain and Meena 2018). 
The brick industry typically entails a lot of manual labor and physically demanding activities. Although automation 
and other technology have decreased the amount of physical labor, manual labor tasks are still customary and 
frequently required in brick manufacturing processes. Numerous brick production chores such as clay preparation, 
manual molding, firing, cooling, etc. are frequently performed in hazardous and unmanaged environments, which 
increases the risk of accidents, illnesses, and fatalities, especially those connected to musculoskeletal disorders 
(MSDs). This study focuses on brick field workers to analyze the most problematic working postures in brick-making 
processes and identify the risk level of the respective process.

Figure 10 presents the distribution of laborers across varying risk levels as discerned through the analysis of RULA 
and REBA scores. The RULA score denoted that 49.52% of the workforce exhibited work postures classified as high-
risk, thereby underscoring the imperative for expeditious investigation and subsequent adjustments in posture. 
Furthermore, an alarming 43.08% of employees were ascertained to be at an elevated risk, warranting immediate 
interventions in posture to mitigate the likelihood of injury. Conversely, a mere 7.61% of personnel were exposed to 
a moderate level of risk attributable to suboptimal work postures. 
Conversely, the REBA assessment methodology pinpointed unnatural postures and excessive repetitive movements in 
the arm, wrist, and elbow regions as contributory factors to reported injuries. In accordance with the REBA assessment, 
an overwhelming 62.85% of the workforce was categorized as harboring a high risk of developing Musculoskeletal 
Disorders (MSDs), while 28.58% of individuals were found to be susceptible to a very high risk of MSDs owing to 
their precarious work postures. To summarize, both assessment modalities yielded congruent results, underscoring the 
prevalence of unsatisfactory work postures among the majority of laborers. 
 
The findings of this research can be summarized as: Hand pain was the highest reported pain during mud transferring 
(38.8%) and hand pain was the 2nd highest reported pain during digging process (28%) and clay mixing process 
(17.24%). Lower back pain was the highest reported pain during digging (35.5%), clay mixing (44.53%), manual 
molding (27.58%) process. The tasks of digging, manual molding, and clay mixing are the most concerning and high-
risk activities, with RULA scores of 7, 6, and 7, respectively. Additionally, these tasks have REBA scores ranging 
from 8 to 10, , indicating a high level of risk. It is crucial to promptly investigate these issues and take necessary steps 
to lower the risk levels of RULA and REBA.  
6. Conclusion 
Bangladesh is the world's fourth-largest brick producer. More than 1 million people are working in different brick 
plants. In ten years, the number of brick kilns will probably rise by 2 to 3 percent due to population growth(Saha and 
Rahman 2013).The process of brick production is inherently physically demanding, and laborers engaged in this 
occupation frequently encounter a spectrum of work-related injuries. Within the realm of occupational hazards, it is 
noteworthy that the brick kiln industry ranks among the most perilous occupations globally, marked by the highest 
injury rates. Among these injuries, musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) predominate as the most prevalent nonfatal 
occupational injuries and ailments among workers, particularly those who engage in labor-intensive activities inherent 
to brick production, encompassing tasks such as brick firing, as well as the loading and unloading of bricks. This study 
was conducted to ascertain and analyze the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among laborers engaged in brick 
manufacturing activities in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The research primarily aimed to identify the musculoskeletal effects 
associated with each specific task involved in brick production, and subsequently determine the potential postures 
linked to these issues. Furthermore, the study conducted a risk analysis of postures assumed during each brick 
production operation using the RULA-REBA analysis. This enabled the identification of precarious postures that 
potentially contributed to musculoskeletal issues.

Abstract 
Optimizing operational effectiveness while maintaining product quality is essential in the changing steel companies. 
This study explores Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) in the context of steel production, highlighting how it 
contributes to increased Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) by removing inefficiencies. The most significant losses, 
mostly Chemistry/Scrap, and a few others are identified by PARETO analysis. This research uses in-depth analysis of 
the steel manufacturing process to not only identify significant causes of total delays and faults but also to identify the 
root causes with countermeasures of significant losses using the WWBLA (Why-Why Because Logical Analysis) 
method. The countermeasures found in the WWBLA have reduced overall delays and total faults, resulting in an 
increase in OEE from 79.5% to 80.5%. This study emphasizes the importance of TPM as an important tool for 
improving productivity, sustainability, and competitiveness in the steel manufacturing industry by integrating it with 
structured analytical methods.

1. Introduction
The steel melting sector in Bangladesh, which is a dynamic and ever-evolving field, must prioritize operational 
efficiency to remain competitive in the global market. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is an aggressive method 
that focuses on improving the function and design of manufacturing equipment. Seiichi Nakajima in the 1960s 
pioneered a quantitative metric called Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) 
in any manufacturing to accelerate productivity and help to identify the actual loggers. OEE was developed by three 
important aspects availability, performance, and quality. Availability identifies the quantity of time when the machine 
is running is determined by subtracting machine downtime from the projected operating time, performance is 
described as the comparison of the speed at which the machine runs to the ideal cycle time, and quality is defined as 
the number of good components produced and also comprises flaws made during startup as well as those produced 
while the machine is in stable production. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is at the vanguard of this endeavor, a 
complete system that goes beyond standard maintenance procedures to improve total equipment efficacy. Saureng

6. Results and Discussion
To achieve all Predictive Maintenance (TPM) excellence, a thorough Pareto analysis revealed that the main causes 
of almost 72% of all losses in a steel melting unit were Chemistry/Scrap, Material Unavailability, Transfer Car, and 
Crane Problem. Strategic countermeasures, including improved communication procedures, proactive cleaning 
measures, continual sponge iron availability, and focused training activities, were quickly put into place using the 
WWBLA approach for root cause analysis. The observable efficacy of these interventions was demonstrated by a 
noteworthy 1.26% enhancement in Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), underscoring the influential function of 
TPM techniques in addressing key operational obstacles and enhancing efficiency. This research demonstrates the 
value of methodical analysis and focused interventions in bringing about significant improvements in industrial 
processes, which is in line with the overarching objective of maximizing equipment performance and guaranteeing 
long-term efficiency in the steel production plant. 
7. Conclusion
In conclusion, this research pointed to the application of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) within the context of 
a steel-making melting plant. The utilization of the 80/20 rule proved instrumental in pinpointing critical issues 
affecting the unit's availability, performance, and quality. After the identification of these major factors, strategic 
countermeasures were implemented to address and rectify the root causes. The success of this approach is reflected in 
the improved efficiency of the steel plant's equipment. By focusing on preventive and predictive maintenance, the 
study underscores the significance of proactive strategies in minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity. This 
research not only points to the knowledge of TPM but also provides practical insights for industrial practitioners 
seeking to optimize their operational processes. In essence, the findings highlight the transformative potential of TPM 
as a methodology for achieving sustainable improvements in equipment reliability and overall operational 
effectiveness within steel manufacturing units.

Abstract 
The expanding manufacturing sector of plastic items is coming about because of the injection molding process 
and the quick advancement of existing innovation. One of the most time-consuming, non-value-added tasks in a 
manufacturing process is setup, or changeover. The study was conducted at a plastic product manufacturing 
company in Bangladesh. This study's goal was to demonstrate how changeover time reduction approaches may 
be used in a medium-sized production facility to cut down on total process lead time with the assistance of lean 
manufacturing tools. The analysis of numerous factors, including non-conformities, complaints, and delivery 
delays, revealed improvement prospects. In this research, three cases were considered for reducing overall 
changeover time: one is Reduce 7 Wastes (Case 1), the second is Improve SMED with 5S and 7 Wastes (Case 2), 
and the third is Total Change Over Works, which can be classified into external and internal works (Case 3). After 
implementing improvement measures, changeover time was reduced by 18%–33%. The most essentially 
decreased changeover time was 33% compared to the result for case 2, and they improved their main 
manufacturing line's output capacity by 10% by focusing on lean tools (5S, SMED, 7 waste). The company was 
able to avoid using temporary workers due to this development since it allowed employees to work longer hours 
during peak times. The study also explores how these techniques may be used in other major manufacturing 
industries that engage in mass production at several worldwide locations, in addition to a medium-sized facility.

1. Introduction
This study was developed out of the requirement for improving specific processes in a plastic manufacturing plant 
because of the greater expectations from their main customer. The majority of the items we use in our day-to-day 
lives require a few segments or even themselves to be created by the extruding process. That is the reason it 
additionally requires a generous amount of time to get the primary, great-quality item in its original shape after a 
changeover. Due to these troubles, there is an inclination to pick enormous clump creation with fewer 
changeovers, in actuality. Improvement of changeover times, supporting accomplishments, and doing this in a 
precise and normalized way are pivotal for the productivity of the firm (Cakmakci and Karasu 2007). Till now, 
the most renowned instrument for changeover time decrease is the SMED. Yet, this approach appears to be open 
for additional improvement of the longest piece of a changeover activity, ''preliminary attempts; furthermore, 
changes'' where another insightful strategy needs to be locked in to limit the time required for boundary changes 
(Karasu et al. 2014). The considerations that are being provided focus on the optimization of the manufacturing 
approach by applying the SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) technique to a chosen spare component. By 
reducing production delays and responding to changing orders more quickly, the SMED approach aims to 
strengthen the ability to quickly adjust to changing customer demands from the perspective of the Lean 
Manufacturing philosophy (Niekurzak et al. 2023). The goal of lean manufacturing is to find and remove waste 
at every stage of a product's manufacturing cycle (Saha and Mahmud  2022). A manufacturing system with short 
changeover times may help reduce the lot size. It has various advantages, including decreased costs, accelerated 
production, greater productivity, decreased lead times, smooth process flows, a wider variety of lot sizes, less 
inventory, and decreased waste (Ahmad and Soberi  2018). SMED, a quality-control concept, has been extensively

The examination of the information and data assembled prompted huge improvements to be completed in three 
classes, to be specific: procedural, mechanical, and organizational, to carry out mold setup time reductions. 
Procedural improvements are intended to examine the effectiveness of the strategies utilized to complete an 
arrangement. Tables 8 and 9 show the outcomes of workflow modifications based on the SMED idea, where 
internal tasks are changed to external activities, resulting in a quicker change over time. By using this approach, 
we can reduce die change over time by approximately 26% to 33% in the extrusion time. According to Case 2, it 
is a very time-reducing method, and by using this approach, we can reduce die change over time by approximately 
18% in the extrusion time for each overall die changeover time.

The aims of this project were to decrease the changeover time, increase production, reduce inventory, and deliver 
products on schedule. The plastic manufacturing process, flow injection molding, and the accepted standards 
Procedures must be completely comprehended. Execution of SMED could decrease the changeover time by 18%- 
33%. The most essentially decreased changeover time was 33% comparison of result for case- 2. To make this 
examination, there we propose things that might be utilized in further examinations. The decrease of changeover 
time may altogether increment on the off chance that we put resources into mechanical apparatuses, particularly 
utilized for inward exercises. The effect of a decreased changeover time can be examined further, particularly

Abstract 
To overcome the increasing price and various operational issues, the 'Benefit-Sharing Model' can be an ideal solution 
as it improves resource optimization and maximizes cost efficiency. In particular, a Japan-Bangladesh joint venture 
medical device manufacturing company had been making loss since its inception. It reported an annual net profit for 
the first time after the introduction of the 'Benefit-Sharing Model' in the supply chain operations of the organization. 
Price fluctuations, limited supplier sources, below-par planning process and less supplier collaboration were resulting 
in continuous business losses which the company needed to solve to ensure profitability. Here we discuss the 
utilization of a strategic model to improve process parameters and resource optimization with ideal EOQ which was 
adjusted with supplier MOQ ensuring perpetual shipments. Furthermore, shipment optimization to achieve cost 
effectiveness, research opportunities for slow moving material and Covid impact minimization are reported in this 
paper. Utilizing this overall approach, raw-material price reduced 6% and a smooth order trend was achieved which 
reduced 41% inventory holding cost, 24% lead time, 67% port demurrage cost and increased capacity utilization by 
25%. In addition, R&D development to utilize slow-moving quantity reduced purchase by 7% and new source 
development reduced cost 45%. Moreover, during Covid period, future risk assessment and strategic business 
negotiation helped to secure business from high freight and price hike up to 9 months and increased order by 20%. 
Overall, this model and the strategic approach helped the company to achieve annual net profit for the first time in 8 
years.

Abstract 
Musculoskeletal diseases can be dependent on numerous environmental and individual factors. The existing methods 
leave out several important factors during the calculation of risks. Hence, this paper has the purpose to create and 
examine a way for employees to estimate their own risk of developing musculoskeletal problems employing the 
Musculoskeletal Disease Risk Factor Assessment (MDRFA) approach. Exactly 112 male cement manufacturing 
workers participated in this cross-sectional investigation. Participants were interviewed to acquire data about their 
own possessions. Information on the objects was gleaned through perceiving their work and talking to them. 
Additionally, they were given the Cornell questionnaires for musculoskeletal pain and instructed to complete them 
out in Persian (CMDQ). A model was developed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) effect coefficients. This 
technique was verified using a linear regression analysis, and the final score was categorized using the Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC). The musculoskeletal symptoms are seen to be considerably influenced by either the 
individual's own characteristics (total coefficient of 0.27) or by physical (total coefficient of 0.51) and psychological 
(total coefficient of 0.11). Items' computed coefficients were utilized to formulate the MDRFA equation. The ideal 
cut-off values for the final score of the approach were 14.32, 18.56, and 22.59, creating four distinct categories. The 
MDRFA approach could adequately explain 73% of risks, but the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) approach 
could only justify 51% of risks. Prediction of musculoskeletal disorders relies heavily on personal, physical and 
psychological characteristics. This methodology may allow for more precise prediction of the occurrence of certain 
diseases.

1. Introduction
The human body's musculoskeletal system is an intricate framework of muscle groups, ligaments, tendons, bones, and 
other connective tissue components that work together in order to provide mobility, stability, and support (Araújo et 
al. 2019; Schram et al. 2020). The system has the responsibility of performing physical activities such as walking, 
running, climbing, and carrying matrices. This system can be distorted due to poor posture, overexertion, exposure to 
repetitive force, lifting heavy weight, vibrations, etc. (Yang et al. 2020; Mondal et al. 2022). Musculoskeletal diseases 
are caused by this distortion, which causes pain or damage to the musculoskeletal system (MSDs). Muscles, tendons, 
bones, and associated structures including the lower spine can all be affected by a group of treated conditions known 
as musculoskeletal disorders (Ghasemi et al. 2020). It is a major cause of long-term impairment, missed work owing 
to illness, low productivity, and an inferior standard of life (Falahati et al. 2019; Khoshakhlagh et al. 2017). MSD 
disorders do not appear suddenly; they develop slowly and reveal various signs.  When MSDs first begin to develop, 
the body of an individual will experience discomfort following work. (Black, Hawks, and Keene, 2009). If this 
indication is ignored for a long period of time, strains begin to build up throughout the body, resulting in discomfort 
in various body limbs such as the shoulder, neck, elbow, upper and lower back, and extremities (knee, forearms, feet, 
fingers, hands and so on) (Whysall, 2006; Kumar et al. 2018). If the remedy is not performed effectively, the person

Abstract 
This research aims to improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals by identifying obstacles in an indoor 
environment using a solution approach. The approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features 
and detect objects from real-time video. A head-mounted image acquisition device detects objects and provides audio 
information to the visually impaired. The system processes live video streams frame-by-frame, processing each frame 
as separate images. The authors incorporate additional variables into a novel two-step iterative approach to solve 
complex computer vision problems. The proposed method improves computational efficiency and accuracy, opening 
up promising avenues for future research. The paper also presents a new mathematical formulation of curve and 
surface reconstitute algorithms by introducing auxiliary variables. Moving object detection is crucial for intelligent 
video monitoring systems, as it allows for accurate extraction of foreground objects. This paper aims to detect real 
moving objects from un-stationary backgrounds, limiting false negatives and achieving maximum application 
independence. The model and motion of the target objects are assumed to be unknown. Introduce a new mathematical 
formulation for curve and surface reconstruction algorithms, introducing auxiliary variables and minimizing energy. 
This approach transforms an implicit data constraint into an explicit convex reconstruction problem, simplifying it. 
The formulation also allows for more precise parameter settings, ensuring convergence to a minimum. And 
demonstrate the properties and results of this new auxiliary problem, mainly when the potential is a function of the 
distance to the closest feature point.

1. Introduction
Video surveillance is crucial in computer vision, analyzing video sequences for data storage and display. Intelligent 
visual surveillance (IVS) is an automated process that analyzes and interprets object behaviors, detects and tracks 
moving objects, and provides information extraction in various computer vision applications. However, vision loss is 
becoming more common, with 314 million people suffering from visual disabilities worldwide. As people age, the 
danger of visual impairments increases, complicating independent mobility. Identifying obstacles without vision is 
challenging, and a comprehensive framework is needed to help people with visual disabilities. Traditional tools like 
guide canes have limitations, such as distance, and a computerized system that recognizes objects without touching 
them and provides auditory feedback is needed. Many problems in Computer Vision involve minimizing energy, 
usually solved by gradient descent using an iterative scheme. This work introduces auxiliary variables to define a two-
variable point for shape extraction and reconstruction, allowing for the transformation of implicit data constraints into 
reconstruction with regularization of explicit data. The paper also reviews recently proposed GAN models and their 
applications in computer vision, comparing classic GAN algorithms and evaluating network construction, 
performance, and applicability (Mehmood et al. 2023). Vision loss is becoming more common, with 314 million 
people suffering from visual disabilities worldwide. Uncorrected refractive errors or eye conditions are the leading 
causes of visual impairment, with 45 million visually impaired. As people age, the danger of visual impairments 
increases, complicating independent mobility. Identifying obstacles without vision is challenging, as the VI person

not only competes with but also outperforms these methods in most cases. This supports the premise that the 
integration of auxiliary variables with two-step iterative algorithms holds significant promise for advancing the field 
of computer vision. The research's primary contribution is the novel integration. 
 
The study suggests enhancing computer vision efficiency and accuracy, especially for large-scale, high-dimensional 
data processing. However, limitations include the choice of auxiliary variables and the convergence rate of the two-
step iterative algorithm. Future research should explore the method's application to other computer vision domains 
and consider adaptations to the two-step iterative algorithm.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The proposed ODMVI architecture aims to assist visually impaired people by achieving object detection through pre-
processing, segmentation, feature extraction, optimal feature selection, and object detection. The model's accuracy 
and precision were better than those of existing models like CNN + PSO, CNN+WOA, CNN +GWO, and 
CNN+SLnO. The research presents a novel approach for addressing complex computer vision problems by integrating 
auxiliary variables and two-step iterative algorithms. The method significantly improved computational efficiency 
and solution accuracy in object detection, image reconstruction, and semantic segmentation tasks. The method's 
effectiveness may vary depending on the choice of additional variables and their relationship with the original 
variables. The convergence rate of the two-step iterative algorithm requires further investigation across different 
problem contexts. The proposed model is designed to assist visually impaired people daily. 
 
7. Future Work 
The study explores the application of a proposed method for computer vision tasks, including object tracking, action 
recognition, and facial recognition. It also suggests improvements in the two-step iterative algorithm and the 
optimization of auxiliary variables. The study also suggests assessing the method's performance on more extensive 
and diverse datasets and combining it with other techniques like deep learning algorithms. The study also examines 
the accuracy of software defect predictions using five NASA data sets. The results show that feature selection 
techniques can improve the Bayesian net algorithm's accuracy rate by an average of 8%, while the Logistic Regression 
algorithm's best accuracy is over 93%. Future research could explore further methods for high accuracy and examine 
the effects of metaheuristic feature selection techniques. 
 
Future work will optimize detection time and provide audio notifications, with an Android app for smartphone video 
capture and a backend server for real-time object detection.

Abstract 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a data-driven process improvement approach for waste minimization, cost-effective 
processing, and increasing overall performance. This study proposes a Bayesian Best Worst Method (BBWM) 
approach to rank critical failure factors inhibiting the implementation of Lean Six Sigma in the dairy processing 
industry. BBWM is an advanced Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Method (MCDM) that incorporates the subjective 
judgment of decision-makers to reduce the uncertainty and complexity of the decision-making process. The study is 
based on the Bangladeshi dairy processing industry. Four main criteria are found through an extensive literature review 
and experts’ opinions. These four main criteria have been ranked using BBWM. Each major criteria are divided into 
sub-criteria which are also ranked using the same approach. This study will be helpful for further analysis of LSS 
applications in the dairy processing industry.

1. Introduction
The incorporation of approaches that optimize productivity and reduce waste has become critical in the dynamic realm 
of industrial operations. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a leader in this field, providing a strong data-driven methodology 
for process optimization. Increasing bottom-line performance is LSS's principal goal. Two commonly used continuous 
improvement tools in businesses today are lean management and Six Sigma techniques (Alfaro et al. 2020). The use 
of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) has the potential to transform operational procedures, especially in sectors like dairy 
processing where accuracy, economy, and overall performance are critical. However, several crucial failure reasons 
frequently obstruct the smooth use of Lean Six Sigma concepts, making it difficult to realize this potential.    
This research investigates the challenges of implementing Lean Six Sigma in Bangladesh's dairy processing industry, 
a crucial sector for the nation's economy. No study has been found where the critical factors inhibiting the 
implementation of LSS in the dairy processing industry have been ranked and no generic study has been found on 
critical factors for implementing LSS in Bangladeshi dairy industries. So, it aims to identify and rank the unique 
factors preventing the successful integration of Lean Six Sigma in the dairy processing sector using the Bayesian Best 
Worst Method (BBWM) as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making technique to assess and prioritize significant failure 
reasons in the dairy processing sector in Bangladesh. This method of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is based 
on pairwise comparisons and aggregates the preferences of several experts or decision-makers using a probabilistic

Bayesian BWM approach allowed for the integration of expert judgments and the consideration of multiple criteria, 
leading to a comprehensive assessment and ranking of the critical failure factors. The identified factors serve as crucial 
reference points for organizations in the dairy industry, providing guidance on areas that require attention and 
improvement to enhance LSS implementation outcomes. 
 
However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the study. The findings may not be fully generalizable due 
to the small sample or potential biases in the selection process. Another limitation is associated with the data collection 
method employed in the study. Surveys or interviews may introduce biases, self-reporting errors, or interpretation 
variations, impacting the reliability and validity of the findings. The subjectivity in the ranking process of critical 
failure factors, influenced by individual perspectives and biases, is another limitation that may affect the robustness 
of the results. Additionally, the study's focus on a specific set of factors may limit the comprehensiveness of the 
findings, as there could be additional factors not included in the research. 
The outcomes of future research efforts can contribute to enhancing the understanding of LSS implementation in 
various contexts, provide insights into effective decision-making methods, and support organizations in optimizing 
their implementation strategies.

Abstract 
Bakery is a major and important business in Bangladesh. By addressing the global concern of musculoskeletal 
disorders (MSDs) in the workplace, with a specific focus on their impact on bakery workers, who face heightened risk 
due to the physically demanding nature of their tasks. The study, conducted in Sylhet, Bangladesh, delves into the 
prevalence of MSDs and their associated risk factors within a selected bakery. It systematically explores the frequency 
of MSDs among bakery workers, emphasizing regions such as the back, shoulders, hands, wrists, and knees etc. 
Furthermore, it investigates the connection between occupational risk variables. A questionnaire-based interview was 
conducted to collect data from determined sample size as it was a cross-sectional study. Data were analysed using 
SPSS 26.0 version software and Microsoft Excel. The Chi-square test was employed to determine the significant 
association between multiple parameters and several musculoskeletal effects during various production operations 
Findings revealed distinct pain patterns across various job categories, with cleaning workers experiencing higher rates 
of neck and lower back pain, while dough preparation staff reported elevated shoulder and wrist/hand pain. Age 
emerged as a significant factor, impacting the nature of discomfort among younger and older workers. These findings 
stress the need for proactive measures to address the prevalence of MSDs and improve workplace conditions in the 
bakery industry.

1. Introduction
Musculoskeletal disorders form a significant source of morbidity within the workforce (Bernard 1997; Lang et al. 
2012; Woolf & Pfleger 2004). Globally, a large amount, over 40%, of workplace-related injury and illness expenses 
are ascribed to musculoskeletal problems (Abledu et al. 2014; Sharples & Shorrock 2014). This problem has been 
identified as ubiquitous across both low- and high-income nations (Choobineh et al. 2009; Shahnavaz 1987). In high-
income countries, approximately 30% of the workforce contends with working conditions that either trigger or 
exacerbate musculoskeletal issues, while in Global South countries, this percentage rises to an alarming 50% to 70% 
(Kang et al. 2014; Landry et al. 2008). Notably, musculoskeletal discomfort has been observed across numerous 
occupational categories, including industrial employees, clerks, data processors, and bakery workers, underlining its 
pervasive impact (Idler & Benyamini,1997; Melhorn 1998). 
Given its pervasiveness, musculoskeletal discomfort presents a serious concern, resulting to chronic pain, absenteeism, 
and protracted impairment (Lang et al. 2012; Woolf & Pfleger 2004). The physical features of employment are well-
established contributors to the occurrence of musculoskeletal discomfort. Rapid work pace, substantial physical 
workload, repetitive and forceful manual actions, extended periods in awkward postures, and exposure to whole-body 
vibration have all shown positive correlations with the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain (Neupane et al. 2013). 
Over the past two decades, research into the relationship between psychosocial factors and the manifestation and 
severity of musculoskeletal pain has flourished, identifying these associations across diverse occupational contexts 
(Bongers et al. 2002; Neupane et al. 2013; Waters et al. 2007). Karasek (1979) job strain model presents a theoretical 
framework clarifying the link between occupational psychosocial pressures and musculoskeletal discomfort. In 
instances of high strain, typified by heightened levels of control, severe psychological and physiological effects,

Abstract 
Turkish Super League matchday assignments have been criticized heavily over the years by the stakeholders with 
arguments regarding economic losses and performance issues. With the objective to improve upon the current 
scheduling effort by the federation, we develop a multi-objective approach to achieve dynamically fair matchday 
assignments throughout season that also accounts for the rest time between consecutive matches. Given the seasonal 
fixture, we develop a nonlinear binary integer program that is solved optimally for each round feeding information on 
previous rounds. Our results offer promising improvements over the existing schedule generating better results when 
a greater degree of weight is given to seasonal matchday distribution fairness rather than obtaining ideal rest time.

1. Introduction
Applications of operations research on sports scheduling have gradually become more and more common over the 
last two decades. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of state-of-the-art linear and non-linear programming 
methodologies in arranging tournament fixtures of this huge enterprise. Arguably, the best measure of the popularity 
of these tournaments is the multi-billion-dollar worth of the top sports clubs and enormous payments made for 
broadcasting rights. It is largely due to this popularity that game schedules are critical elements of the entire 
organization. Unfortunately, determination of these schedules is no easy undertaking because it should strike a 
reasonable balance between the often-conflicting demands of the stakeholders in the presence of a wide variety of 
constraints. This is indeed where operations research has made some impact. 
Broadly speaking, the problem we discuss in this article is the improvement of matchday schedules in soccer. This is 
a problem with two phases: the first phase is the determination of the seasonal fixture where we identify games to be 
played in each round of the tournament whereas the second phase is the assignment of each game to specific time 
slots. There is no easy solution because we need to satisfy a multitude of criteria in each phase of this problem. Among 
the criteria that have been commonly considered in previous work are carryover effect which is related to a potential 
performance reduction caused by a successive play with relatively strong opponents, breaks that occur when two home 
or away matches are scheduled consecutively, and the rest mismatches that are observed when the rest periods of 
participating teams vary. The main concerns that lead to the formulation of these criteria are somewhat related and 
cannot be accounted for independently from each other. However, fulfillment of the first two criteria is more often a

As far as the matchday deviations are concerned, a similar picture emerges in Table 1 except several final rounds of 
the season. As indicated previously, matchday deviations are calculated from the ideal (5, 12, 12, 5) seasonal 
distribution.  
The values of the total rest deviation and matchday deviation for each scenario are given in Table 2. OPT-4 and OPT-
5 present the two extremes where we minimize only the matchday deviation metric or only the rest deviation metric, 
respectively. Intuitively minimum for those metrics are obtained in OPT-4 for the seasonal matchday distribution and 
in OPT-5 for the rest deviation. OPT-3, which prioritizes the minimization of matchday deviation over the 
minimization of rest deviation, yields the minimal total deviation. It is also worth noting that OPT-4 and OPT-5 result 
in almost the same objective function value. Our formulation of the matchday determination problem generates 
solutions under all scenarios from OPT-1 to OPT-5 that significantly outperform the TFF solution in terms of total 
deviation.

5. Conclusions 
Fair assignment of matchdays throughout the soccer season in Turkey has been an active point of debate for more than 
a decade. Participating teams of the top Turkish soccer league have expressed their demand for an improved matchday 
schedule in each round of the season raising economic as well as performance concerns caused by the current match 
assignments. This paper seeks to offer a solution by addressing both concerns. The proxy used to measure the 
economic balance between the teams is deviation from an ideal seasonal matchday distribution that is equally applied 
to all participants of the league. Regarding performance, we use a proxy metric that is employed to compute the 
deviation for each team from some ideal rest time since the last match. Round-by-round minimization of the weighted 
average of those metrics in a dynamic sequence of calculations by making use of all historic matchday schedule 
information is the method we propose in this study. 
The results indicate that the dynamic round-by-round solution approach improves upon the TFF schedule. The best 
outcome from our analysis is obtained when seasonal matchday distribution metric gets a higher weight in 
minimization of the deviations. This suggests that maintaining a balance in terms of rest time at the expense of fair 
assignment of matchdays may challenge efforts to succeed in the latter objective. The trade-off between the two 
objectives measured similarly by their associated deviation metrics should be well communicated to the stakeholders 
to reduce potential objections.  
We also recognize that further refinements could be made to our solution approach in the future to enhance its ability 
to generate better schedules. Instead of a strict round-by-round solution approach, one may also solve for multiple 
rounds if information flows in a way to remove uncertainty for several rounds. This should bring not only fairer 
schedules, but also offer better visibility to the participating teams. Another extension could be the determination of 
the entire fixture under the set of objectives. Although fixture determination problem has been studied extensively in 
the literature, matchday determination has been disregarded. We believe future work should fill this gap as well.

Abstract 
The consumption of guinea pig meat has been increasing in recent years in the Andean regions. The objective of this 
research was to analyze how the variables that make up the guinea pig meat market and the actors associated with it 
are characterized and interrelated. Under an exploratory and descriptive non-experimental scope and by means of the 
MICMAC tool (matrix of crossed impacts), a structural analysis was carried out to identify the level of dependence 
and influence of the variables of the system, which were agreed upon by a select group of specialists; as well as their 
interdependence with the main stakeholders involved.  The results obtained show that the variables with the greatest 
impact on the market - and whose control would make it possible to optimize the functioning of the system - are linked 
to customary celebrations, consumption habits and the increase in the employment rate due to guinea pig raising. One 
of the most influential actors is the media, due to its significant impact on the behavior of the three previous variables, 
as well as on other relevant actors within the market. This research is a starting point for the strategic planning process 
of the market behavior of this type of meat in the Andean regions of South America.

1. Introduction
According to Guerrero et al. (2020), guinea pig meat is distinguished by its precocity and dietary flexibility, which, 
together with its extraordinary quality, make it an important food in people’s diets, being able to compete with other 
domestic consumption species. Similarly, in agreement with Flores et al. (2018), this meat is characterized by its high 
nutritional content, as it is low in fat, has a minimum percentage of sodium, and has a high amount of protein, making 
it ideal to be included in a balanced diet suitable for people of any age and to be consumed in different physiological 
situations. The different eating habits have been changing in recent years; therefore, these should be adapted to easy 
preparation and should present ample opportunity for purchase in the markets (Estrada and Velastegui 2021). For this 
reason, the food security of the population must be guaranteed. Under Ortiz-Oblitas et al. (2021), this term is 
interpreted as the physical, social, and economic access to convenient quantities of food that are both safe and 
nutritious to adequately cover the nutritional needs of a healthy life. 
Based on the above, the alternative of consuming this type of meat arises as an option to be able to meet the demand 
for food in the market. For this reason, this research seeks to analyze how the variables that make up the guinea pig 
meat market in the Andean region are characterized and interrelated. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), an animal 
native to the Andes of Peru and Bolivia, was trained by humans since ancestral times (Cantaro et al., 2021) in order 
to use it mainly as a food source (Segarra 2018); Peru being the country that enjoys the largest population of this 
species (Lucas et al. 2018). Currently, the Inca country is the largest producer and consumer of guinea pig meat in the 
world (Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation 2019). According to the National Agricultural Survey (ENA 2017), 
around 18 million guinea pigs are raised through traditional family units.

Abstract 
The most challenging task of the Covid-19 pandemic is the accurate detection of Covid-19 affected people. To fight 
against this challenge, automatic detection of Covid-19 can help to diagnose patients with more reliability. In this 
work, we have collected chest X-rays of Covid-19 affected patients and processed the dataset for training purpose. As 
we have imbalanced datasets as well as data scarcity for Covid-19 class, these might create problems during training 
of deep neural networks. To overcome that, we have tried to develop a simple CNN model by hyperparameter 
optimization so that this shallow network can give better results in case of data limitation. Later we compared the 
performance of our developed model and the existing VGG16 model. Our model has an overall accuracy of 88.12% 
whereas the VGG16 model has an accuracy of 84.34%.

1. Introduction
Global pandemic novel coronavirus (Covid-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2) has been started since Dec 8, 2019 which was first detected in Wuhan, China. Patients show symptoms 
like dry cough, sore throats and fever and eventually develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), acute respiratory failure and other serious complications (Chen et al. 2020). Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is 
used to detect Covid-19 virus by taking samples from nose, throat and lungs. Diagnosing Covid-19 affected patients 
at early stage is now a challenging issue.  Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a widely 
accepted diagnostic test, requires extraction of the RNA from patient’s samples, which also gives false negative result 
as accuracy depends on the preparation and manufacturing of RT-PCR test kits and good laboratory practice (Feng et 
al. 2020).  As there is scarcity of this test kit, chest x-ray and CT-scan are other options to detect Covid-19. According 
to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI), patients with oxygen saturations <92% or respiratory rate >20 
breaths/min, or patients with marked respiratory symptoms should have chest radiograph as a part of their initial 
assessment (Cleverley et al. 2020). Pneumonia developed in Covid-19 patients causes the density of the lungs to 
increase which is seen as ground glass opacity or whiteness in the lungs on radiography. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
can help the radiologists to detect Covid-19 affected patients from chest x-ray images accurately in less time.  
2. Literature Review
Automatic disease detection and classification with Deep Learning method such as Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN), has extensive applications in medical image processing, such as classification of benign and malignant tumors 
(Han et al. 2020), pneumonia detection (Varshni et al. 2019), segmentation of skin lesion (Iranpoor et al. 2020) and 
many more. Already, several works of Covid-19 detection have been published where both CT and chest X-ray images 
were used. Due to high cost and radiation exposure, CT is not suitable for Covid-19 screening though CT gives more 
accurate detection results in several studies (Sodickson et al. 2009). However, chest X-Ray imaging (CXR) is cost-

5. Conclusion 
To reduce the spreading of corona virus, early detection and the isolation of the Covid-19 positive people is the first 
priority. Automatic Covid-19 detection will reduce the detection time and help the doctors to identify Covid-19 
affected people more accurately. In this work, we developed a model with three blocks of feature extraction layers. 
Best combination of the layers was found out by varying the number of Conv2d and Pooling Layers in each block 
keeping the filters and kernel size fixed. Later best result found out by varying the filters and kernel size. The 
developed model has overall accuracy of 98.06% and validation accuracy of 88.75% whereas the VGG16 model gives 
84.38% accuracy. Our developed model on our collected data has shown accuracy of 95.06%. So, we can hope that 
our model can help the doctors to detect the Covid-19 patients more accurately and preciously. One of the 
achievements from this study is the collection and preparation of dataset of Covid-19 chest X-ray and making it 
publicly available for further use and study. All the images are publicly available at: https://shorturl.at/guzHT.

Abstract 
In this experimental work, focuses on the investigation of the effect of cutting parameters on surface Roughness 
and to minimize surface roughness. A CNC lathe machine has conducted the experiments. Dry turning tests are 
carried out on hardened steel with coated carbide cutting tools. This study sought to give systematic and 
trustworthy techniques for manufacturers and engineers to efficiently optimize machining parameters, tool 
selection, and process conditions by using Taguchi Design Optimization. The experiments revealed that the most 
favorable combination of cutting parameters, which resulted in a minimum surface roughness of 2.6 µm, 
corresponded to a cutting speed (V) of 120 m/min, a feed rate (F) of 0.2 mm/rev, and a depth of cut (D) of 0.08 
mm, yielding an S/N ratio of -8.29947. The utilization of coated tools has been identified as beneficial for 
enhancing the machining of hard materials when employing higher speeds and reduced feed rates. The findings 
from this research reveal that the feed rate plays a paramount role in influencing both Ra and Rz. Furthermore, it 
is noteworthy that the interplay between two factors, namely the feed rate and cutting speed, as well as the depth 
of cut and cutting speed, exerts notable effects.

1. Introduction
A variety of difficult issues have evolved in modern manufacturing methods, notably with regard to the wear 
characteristics and performance of lathe tool inserts. Achieving superior surface quality is a critical objective 
within manufacturing industries as it significantly impacts the performance and functionality of mechanical 
components. Surface roughness, a crucial indicator of machined surface quality, holds relevance in engineering 
applications. Among the variety of materials employed in manufacturing, hardened steel is a popular choice due 
to its outstanding mechanical properties, durability, and widespread use across industries. Hence, the quest for 
optimizing surface roughness in the machining of hardened steel poses a significant challenge. This research holds 
particular importance due to the imperative to advance machining technology, especially when dealing with hard 
materials. As industries increasingly require components with elevated precision and superior surface 
characteristics, machining processes must adapt and improve accordingly. 
 The motivation for this study lies in the aspiration to enhance the surface quality of hardened steel components 
through the utilization of the Taguchi method in dry turning operations. The driving force behind this investigation 
stems from the pressing need to enhance machining methods, especially when dealing with demanding materials. 
The scientific community acknowledges that attaining the ideal surface roughness is a multifaceted task 
demanding meticulous examination and inventive methodologies. This research is driven by the prospect of 
offering a methodical and dependable strategy for improving the surface characteristics of hardened steel 
components. Employing Taguchi Design Optimization as a tool, this investigation aspires to furnish

5. Conclusion 
The dry-turning experiments were done on a CNC lathe for hardened steel using the Taguchi Method. The 
intention of this study, 'Taguchi Design Optimization for Improved Surface Roughness in Dry Turning of 
Hardened Steel,' was to address a significant issue in modern manufacturing practices: obtaining superior surface 
quality, particularly when machining components made of hardened steel. The experiments revealed that the most 
favorable combination of cutting parameters, which resulted in a minimum surface roughness of 2.6 µm, 
corresponded to a cutting speed (V) of 120 m/min, a feed rate (F) of 0.2 mm/rev, and a depth of cut (D) of 0.08 
mm, yielding an S/N ratio of -8.29947. The research's goals included improving surface quality and increasing 
operational effectiveness while adhering to sustainability and financial viability standards. This study sought to 
provide systematic and trustworthy techniques for manufacturers and engineers to efficiently optimize machining 
parameters, tool selection, and process conditions by utilizing Taguchi Design Optimization. In this research, tried 
to find the best cutting parameters and rigorously tested and validated them using experimental design principles, 
but there are some limitations to machining operations. That’s why analyzed a very small amount of data. If more 
data could be analyzed, then the result would be better.

Abstract 
The critical role of road infrastructure in shaping a nation's economic landscape is widely acknowledged. The global 
pursuit of sustainable and cost-effective road infrastructure has led to the adoption of Prestressed Precast Concrete 
technology. Specifically, Prestressed Precast Concrete Pavement (PPCP) has emerged as a transformative approach, 
involving the production of precast pavement panels at dedicated construction yards, followed by their transportation 
to the project site and subsequent tensioning. Welded Wire Reinforcement (WWR), a prefabricated high-strength 
welded wire arranged in rectangular grids, plays a pivotal role in this innovation. PPCP implemented along with WWR 
not only expedites construction but also elevates the quality and durability of pavements. In this paper, a method is 
introduced for the construction of an economically viable and sustainable pavement system using PPCP with WWR. 
This pioneering approach elucidates its benefits and presents a detailed cost-benefit analysis. This paper aims to shed 
light on a pragmatic and forward-looking solution for road infrastructure, aligning with the essentials of sustainability, 
economic viability, and quality.

1. Introduction
The development of a nation's road network holds significant importance in fostering socio-economic growth. In the 
context of Bangladesh, similar to numerous developing nations, road infrastructure plays a crucial role as a lifeline, 
connecting various regions, facilitating trade and commerce, and improving the overall quality of life for its citizens. 
The escalating demand for enhanced road transport infrastructure in Bangladesh are stimulated by the country's 
expanding economy and rapidly growing population.

Lastly, the synergistic blend of prestressed precast pavements (PPCP) with Welded Wire Reinforcement (WWR) 
further optimizes the pavement construction. WWR introduces notable efficiency gains by reducing construction time 
and cost. Where, Ahmed et al. (2023) found that for a two way slab construction with 8mm WWR reduces 28% 
construction time and 33.3% of labor cost. Additionally, it offers enhanced control over crack formation, which could 
mitigate potential deterioration of the pavement system. This holistic approach, encompassing precast technology, 
prestressing, and WWR, presents a comprehensive strategy to address the complex challenges and demands of modern 
road construction. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the core objective of this study was to identify and recommend a pavement type that is not only cost-
effective but also sustainable, especially in the challenging context of tropical weather and adverse traffic conditions 
which are often experienced in developing countries such as Bangladesh. The adoption of Prestressed Precast Concrete 
Pavement (PPCP) with Welded Wire Reinforcement (WWR) emerges as a promising solution, driven by its 
remarkable potential to expedite construction, reduce life cycle costs, and enhance overall pavement performance. 
The findings of this study, project a future where PPCP with WWR could become a prominent and widely embraced 
method in the pavement construction industry, particularly for achieving sustainability. This innovative approach 
represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of more resilient and economical road infrastructure, aligning with 
the evolving needs and challenges of developing nations. It underscores the importance of research and development 
in shaping the future of construction practices to meet the demands of both the present and future.

Abstract 
This research focuses on plastic sacks produced by a plastic recycling company. The company is a manufacturing 
company in the recycling industry that produces plastic seeds and plastic sacks. This research identifies defects or 
shortcomings in the plastic sack production process. The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the causes of 
product defects during the production process. Furthermore, improvement proposals will be given to reduce product 
defects in the production process. The method that will be used in this research is the Six Sigma method using DMAIC 
tools (define, measure, analyze, improve, control). The average production produces 20,404 kg of plastic sacks in 6 
months, with a defect rate of 3.12% of total production. Defects in the production process include defects in raw 
materials and loose stitches. Based on the calculation of Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO), the sigma level 
was found to be 3.59. An RPN value of 252 was also obtained for the detached stitch defect from the FMEA analysis. 
The cause of the production defect is the shifting of the bag weaving machine from its weaving groove. This research 
is expected to provide benefits by reducing the number of defects that occur during the production process in the 
company.

1. Introduction
The rapid development of science and technology today, it makes us more open to change because of the progress and 
development in the industrial world. In this industry 4.0, the Company is increasingly advanced and there are also 
operations in the industrial sector itself that are more practical and simple. This practicality is supported by the use of 
sophisticated machines that will produce products with good quality. To get quality product results, it is necessary to 
have quality control which aims to keep the product of good quality and quality to increase consumer attractiveness 
to choose these products. Quality is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various attributes and characteristics of 
a product or service (Kostas 2020). The level of quality of the products produced including some of these 
characteristics must be maintained within a certain limit. Therefore, to maintain the quality of products produced 
within a certain limit, it is necessary to control quality based on the 4M factor (machine, material, man, method). The 
company in the study is one of the companies engaged in recycling plastic waste and trading plastic waste. This 
company carries out production by recycling sack waste taken from collectors. In the production of the sacks 
themselves, several work processes will be carried out such as extruder, knitting, cutting, sewing yarn, and finish 
good. Quality Control carried out during the sack-making process is an inspection of the knitting process which will 
record the amount of production, and the number of defective products produced every day to be reported to the 
production manager. Sack production itself is the most produced production, therefore the focus of this thesis 
discussion is defects in raw materials used in the production process, and also product defects produced during the 
sack production process. The following is data on the sack production process which has defects can be seen in table

Based on the RPN calculation to determine the highest priority is the detachable stitch defect with an RPN value of 
252.   
 
4.5 Improve  
The improvement stage is the fourth stage in the Six Sigma method. This stage contains proposals for improvements 
that must be made by the company to increase productivity and reduce defects in products during the production 
process. The following are proposed improvements based on the analysis of the causes of failure: 
1. The first suggested improvement is the creation of a standard operating procedure for sorting used sacks that 
will be used so that workers can know the standard of used sacks that can be used for the plastic seed 
production process. 
2. The second suggestion given is to standardize the color of plastic seeds that are suitable for making plastic 
sacks. The purpose of this standardization is to avoid product defects. 
3. The third suggestion is the making of a Chechsheet on a knitting machine which aims to get information 
about the feasibility of the products produced whether by company standards or not.

Abstract 
Quality control of a product within a company is a demand to fulfill and achieve product quality by existing standards. 
With quality control, a problem or defect in the product produced can be seen. Research was conducted in a company 
that operates in the electricity sector by producing products in the form of ceramic insulators.  The problem in this 
company is that there are still many defects caused by several factors such as human error, environment, and also the 
methods used. There are 4 types of defects produced, namely broken neck of the product, the broken body of the 
product, broken leg of the product, and porous defects. This research purpose is to find out the causes of defects from 
any defects that occurred, then find out solutions or corrective actions to provide on which priority failures need to be 
reduced. The research was carried out using the Six Sigma method with the DMAIC stages, followed by an FMEA 
assessment table. After data processing, the capability process (Cp) value was 0.7467, and the Cpk was 0.6477. Then, 
we obtained a DPMO value is 13,250, so the Sigma level obtained for the last 6 months was 3.72. Then, using FMEA 
method, we obtained the biggest RPN score is broken body of the product with score 140. So, the improvement 
suggestion is to check and replace lamps used at glazing stations.

1. Introduction
Industrial development is known to grow over time, with the times following the developments, companies have to 
improve their quality. The activities of a company in the industrial sector must pay attention to product quality. The 
production process is carried out by a company that wants to produce finished goods that comply with predetermined 
standards. The company is expected to be able to maintain and improve the quality of its products (Gremyr et al. 2021). 
Many large companies have used machines and equipment with sophisticated technology to meet the desired 
production targets. Even though many companies use machines with advanced technology, quality control to maintain 
product quality is still needed so that products have competitiveness (Gupta et al. 2021). 
One step to maintain product quality is to analyze product defects, and key product quality and carry out improvement 
activities (Psarommatis 2022). Companies must have their standards for products produced through a quality control 
process, so if there are errors, the company will more easily respond to problems with existing standards. (Mrugalska 
and Tytyk 2015). The production process in terms of production flow is divided into 2, namely continuous process 
and intermittent process. A continuous process is a production process that occurs continuously or continuously, where 
the production process has a pattern or sequence so that it will always be the same from time to time. Meanwhile, an 
intermittent process is a production process that occurs intermittently, where the production process has several 
patterns or sequences and is always changing (Wang et al. 2021). 
The research was conducted at a company that operates in the manufacturing sector with production results in the 
form of electrical equipment, namely ceramic insulators. The production process at the company includes the grinding 
process, filter process, drying, forming, glazing, firing and assembling. During the production process, this company 
discovered a defect in the product produced. Based on the results of interviews and field observations, there are 
problems in controlling the quality of ceramic insulators, causing defects in the product. This research aims to identify

6. Conclusion 
In this research, it was discovered that there were 4 types of defects produced, namely broken defects on the neck 
of the product, broken defects on the body of the product, broken defects on the legs of the product, and porous 
defects. From the calculations and failure analysis that have been carried out, the defect in the product body has 
an RPN value of 140 so suggestions are obtained as a priority for repair, namely checking and replacing the lamps 
used at the glazing station. For problems that occur, suggestions for improvements are given, such as making a 
check sheet to help operators carry out their duties, and then making a Poka Yoke as a guide for workers to 
distinguish between incorrect and correct work results. Then, based on data calculations after implementation, it 
is known that the related data leads to better value for the company. The increase that occurred was not very 
significant due to limited research time. In 21 days, the Cp value increased from 0.7421 to 0.7693 and the Cpk 
value increased from 0.6423 to 0.6778. Then the DPMO value from 13,290 decreased to 10,690, which means the 
defects produced were reduced, and there was an increase in the Sigma value to a higher level, namely from 3.72 
to 3.8. So, it can be concluded that company defects are reduced by implementing the Six Sigma method.

Abstract 
Maintenance is an important thing to do in a company to support the running of the production process. The research 
was conducted at a company operating in the electrical industry. This company is a manufacturing company that 
produces ceramic insulators. Based on the results of research that has been carried out, there are problems with 
downtime. To increase the productivity of machine performance, it is necessary to measure machine performance, 
namely by using the Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) concept. In using the Total Productive Maintenance 
concept, the Overall Equipment Effectiveness value and Six Big Losses analysis are calculated. The aim of this 
research is to determine the level of machine effectiveness and the causes of ineffective machine performance in the 
production process. Once the level of engine performance and its causes are known, suggestions for improvements 
can be made to improve the level of effectiveness of engine performance. Based on the analysis that has been carried 
out, the machine that has the largest downtime is the extruder machine. Based on the results of the calculations that 
have been carried out, the average OEE value is 51.970%, with the largest factor being the performance efficiency 
value of 61.489% and the largest six big losses value being reduced speed losses of 33.421%. 
Keywords 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness, Maintenance, Six Big Losses and Total Productive Maintenance. 
Introduction 
The manufacturing industry is a field that is developing very rapidly, especially in Indonesia. Various manufacturing 
companies compete with each other to be the best. Manufacturing companies must also have advantages compared to 
their competitors to increase customer satisfaction which has a positive impact on the company. To support optimal 
production processes, routine maintenance and repairs are very necessary to maximize the production process. When 
the machines used by the company run well and damage rarely occurs, then of course the production target will be 
achieved and the company will not experience losses (Vital and Lima 2020). 
Maintenance or what is usually called upkeep is an important aspect that must be paid attention to and carried out as 
the production process progresses. Small errors resulting from maintenance negligence can develop into a big problem 
and can result in losses if the company does not pay attention to maintenance (Shaker et al. 2022). This company is a 
manufacturing company that produces ceramic insulators that has been around since 1971. This company has various 
types of different machines at each work station. To determine machine performance, downtime is needed for 
calculations. In the company, there are 3 machines that have the largest downtime, namely the filter press, extruder 
and wad mill. The selection of data used to determine machine performance refers to downtime and is taken from the 
largest amount of time, namely on the extruder machine. 
At this company, machine performance measurements have not yet been implemented against its production targets. 
One way to overcome this is by implementing Total Productive Maintenance or TPM, which is a maintenance system 
that aims to maximize machine performance so that it becomes more effective and efficient. The Overall Equipment 
Effectiveness OEE method is to determine machine performance and also the Six Big Losses method to find the main 
factors of 6 problems that make machine work not optimal.

4.7 Autonomous Maintenance Improvements 
Autonomous maintenance is a machine maintenance concept that involves machine operators as users to carry out 
basic maintenance. The implementation of autonomous maintenance aims to directly involve the machine operator as 
the person responsible for machine maintenance, which in turn is expected to increase productivity and reduce 
downtime (Workineh and Iyengar 2014). To date, this company has implemented preventive maintenance and 
corrective maintenance. Preventive maintenance is machine maintenance that is scheduled within a fixed period. 
Meanwhile, corrective maintenance is machine maintenance carried out after the machine is damaged (Hung et al. 
2017). The procedure carried out by this company for carrying out maintenance on machines is still relatively 
unstructured and existing machine maintenance procedures are still unclear. Proposed improvements regarding the 
problems found in this company focus on the TPM autonomous maintenance pillar. The suggestions that will be given 
are SOP for autonomous maintenance, Gantt chart, maintenance implementation schedule, and work orders. 
 
The scope of maintenance carried out by operators is carrying out light maintenance and repairs such as cleaning 
machines, inspections, lubrication, machine monitoring, and other things related to production machines. The SOP in 
this proposed improvement aims to maximize the effectiveness of maintenance activities and prevent fatal damage 
that causes losses for the company, as well as reduce downtime. 
 
The Gantt chart on the proposed improvements provided aims to plan machine care and maintenance activities and 
also monitor maintenance activities that have been carried out. By using a Gantt chart, operators who are monitoring 
maintenance activities will immediately fill in information related to the machine being repaired, starting from the 
timeline, the name of the machine being repaired, to the time needed to repair the machine. 
 
The final improvement proposal is to create work orders for machine maintenance activities. Work orders are useful 
for making it easier to record handling of problems on machines which can be filled in manually by staff or operators 
in the field. This work order is a sign that the machine is damaged and must be repaired immediately or just carry out 
light maintenance to prevent fatal damage which can increase downtime. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the analysis that has been carried out, the average OEE value from September 2022 to August 2023 is 
51.97%, which means that this value is still at world-class standards and indicates that maintenance activities are not 
yet optimal. In calculating the six big losses, the highest value was obtained for reducing speed losses with a value of 
33.421%. Several factors cause low OEE values, especially on extruder machines. Some of the machine work is 
hampered, the machine stops suddenly, and the output speed of the machine is reduced. By providing proposals for 
improvements with autonomous maintenance, it is hoped that the effectiveness of the machine will increase, thereby 
triggering production performance to meet production targets.

1. Introduction
Home means house, residence, or hometown. Meanwhile, the industry can be interpreted as crafts, goods product 
businesses, and/or companies. The home industry is a product house or small company. In general, the definition of 
SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) usually includes at least two aspects, namely the initial investment value 
aspect, the number of assets, and the number of personnel aspects. According to BPS, the number of workers 
includes the home industry with a workforce of 5-9 people, the small industry with a workforce of 10-19 people, 
medium industry with a workforce of 20-99 people, large industry with a workforce of 100 people or more. (Jakfat 
and Dian 2020). 
This convection is a home industry that operates in the field of carpet and heat-resistant product manufacturing, 
founded in 2005 and located in Cikini, Central Jakarta. In the production process, a sewing machine is used, 
which is done with human assistance to control the operation of the machine. The process of making heat-
retaining products begins by inserting tissue material and polyester knitting thread, then entering the weaving 
machine process which produces rope, after the tissue material and the polyester knitting yarn have become rope. 
The next process is to enter the production machine which will produce heat-retaining products. 
The research was carried out in a home industry that operates in the manufacturing sector with the production of 
heat-retaining products. The production process for heat-resistant products includes forming and sewing processes. 
In the production process, a defect was found in the product produced. Based on the results of interviews and field 
observations, there are problems in controlling the quality of heat-retaining products, causing defects in the products. 
This research aims to identify and provide suggestions for improvements to reduce product defects in the production 
process. To reduce existing defects, the author will use the FMEA and FTA methods which aim to determine the 
causes of product defects and to reduce defects in the production process.

defects in the product, namely in the needle sector and in the sewing machine sector. Proposed improvements were 
given, namely replacing needles from previously once a month to twice a month, and making a regular machine 
maintenance schedule to reduce the occurrence of product defects due to less than optimal production machine 
performance, adding ventilation or fans to the room. production so that air circulation can circulate, and adding 
lighting to the production section to minimize the occurrence of product defects. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results and discussion in this research, researchers can conclude several research results, namely: 
1. Factors that cause product defects are caused by human factors, the machines used, and the tools used. 
Identification is carried out by analyzing the production process, type of failure, potential consequences of 
failure, and causes of failure. 
2. The results of calculations using the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) method for heat retaining 
products obtained the highest RPN value from the product of the severity value, occurrence value and 
detection value. The highest RPN value is found in the unstitched rope defect type with an RPN value of 
192 and the lowest value is found in the sloppy stitching defect type with parallel RPN values of 168 and 
147. 
3. Based on analysis using the FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) method, defects in non-stitched ropes are caused by 
bent or blunt needles. Apart from that, this is caused by the inappropriate size or type of needle and operators 
being in a hurry during the production process due to chasing production times and targets.

Abstract 
The eyes are referred to as the ""windows of the soul,"" which emphasizes their significance. The eye is a critical element 
of the human body that allows a person to see and understand his environment. Blindness makes it difficult for a person 
to perform daily tasks. Technological advancements facilitate communication between visually impaired individuals and 
their environment. In this paper, we introduced an application called SMART-SHOE, which serves as a helping hand for 
the visually impaired, using innovative solutions to reduce their challenges. The user is required to wear the shoes during 
the procedure. When sensors detect an obstruction, the user will be notified via the Android system they are using. The 
proposed device can detect significant obstacles in a very short duration of time. It takes around 3.08 minutes on average 
and detects about 89.5% of obstacles.

1. Introduction
People with disabilities such as blindness, low vision, visual impairment, and vision loss encounter substantial obstacles 
that impact their physical, mental, social, and economic well-being. These challenges decrease their quality of life and 
hinder their ability to engage in essential daily activities, with navigation and mobility being particularly crucial. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) released its inaugural global report on vision on October 8, 2019, revealing that 
approximately 2.2 billion individuals worldwide experience vision impairments. The majority of these individuals could 
attain normal vision through the use of eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. A significant proportion, 
approximately 85%, of visually impaired people reside in low- and middle-income nations. Age-related cataract is the 
primary cause of blindness, accounting for 79% of all cases. Cataract surgery and the correction of refractive errors are 
considered highly cost-effective healthcare interventions. During a discussion, it was highlighted by experts that 
approximately 750,000 individuals in Bangladesh are currently experiencing blindness. Dr. Golam Mostafa, the Director 
of the National Eye Care Line and the National Institute of Ophthalmology and Hospital (NIOH), emphasized in his 
presentation that around 1.5 million children in Bangladesh are affected by low vision, a condition that can be prevented 
with appropriate intervention. 
Many blind people rely on travel aids to get around in unfamiliar places. We demonstrate the Smart-shoes project, which 
allows visually impaired people with mobility issues to avoid obstacles. Our system identifies obstacles such as curbs, 
stairwells in the ground, and even moving objects using existing robotics technology, and sends obstacle information 
via haptic feedback (vibrations and beeps). Our system enables human users to travel safely in both indoor and outdoor 
areas, according to preliminary tests. 
Numerous aids have been created to assist individuals with visual impairments in navigating with ease. Various 
organizations have devoted considerable efforts over an extended period to produce affordable and efficiently structured 
devices for this purpose. The combined use of several types of sensors, notably the active-passive combination, can 
provide a lot of value to a full and reliable obstacle detection sensing system. A technique based on the major challenge

Figure 7, a visual representation of the device's accuracy, provides a striking visual testament to its efficacy. The graph 
clearly illustrates a significantly high rate of obstacle detection, reinforcing the Smart-shoe's value as a dependable aid 
for users in various situations, whether navigating familiar paths or bustling, dynamic environments.

After evaluating the outcomes of various methods explored in this study, this paper introduces a system of intelligent 
footwear designed to aid visually impaired individuals in detecting obstacles and navigating their surroundings. These 
smart shoes are constructed using Arduino, an embedded device. By utilizing the GPS module, the Smart shoe system 
will be able to direct the user to an obstacle-free route to their desired destination in the future. The suggested system 
will operate automatically, taking into account real-time pathways and obstacles encountered during the journey. The 
obstacles will be handled through the algorithm pre-programmed within Arduino, initiating communication via the 
Android interface. The sensors will detect the obstacle and output values, allowing the obstacle's distance from the 
sensors to be calculated. Arduino will simplify the data processing and transmit it to the smartphone via an interface 
device that relies on the information obtained from the sensors. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research offers a potential solution to address the mobility challenges encountered by individuals with visual 
impairments in Bangladesh. Using a text-to-speech technique, the user can audibly perceive distances from their current 
location, which can be especially beneficial when an online connection is not available, enhancing usability. The 
integration of an API enables the background operation of a Google Maps application to aid in navigation by detecting 
obstacles. However, it's worth noting that the device has certain limitations, such as occasional difficulty in detecting 
small objects with limited surface area, like gravel, wires, or small bricks. 
 
While these Smart-shoes facilitate a visually impaired individual's experience by providing enhanced perception, 
hearing, and mobility, they are not without their constraints. To enhance detection capabilities, it is proposed that the 
number of sensors within the shoes be increased and distributed throughout the design. This, however, comes with the 
trade-off of increased shoe weight. Therefore, further research is warranted to develop an optimal solution that balances

Abstract 
The research was conducted at a manufacturing company that produces polyethylene (PE) plastic pellets. This 
company recycles unused plastic so that it has more benefits, namely as a raw material for the plastic industry. This 
research aims to be able to assist companies in increasing effectiveness and efficiency using the Sustainable Value 
Stream Mapping method. The application of this method begins by first identifying several indicators related to the 
triple bottom line, which include economic, environmental, and social aspects. To find out which indicators need 
improvement, it is necessary to calculate the efficiency of each indicator. After the calculation was carried out, five 
indicators were obtained that needed improvement, namely waste (environmental aspect) with an efficiency of 
32.13%, noise level (environmental aspect) with an average value of 85.57 dB, lighting level (environmental aspect) 
with a value of 75 Lux, room temperature (environmental aspect) with a temperature of 33.8 °C, and employee safety 
level (social aspect) with 50.00% efficiency. To be able to assist companies in improving the efficiency of these three 
indicators, the next stage that will be carried out is to provide some suggestions for improvements related to waste by 
recycling again, noise levels using earplugs, lighting levels by adding or replacing lamps with brighter light, room 
temperature by adding ventilation and hexos, and employee safety by conducting counseling on the importance of 
security and safety at work.

1. Introduction
Plastic waste is still one of the problems that is quite concerning in Indonesia today. According to the National Waste 
Management Information System (SIPSN) until 2022, plastic waste is ranked 4th based on the type of waste in 
Indonesia, which is 17.82% (Ministry of Environment and Forestry 2023). Plastic itself consists of various types, one 
of which is polyethylene (PE). Polyethylene (PE) plastic itself is a type of plastic polymer made from ethylene 
compounds. This type of plastic has good resistance to water and chemicals and is strong, elastic, and recyclable 
(Xiuhua et al. 2015). However, this type of plastic takes a long time to decompose naturally, so if it is used excessively, 
it will affect the environment (Ali et al. 2020). 
This research was conducted on manufacturing companies that produce products in the form of plastic pellets. After 
conducting an interview process with one of the persons in charge of the company and direct observation at the 
production site, there were several problems related to defective products, hot and smoky work environments, and 
waste in melted plastic dough that came out of the machine due to leaks in the machine. In addition, there is waste in 
the form of sand washed from plastic as raw material in making plastic pellets, where the waste requires more costs 
for the disposal of the waste. In addition, there is an uncomfortable work environment that can affect the health and 
safety of the workers themselves. And also, after conducting a direct survey at the production site, it was found that 
workers did not use personal protective equipment, which could increase the risk of accidents at work.

Figure 5. Earplugs and Earmuff 
 
According to Farhad et al., using earplugs and earmuffs can reduce noice by up to 18 dB. So, using this tool can protect 
workers' ears so as to reduce the risk that can arise due to noice. For lighting level indicators, companies can change 
the lamps used to be brighter so that the lighting level can be in accordance with predetermined standards. For room 
temperature indicators, this can be done by increasing the number of exhaust fan on the roofs of the production area 
and adding ventilation around the production area. And for indicators of the level of work safety, the company can 
conduct counseling on the importance of security and safety at work and facilitate personal protective equipment such 
as gloves, boots, and long-sleeved clothes to minimize exposure to the plastic melt dough, which can be seen in Figure 
6. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Personal Protective Equipment 
 
6. Conclusion 
After carrying out efficiency measurements and calculations for eleven indicators, it was found that five assessment 
indicators fell into the critical category, namely waste, noise level, lighting level, room temperature, and employee 
safety level. For the first indicator, namely waste, with an efficiency rate of 32.13%, this indicator includes the 
environmental aspect. Furthermore, there is a mean noise level indicator with a noise level of 85.57 dB. For the lighting 
level indicator, namely with a lighting level of 75 Lux, the value is still below the predetermined standard of 100 Lux 
for room temperature indicators after measurements are taken for a temperature of 33.8°C. This value also exceeds 
the temperature standard set by government regulations. And for work safety indicators, they have a low efficiency 
rate of 50.00%. These results are depicted through the Sustainable Value Stream Mapping chart using traffic lights, 
which can be seen in Figure 1. Therefore, improvements were made to these five indicators, namely using waste as a 
planting medium, using earplugs and earmuffs to reduce noise, replacing lamps with higher lighting levels, adding 
several ventilation and exhaust fans, and using Personal Protection Equipment in production areas. and provide 
warnings and sanctions for employees who do not comply with regulations. This improvement suggestion aims to 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the production process at the PE-type plastic pellet company.

Abstract 
In order to make a manufacturing system sustainable, it is crucial to integrate sustainability practices across the whole 
supply chain and the production process. It is a demand in today's industrial sector, especially in developing nations 
like Bangladesh which has an emerging economy. The most important economic, environmental, and social 
assessment criteria for choosing sustainable suppliers will be identified through a thorough literature analysis and 
expert input. The Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method will be used to determine the 
weights of the selected evaluation criteria. The ultimate ranking of suppliers in the Agro-food industry will then be 
determined using the Fuzzy Topsis approach utilizing the criterion weight from the SWARA method. This study is 
anticipated to help decision-makers in the Agro-food sectors of developing nations choose suppliers who are both 
long-term economically and ecologically sustainable.

1. Introduction
The Agro-food processing sector is a significant industry, especially for the countries which has an emerging economy 
like Bangladesh. This industry is a significant component of Bangladesh's manufacturing sector, which today 
contributes around 20% of the nation's GDP and the industry is growing day by day. Due to increasing environmental 
and economic worries, sustainability has been a top issue for enterprises globally since the United Nations (UN) 
announced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in 2015. The Bangladeshi government has chosen the Agro-
food sector as one of its priority sectors for sustainable development. For organizations to operate effectively and 
produce high-quality products, supplier selection is a crucial process. In Bangladesh, the growth of the Agro-
processing industry is severely constrained. There are some critical problems with the availability of the market, huge 
transportation costs, inadequate post-harvesting procedures knowledge, and packaging to Bangladesh's Agro-
processing industry's expansion. It is crucial to create a sustainable supplier selection framework to address these 
issues. The research's innovation is the creation of a hybrid model in SSS that can simulate the decision-making 
process, take into account a wide range of factors, and produce more precise findings. This will help managers identify 
potential areas for development and boost competitive advantage, ensuring that the most sustainable provider is chosen 
from a pool of suppliers. Additionally, this will help to improve the effectiveness of the supply chain.

4. Result 
With the help of this thesis, we intend to identify a suitable supplier for the Argo-food sector based on their various 
requirements. How to choose a sustainable supplier is something we learn. Decision-makers may learn from this study 
how important various economic, geographical, and social factors are in relation to one another. Rank of the criteria

5. Conclusion and Discussion 
Sustainable Supplier Selection is presented as one of the sustainable practices that affect all operational operations 
inside a corporation in the context of sustainable supply chain management. It might be difficult to choose the best 
supplier(s) who can obtain materials or components while taking organizational requirements and predefined 
sustainable standards into account. Therefore, providing Decision makers with precise decision-making support would 
be advantageous for an effective organizational movement towards putting sustainable sourcing practices in place. 
This study looked at the SSS issue in the Argo-food industry with the hope of offering a useful method for SSS 
decision-making. The relationships between and the criteria and sub-criteria were not taken into account, which is a 
weakness of this study. The outcomes may be affected by taking into account the dependencies between the criterion 
and sub-criteria. Further research might use the Analytic Network Process to evaluate the relationships between the 
criterion and sub-criteria (ANP).

Abstract 
This research is focused on collared and T-shirt products in the garment industry with various types of clothing, 
especially for the upper middle market segment. High-quality products that meet consumer needs are highly 
expected in today's competitive era. The results of observations of the products in this company found that there 
were many defects. Types of defects include dirty defects, holed, cut, and oblique defects. The method used to 
reduce defects is the Six Sigma method with fishbone diagram analysis, why-why analysis, and FMEA to improve 
product quality with the research objective of identifying the largest types of defects that occur in the production 
process, identifying factors that influence the biggest defects in the production process, providing suggestions for 
improvements using the application of six sigma with the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) 
stages which aims to reduce defects in the production process. The DPMO value obtained was 13619.5 for collared 
shirts and 15376.3 for T-shirts with a sigma level value of 3.71 for collared shirts and 3.66 for T-shirts, which is 
still far from what was expected. Suggestions for improving quality are making Check sheets, providing training 
to operators, scheduling machine maintenance, and replacing equipment with more appropriate equipment.

1. Introduction
The high volume of production demand often causes a company to ignore the quality of its products. With 
increasingly tight competition and high consumer demand, business actors must think more about and improve 
the quality of their products, starting from the initial manufacturing process until the goods are in the hands of 
consumers. The company is engaged in the garment industry with a variety of clothing models, especially for the 
upper middle market segment facilitated by automatic factory machines and supported by well-known textile 
suppliers with superior quality fabric quality. This company produces clothes for well-known brands. By 
collaborating with large companies, companies must provide the best quality products that have passed and passed 
the quality control process so that the quality of the products produced is always guaranteed and customers can 
feel satisfied. 
Based on observations that have been made, in the clothing production process several types of product defects 
were found which were quite high, namely collared shirts at 5.4% of total production, and T-shirts at 4.6% of total 
production. Therefore, it is necessary to research to analyze the types of defects in the production process and the 
factors that cause these defects so that efforts can be made to reduce the number of defects during production. For 
this purpose, this research carried out an analysis of these defects with the aim of the research, namely identifying 
the largest types of defects that occur in the production process, identifying factors that influence the largest 
defects in the production process, providing suggestions for improvements that can be made to improve quality 
in the production process. The production process uses the application of Six Sigma with the DMAIC (Define, 
Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control) stages which aims to reduce defects in the production process. 
2. Literature Review
This study aims is to reduce the total of defects, and increase the quality of the product with the Six Sigma method 
which uses a fishbone diagram, why-why analysis, and failure mode and effect analysis.

Abstract 
This company is engaged in garment manufacturing, producing various types of clothing. One of the products 
produced is polo shirts with a make-to-order (MTO) production system. From the results of observations that have 
been made, it is known that there is much waste that occurs on the production line. The waste that occurs is product 
defects, transportation, and waiting waste. Based on these problems, research was conducted using lean 
manufacturing to increase production and reduce waste using Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Value Stream 
Analysis Tools (VALSAT), fishbone diagrams, and 5 Why’s is Analysis to identify the production process flow 
from start to finish. The production process is completed, and the root cause of waste is. Based on the results, the 
lead time value was 346.50 minutes on the current value stream map, NVA activity was 54.17 minutes, NNVA 
activity was 32.10 minutes, and defects were 5%. Proposed improvements to be implemented in the company to 
reduce waste are by providing suggestions for maintenance activities, warning signs, additions, and utilization of 
work facilities. Carrying out the proposed improvements that have been given can result in a reduction in the total 
lead time of 13.78 minutes, an increase in process cycle efficiency of 1.65%, and a reduction in the defect rate of 
1% from a value of 5% to 4% based on the results of future value stream mapping.

1. Introduction
A company operating in the garment industry located in North Jakarta. The products produced are t-shirts and 
polo shirts, with the company's production system being make-to-order (MTO). The production process begins 
with preparing the raw materials, which is then continued with the patterning process/making clothing patterns. 
Then, it cuts the fabric according to the size requested by the consumer. After cutting, the sewing process is carried 
out, followed by making holes or buttoning in the product and marking the buttons that will be attached. On the 
clothes, the inspection process is carried out to ensure that the clothes produced are of good quality. If the quality 
of the product is said to be good, then the clothes will go through the rubbing stage first before reaching the 
consumer. The product will go through the pack using a poly bag and end with cardboard packaging; the finished 
goods will be stored in the finished product storage area. 
By carrying out the production process effectively, waste will be reduced to provide added value to the product. 
In the production process, activities with no added value and waste lead to higher use of energy and human 
resources and inefficient production (Shou et al., 2020). Currently, the production process in companies can, of 
course, still be improved in terms of efficiency by reducing the possibility of defects, waiting, and inefficiencies 
when moving goods (Muhammad and Yadrifil, 2018). One use that can reduce waste on the production line is 
lean manufacturing. The principles used in the use of lean manufacturing are Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and 
Value Stream Analysis Tools (VALSAT) because they can identify the efficiency of the production process flow 
from start to finish and can increase efficiency in the production process by reducing unnecessary activities and 
by decreased lead time (Haekal J, 2022). Apart from that, the waste is identified by analyzing the root causes 
using a fishbone diagram and 5 why's analysis. Implementing lean manufacturing and waste analysis is hoped to 
reduce waste that occurs and increase process cycle efficiency (PCE) by providing suggestions that can increase 
profits for the company (Maysuda et al., 2021).

4. Utilization of work facilities in moving finished products is proposed. This waste occurs because workers 
still move manually using stairs rather than lifts. Using an elevator can reduce transportation waste in the 
garment production process. 
After the proposed improvements have been implemented, future value stream mapping is carried out to describe 
the new process flow. By creating future value stream mapping, there is an increase in process cycle efficiency.

Figure 5. Future Value Stream Mapping 
 
Based on the creation of the current value stream mapping, it is known that the total lead time was reduced by 
13.78 minutes, from 346.50 minutes to 332.72 minutes. The decline in non-value-added activity decreased by 8.9 
minutes, from 86.27 to 77.37; this increased process cycle efficiency from 75.10% to 76.75% or 1.65%. It is also 
estimated that there will be a decrease in the defect rate in the production process by 1%, from 5% to 4%. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results that have been carried out, it can be concluded that: 
1. The three highest wastes occur in the production line based on the weighting results that have been carried 
out, namely waste defects, transportation, and waiting. 
2. Five main causal factors were found in the production process, including man, machine, material, method, 
and environment. Waste defects occur due to workers' lack of concentration, dirty machines that frequently 
jam, fabric being cut, poor needle quality, and a noisy work environment. Waste transportation due to 
moving goods in large quantities still uses trolleys; congested areas create traffic because goods are often 
moved using human hands, which can hinder traffic movement, and the distance of moving goods is quite 
far. Waiting occurs due to unskilled workers waiting in turns to use trolleys, setting up the machine for 
quite a long time, the finished goods transfer area being congested due to piles of finished goods in the 
finished goods moving area, the product inspection process taking quite a long time due to waiting for the 
results fabric cutting. 
3. The proposed improvement given by the company to increase the value of the process cycle efficiency is 
maintenance activities, such as making a machine maintenance/checking/repair card, which will be given 
to the company. Warning signs include warning signs on sewing tables and warning signs on rubbing tables. 
Additional work facilities, such as additional thread clip scissors and earplugs. Utilization of work facilities, 
such as elevator facilities, in the company. The proposed improvements can result in a reduction in the 
total lead time of 13.78 minutes and an increase in process cycle efficiency of 1.65% based on future value 
stream mapping results. 
 
7. Suggestion 
In the field of garment production, it is hoped that future research will carry out comprehensive analyses to dig 
deeper into the ins and outs of waste in the production process. The emphasis is expected to go beyond current 
exploration and include careful investigation of various types of waste. The focus will primarily be on identifying 
and mitigating other forms of waste, including but not limited to excess inventory, overproduction, over-
processing, and unnecessary movement or motion. By expanding their investigations to cover a broader spectrum 
of waste elements, this research aims to contribute to ongoing efforts in the industry to optimize production 
processes and improve overall efficiency.

Abstract 
The electronic factories have problems from the inefficiency of producing and delivering products as PER customer's 
order. This is because customer orders ended up being more than forecast in some periods and the factory did not have 
enough raw materials to produce customer demands. In duration of time, Customers have suddenly increased the 
volume of products. If the factory does not have enough materials and additional raw materials, orders will have a 
lead time of more than the date specified by the customer to deliver the product. If the manufacturer is unable to 
produce the product according to the Lead Time and Cost agreement with the customer, this will then affect customer 
confidence and satisfaction. This would cause customers to move their demand to another manufacturer then affect 
the opportunity cost. From the past about two years of data (2021-2023), It found that orders ended up being more 
than customer demands by about 51%. This study aims to reduce the problem of material shortage and opportunity 
cost by selecting the most impact model and doing regression by the Minitab program. The curve fitting regression 
was used to forecast the demand that was close to the linear line of difference customer orders. The accuracy of the 
forecast can be decreased to 31% It will use the curve fitting regression for forecast and prepare the material in the 
future and to avoid opportunity cost.

1. Introduction
Currently, the electronic assembly manufacturing industry is crucial to Thailand's economy, and equally important as 
other industries and businesses. Currently, the electronic manufacturing industry has experienced growth in both 
domestic and international. Therefore, causing very high competition in the economy. Especially the electronic parts 
assembly business for export. It has very high fluctuations in product demand. Therefore, there is a problem of shortage 
of raw materials in the production of products. The behavior of customer orders is uncertain. In case the customer 
orders products less than demanded. The manufacturer can keep the components or use them in other products and 
keep the inventory in customer consignment stock to produce products in the future. But if the customer orders more 
products than the forecast demanded. It will have problems with the manufacturer. For example, it affects to shortage 
of raw materials that will be used to produce products. As a result, the company has to purchase raw materials at a 
price that is higher than what was agreed upon with the customer to reduce the lead time for raw materials, Losing the 
opportunity to produce products. Customers may move orders to competitors instead, including future orders. 
Ultimately, it affects the delayed delivery of products that do not meet customer expectations, causing customers no 
confidence in the company.  
Therefore, the forecast must be made to be as appropriate and accurate as possible. The research aims to study 
customer forecast and demand from January 2021 to 2023 and focus on ordering more than the forecast demand by 
selecting the products with affect the most. For analysis of the volume of forecast demand to be as close and 
appropriate as possible. As well as planning the storage of raw materials that will be used to produce products. These 
forecasts must be accurate in both the short and long term. Forecasting demand and planning the storage of raw 
materials are the measures and focus on not losing the opportunity to produce products. Thus, the company to see 
customer demand expectations in response to increasing volumes.  To satisfy the most demanding customers as the

6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of an experiment that compared actual order data with the original forecast, it was found that 
customers over-ordered 51% of the demand or loss amounting to about 270000-780000 USD per year. The model can 
reduce to 31% of customer forecasting demand or a total amount of 100000-170000 USD per year. Curve regression 
will be used to predict and prepare for future materials, which will help avoid opportunity costs.

Work-related musculoskeletal disorders in industrial workers are the leading cause of morbidity in employees 
leading to detrimental influence on the company's overall productivity and profit. Long working hours in 
unsuitable posture can result in musculoskeletal disorders. If not treated these can progress to chronic illnesses in 
employees ultimately decreasing work efficiency and admonishing company output. Static and dynamic postures 
can cause severe musculoskeletal disorders and can harm permanently if immediate action is not taken. Using a 
technique called Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), it is possible to correct an employee's posture to an 
acceptable level. It also helps in reducing the severity of the problem by improving the working posture of 
employees and enhancing the productivity of the company. The posture correction process in time time-
consuming since the adaptability of the new posture differs from person to person because of their varied 
anthropometric data. Reducing the severity of musculoskeletal disorders and optimizing working hours are 
possible when an employee's posture is improved. The workers who adopt the suggested posture have a higher 
task completion rate in the prescribed time. This was because the number of complaints connected to inappropriate 
posture during working hours was significantly lower. 
RULA utilizes a photographic memory technique that allows the expert to quickly improve an employee's posture 
without the need for expensive equipment, allowing for increased productivity during working hours. The need 
for ergonomic intervention for worker safety and willingness to adapt suggested posture when needed with 
immediate effect.

Awkward posture is generating a change in behaviour because improper tool handling resulted in acute pain in 
various sections of the body. 
Early stage posture adjustment reduces muscle damage and stress caused by posture 
The RULA posture correction tool eliminated the need to purchase equipment. 
Improved posture aided the trainee in completing the assignment in the allotted time, and production increased 
several folds when he was in good posture.

Abstract 
Healthcare providers are facing increasing pressure to improve service, reduce costs, improve patient safety, reduce 
waiting times, and reduce errors and associated litigation. The United States spends 22% more than second-ranked 
Luxembourg, 49%more than third-ranked Switzerland on healthcare per capita, and 2.4 times the average of other 
OECD countries. In Ontario, healthcare will account for 50% of governmental spending by 2011, two-thirds by 2017, 
and 100% by 2026 unless a radical approach to healthcare is adopted. In China, 39% of rural and 36% of urban 
population cannot afford professional medical treatment despite the success of the country's economic and social 
reforms over the past 25 years (OECD Health Data, 2006). Clothier (2006) estimated that 50% of a clinician's time is 
not necessary and non-value added in the eyes of the patient. And as per Nino,V. et al., (2021) patient satisfaction can 
be availed by reducing the delays in registration process. By simplifying processes, lean thinking and lean principles 
can assist in removing wasteful motion, waiting, and other non-value-added tasks (Wickramasinghe, 2014).

1. Introduction:
The term ""4th Industrial Revolution"" is used to describe a significant and transformative shift in the way society, 
economies, and industries operate due to advancements in technology. It is called a ""revolution"" because it represents 
a fundamental change in how we live and work, akin to the previous industrial revolutions in history (Schwab K. 
2017). 
The term ""4th Industrial Revolution"" was introduced by Klaus Schwab, the Founder and Executive Chairman of the 
World Economic Forum, in his book ""The Fourth Industrial Revolution."" This pivotal work was published in 2016 
and has since become a cornerstone of discussions surrounding the profound changes brought about by emerging 
technologies. Schwab emphasized the disruptive and far-reaching implications of the 4th Industrial Revolution on 
industries, economies, and society. He stressed the need for governments, businesses, and individuals to adapt and 
embrace these technological shifts to harness their potential for positive change while mitigating potential risks and 
challenges (Schwab K.  2017). 
To have a brief overview of the previous industrial revolutions, the First Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th 
century with the mechanization of the textile industry and the development of steam power which marked the shift 
from agrarian economies to industrialized ones. Occurring in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, The Second 
Industrial Revolution was characterized by the widespread adoption of electricity, the internal combustion engine, and 
mass production techniques, leading to the rise of factories and mass production. The Third Industrial Revolution

Abstract 
Smart Cities embody a holistic approach to urban development, leveraging modern technologies to enhance citizens' 
quality of life, adapt infrastructure, and promote sustainable growth. Central to this concept is Smart Mobility, a vital 
response to urbanization and rising populations. This study underscores widespread acceptance of Smart City 
implementation, with Smart Mobility as a pivotal component. It highlights three key facets of Smart Mobility: 
intelligent use of ICT, smart public transport, and advanced parking technologies. Notably, surveyed cities express a 
willingness to allocate funds for this transformative vision, indicating a strong commitment to address urban 
challenges. Smart Cities have rapidly gained momentum as a holistic solution to pressing urban issues like traffic 
congestion, pollution, energy consumption, and waste management. This integrated approach amalgamates various 
urban policies into a comprehensive strategy aimed at reducing environmental footprints and improving urban 
residents' quality of life. Mobility, a complex concern with environmental and economic dimensions, emerges as a 
focal point. Smart Mobility, deeply reliant on ICT, optimizes traffic and engages citizens to enhance urban livability 
and public transport services. Smart Mobility aligns with the UN's sustainable development goals and encompasses 
traffic reduction, ecological optimization, active mobility, green fuels, and citizen participation. The integration of 
IoT, AI, Blockchain, and Big Data technologies reshapes urban paradigms, heralding a future marked by innovations 
such as Mobility-as-a-Service, traffic optimization, and autonomous vehicles. This review unveils the evolving 
landscape of Smart Mobility, emphasizing its pivotal role within the Smart City ecosystem and highlighting 
transformative opportunities and challenges in shaping the cities of tomorrow.

1. Introduction
The rapid urbanization and increasing population in Bangladesh have led to a surge in challenges related to urban 
mobility, infrastructure, and the overall quality of life in cities. In response to these challenges, smart cities have 
emerged as a transformative concept, harnessing advanced technologies to improve sustainability, enhance the quality 
of life, and optimize city services while reducing human intervention. This paradigm shift towards smart cities is 
significantly driven by the integration of information and communication technologies, digital machinery, and 
mechanical systems, all working in harmony to create a more efficient and responsive urban environment. A Smart 
City represents a comprehensive system of services implemented through modern technologies whose purpose and 
goal are to improve the quality of life for the citizens (Brčić et al. 2018). Smart cities have been evolving since their 
inception in the 1990s, with significant advancements in technology, especially the Internet of Things (IoT), playing 
a pivotal role in their development. 
Smart cities are usually developed urban areas in which a system of interrelated information, communication, 
mechanical, and digital machinery technologies is implemented to minimize human involvement with the city services 
and improve the quality of services for citizens (Tahmasseby  2022). These cities emphasize various key aspects such 
as life quality, technology, economy, sustainability, information and communication technology (ICT), and healthcare. 
They aim to meet the rising expectations of consumers, foster shared consumption practices, leverage multiple 
transportation options, and utilize emerging ICT technologies and big data analytics to create innovative, shared, and 
cost-effective solutions across various domains, including infrastructure, mobility, operations, energy, services, and 
utilities. The Smart City concept has been developed about progressing urban development and the resulting increase

Ensure accessibility for all citizens. Define KPIs and maintain a feedback loop for continuous improvement. To 
highlight transformative opportunities and challenges in shaping the cities of tomorrow. Smart City formed through 
Smart Mobility. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The integration of urban governance and technology, generally referred to as “smart cities,” is driven both by global 
private enterprise and by local and national governments seeking to strengthen economic competitiveness and improve 
quality of life (Vu & Hartley, 2018b).  Smart cities and smart mobility are the future of urban development, and in the 
context of Bangladesh, they offer immense promise for addressing the unique challenges faced by its rapidly growing 
urban centers. The proposed methodology underscores the need for comprehensive planning, stakeholder engagement, 
and data-driven decision-making to transform these areas into smart, efficient, and sustainable urban hubs. As 
Bangladesh moves forward, the implementation of smart mobility solutions will reduce congestion, improve 
accessibility, and enhance the quality of life for its citizens. The adoption of advanced parking technologies, intelligent 
use of ICT, and efficient public transportation systems will play a pivotal role in this transformation. In the future, we 
can expect further innovations in smart city technology, increased environmental sustainability, and even more 
personalized mobility solutions. By prioritizing inclusivity and accessibility, Bangladesh can pave the way for a 
brighter urban future that sets an example for sustainable development in a rapidly urbanizing world. The journey 
toward smart cities in Bangladesh is not just a vision but an imperative, and it holds the potential to shape the nation's 
urban landscape for generations to come.

Abstract 
The apparel manufacturing industry in Bangladesh experiences dynamic inefficiencies in its production system, which 
are interconnected with various unforeseen events. These inefficiencies hurt productivity, increase costs, and lead to 
increased rates of defects. This article conducts a comparative analysis between two predominant production systems, 
namely the progressive bundle system (PBS) and the unit production system (UPS). The study involved an 
examination of critical aspects such as material handling, floor space utilization, standard minute value (SMV), output, 
productivity per operator, product quality, efficiency, manpower allocation, and work-in-progress. The overall 
performance and suitability of these systems are evaluated through a quantitative analysis of primary data. To carry 
out this study, we have collected data from the operation breakdown of men's hoodie jackets, which is a critical product 
in the apparel industry. The results have indicated that the unit production system outperforms the progressive bundle 
system. We also demonstrate that the results may vary from one factory to another, as well as from style to style. 
Indeed, the results can depend on the skills and expertise of the workforce.

Abstract 
Performance measurement is a process used by companies to measure, monitor, and evaluate the work of employees 
or teams in achieving company goals with the aim of measuring employee performance standards. Performance 
measurement must be carried out to improve the performance of company employees, human resource development, 
corporate culture development, and the growth of company success. This electric and telecommunication cable 
company has a vision to become the largest electric cable manufacturer in Indonesia with a global reputation and its 
cable products have international quality and reliability. This research aims to formulate KPIs for the company and a 
performance appraisal system for the company that is beneficial to the company. Performance measurement is carried 
out using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method with 4 perspectives, namely Finance, Customers, Internal Business 
Processes, and Learning and Growth with weights of 0.480, 0.181, 0.195, 0.144 respectively. The resulting KPIs are 
12 KPIs where 4 KPIs are good, 6 KPIs that are still not optimal, and 2 KPIs that are still far below the company's 
target. These KPIs are analyzed using Objective Matrix (OMAX) with Traffic Light System.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry is one of the industries that drives the wheels of the national economy, where the economic 
growth of society is highly dependent on manufacturing companies. The manufacturing industry consists of various 
types of products, one of which is the electricity and telecommunications cable industry. The power and 
telecommunications cable industry has a crucial role in supporting electricity and communication infrastructure in 
today's modern era. With the development of technology and growing demand, cable production has become a rapidly 
growing industry. Cable manufacturers are in a highly competitive environment, where electrical and 
telecommunication cables must meet very high-quality standards to maintain the reliability of electricity and 
communication systems. Companies in this sector compete on price, quality, and innovation of their products. 
Therefore, conducting a performance assessment can help to identify areas that require special attention and maintain 
operational effectiveness to keep the company competitive in this market segment. 
This cable company was established in 1970 and began operating in 1972 with technical support from Japan and has 
a vision to become the largest electric cable manufacturer in Indonesia with a global reputation and cable products of 
international quality and reliability. The products produced are various types of cables, including telecommunication 
cables, power cables, and enameled wires. To maintain competitiveness in the industrial world, the company need to 
have a strong performance appraisal system to ensure that all goals that have been set can be sustainable in the long 
term. In a manufacturing company, it is necessary to be consistent in designing good production processes, maximizing 
sales strategies, good performance from employees, and products that satisfy customers. To ensure that all of these 
things are running well and properly, performance measurements can be used. Or now, there is no overall performance 
assessment of the company and the performance measurement that is carried out when it is still partial where the lack 
of integration of performance measurement can lead to a lack of synergy between departments within the company in

determined, getting new customers must be prioritized, the products produced can attract customer interest, the 
company has a comfortable and safe work environment, and the company provides training facilities that improve 
employee performance. 2 KPI indicators that are still not good and must be improved more, and given more attention 
by the company are the company must improve quality control capabilities and the performance of each employee 
must be improved. This can be overcome by the company providing training in the quality control section to be able 
to improve the ability of each employee who works in the QC section and to improve employee performance the 
company can ensure that employees understand the contributions made affect the company's goals and strategies. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the Balanced Scorecard and Objective Matrix, there are 12 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
that have an important influence in the cable company. In the Balanced Scorecard results, the weighted value for the 
financial perspective is 0.480, the customer perspective is 0.181, the internal business process perspective is 0.195, 
and the learning and growth perspective is 0.144. The strategic goal that has the largest value weight is maintaining 
and improving quality with a value of 0.601 and the strategic goal that has the smallest value weight is optimal 
operational cost spending with a value of 0.165. Performance measurement using Objective Matrix with Traffic Light 
System results in 4 good KPIs, 6 KPIs that are still not maximized, and 2 KPIs that are still far below the company's 
target, which requires further enhancement and increased focus from the company are the need to elevate quality 
control capabilities and enhance individual employee performance. To address this, the company should prioritize 
improving its quality control expertise through targeted training for employees in that department. Simultaneously, to 
boost overall employee performance, the company can ensure that staff comprehensively grasp the impact of their 
contributions on the company's objectives and strategies.

Abstract 
This study investigates the intricate relationships that exist between worker productivity, ergonomics environmental 
factors, workstation design, and physical discomfort. The study's primary focus was on the impact of these elements 
and how they interact in a business setting. The subject of this study was the employees of a luxury department store 
in Middle East with more or less 500 employees. PLS-SEM was employed in the study to analyze this intricate 
interaction between the components. The study includes the Rapid Office Strain Assessment (ROSA), a technique for 
evaluating the ergonomic condition of workstations. The ROSA exposure score of 4 indicates that there is room for 
significant improvement in the ergonomics of the workspace. The study also confirmed that productivity and 
workstation design are positively correlated. Furthermore, the study demonstrated a negative relationship between 
environmental ergonomic elements and physical discomfort, underscoring the importance of enhancing the workplace. 
Lastly, the study confirmed that physical discomfort reduced productivity in this type of business. This study 
emphasizes how important workplace ergonomics are to raising worker productivity and well-being. It offers 
insightful information about the connections between ergonomics, surroundings, discomfort level, and output. The 
proposals include extensive workstation enhancements, department- and demographic-specific activities, and noise-
related stress management techniques. Organizations looking to build more ergonomic and productive work 
environments should use the study's findings as a guide.

Abstract 
Queueing is a common problem for busy banks, causing long waiting times for customers. This study focuses on a 
leading bank in Bangladesh that sees high numbers of customers daily. The goal is to simulate the bank's service 
system to determine the optimal number of servers during peak hours. Additionally, removing the extra servers to get 
the optimum service level as the servers remain idle when there are not many customers in a bank is mainly for the 
cost minimization of the banking operations by maintaining its optimum utilization. Here, a discrete event simulation 
(DES) approach is utilized to build and analyze the performance of a queueing model over time. Key aspects such as 
arrival rates, service times, queue capacity, and customer tolerance are also represented. The simulation runs for an 
extended period to mimic real customer traffic and the performance metrics including average waiting time, queue 
length, resource utilization, number of busy servers, idle servers, and customer complaints are then quantified. The 
validated simulation accurately portrays the existing operation and allows testing changes by adding or removing the 
servers resulting in a reduction of 31.8% in queue length and 33.76% in service time, alongside a notable 20.48% 
improvement in service utilization. Findings suggest this simulation yields better resource management by speeding 
up service that proves effective for evaluating complex queueing systems and informing strategic decisions through 
quantitative analysis of alternatives. Overall, the analysis aimed to enhance seamless bank operations, customer 
satisfaction, and experience at the busy bank location through data-driven recommendations on queue management.

7. Conclusion 
The objective of this endeavor was to comprehend and assess the performance of a given system by comparing the 
existing system to a proposed one through simulation. To achieve that goal, the relevant theoretical background is 
presented and a simulation model was developed using the DES approach. Using AnyLogic as a platform for the 
model development, a system’s performance matrices were quantified and have been depicted in a model. This discrete 
event simulation of bank operations offers insights to improve: 
 
• 
Efficiency: The model identified bottlenecks from service utilization and quantified performance metrics of 
waiting times. Experiments optimized staff levels and service rates to increase efficiency. 
• 
Service quality: Key metrics of service level and customer cycle time were improved by over 20.48% in the 
optimized scenario. 
• 
Supply chain integration: Integrating inventory data into the model hedged risks of cash/consumables 
stockouts. 
• 
Adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies: IoT sensors provided model inputs. Machine learning enhanced 
predictive analytics. Automated workflows enabled continuous monitoring. 
• 
Data-driven decision-making: Quantifiable outputs facilitated evidence-based strategies for resource 
allocation and process improvements. Future state modeling was evaluated to determine the best system 
configuration. 
 
Overall, the project demonstrated utilizing simulation to gain actionable insights for enhancing operations, service 
quality, and supply chain integration in the retail banking context. The findings from this project can be utilized by 
the managers to design a better system to maximize their customer satisfaction. Future researchers can utilize the 
methods employed in this study to perform more applied research aimed at resolving issues in analogous systems.

Abstract 
The overall geographical location of entire Bangladesh has displayed significant agricultural potential with a 
diversified crop portfolio. However, challenges hinder the growth of the region's agricultural supply chain. This study 
introduces a comprehensive and sustainable long-term framework for expanding the agricultural sector throughout 
Bangladesh. The research begins by examining the historical constraints that have characterized Bangladesh's 
agricultural economy, including subsistence farming and the dominance of intermediaries. Recent infrastructural 
improvements, such as new transportation networks, have opened up new opportunities for cultivating profitable crops 
like fruits and spices. Nevertheless, transportation remains a major barrier, impacting effective supply chain 
management and market access. To fully harness the agricultural potential of Bangladesh, we propose the 
implementation of a sustainable supply chain management structure founded on principles of sustainability, efficiency, 
and traceability. The study identifies sectors such as manufacturing, storage, transportation, packaging, marketing, 
and information sharing as areas requiring enhancement. Combining both quantitative and qualitative data gathered 
from 100 farmers through questionnaires and interviews, the study highlights issues like low agricultural yields, post-
harvest losses, inadequate storage facilities, costly transportation, crop damage during transit and storage, limited 
market opportunities, and poor information exchange. The suggested roadmap addresses these challenges by 
promoting improved farming practices, enhanced storage facilities, efficient transportation networks, appropriate 
packaging, expanded marketing avenues, and improved information flow. The adoption of this approach would lead 
to a more efficient, profitable, and environmentally sustainable agricultural supply chain throughout Bangladesh, 
benefiting farmers, consumers, and the nation as a whole. Collaboration among the local community, government, 
and commercial sector will be crucial for the effective implementation and overall growth of the region's agricultural 
sector.

1. Introduction
Unlocking the full agricultural potential of Bangladesh demands a strategic reevaluation of its supply chain dynamics, 
particularly in the context of a circular model and efficient transportation systems. This study embarks on a journey 
through the historical constraints that have shaped the agricultural landscape of Bangladesh, emphasizing the 
persistent challenges posed by subsistence farming practices and the presence of intermediaries in the supply chain. 
While recent infrastructural developments have created new opportunities for cultivating high-value crops, the 
inadequacies in transportation infrastructure continue to impede effective supply chain management and hinder market 
access. In response to these challenges, this research advocates for the establishment of a sustainable supply chain 
management framework, underpinned by principles of sustainability, efficiency, and traceability. By addressing key 
sectors such as manufacturing, storage, transportation, packaging, marketing, and information sharing, the proposed 
framework aims to enhance the overall efficiency and resilience of the agricultural supply chain. The entire geographic 
area of Bangladesh, as well as its southern portion, has substantial agricultural potential and is home to a wide variety 
of crops. However, several obstacles stand in the way of the expansion and effectiveness of the agricultural supply 
chain in the area. Thus, with a focus on the circular supply chain and transportation model, this study presents a 
comprehensive and sustainable long-term framework intended to extend the agricultural sector over the entirety of

5. Conclusion 
The envisioned sustainable agricultural supply chain management framework offers comprehensive solutions to the 
pressing challenges spanning production, storage, transportation, packaging, marketing, and information 
dissemination across the entire terrain. Besides, the execution of SCM methods must ensure that the flow of data and 
information between suppliers, distributors, manufacturers, and customers to be completely transparent. (Tajwar et al. 
2022).This roadmap seeks to fortify a more resilient and profitable agricultural supply chain by championing 
sustainability, efficiency, and traceability. It aims to overcome equipment inadequacies, reduce food wastage, and 
improve efficiency. Neighborhood-based cold storage hubs with frozen vans promise to maintain perishable goods' 
quality and enable direct delivery. Leveraging railways during challenging weather and a strategic network for 
transportation minimizes costs and optimizes delivery within the terrain. Integration of proper packaging and 
traceability ensures freshness and allows for data-driven issue resolution. This approach benefits farmers and 
consumers alike, enhancing the supply chain's efficiency and satisfaction. Overall, implementing these methodologies 
promises a transformative impact, fostering sustainable growth and prosperity for all stakeholders involved.

Abstract 
Jute fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites are highly desirable because they can offer sustainable alternatives to 
traditional materials. Researchers have been trying to improve the overall characteristics of these composites in different 
ways, alkali treatment is one of them. In this study, the effect of NaOH treatment on the mechanical characteristics of 
randomly distributed non-woven jute fiber-reinforced epoxy composites is investigated. The effects of various NaOH 
concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) on mechanical properties are investigated by experimentation. The composites 
were fabricated using hand layup followed by the compression molding method. The treatment of fibers using 5% NaOH 
solution showed a significant improvement in tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus, flexural modulus, and 
energy absorption while maintaining a tolerable elongation at break. The treatment of fibers using higher NaOH 
concentration caused a decrease in tensile and flexural properties due to possible fiber damage during treatment. Fiber 
treatment using NaOH is found to be effective for the enhancement of mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced 
composites but care should be taken to optimize the concentration of NaOH used for fiber treatment.

1. Introduction
Fiber-reinforced composites have become a sustainable choice for industries that require lightweight but high-strength 
materials. These composites are made of a matrix material that encases and binds together a reinforcing phase made of 
high-strength fibers. The final composite's mechanical, thermal, and occasionally even electrical properties are improved 
due to the interaction between the matrix and fibers (Kurien et al., 2023). These composites can be tailored to meet the 
needs of particular applications. The use of natural fibers as reinforcement materials is a noteworthy approach in the field 
of fiber-reinforced composites. Natural fibers, which come from sources like plants and animals, provide advantages 
compared to synthetic fibers because of their biodegradability, low cost, and environment-friendly nature. They conform 
to the sustainability criteria because they are renewable, biodegradable, and frequently produce with less energy. Because 
of their innate biocompatibility, these fibers are also appropriate for applications where it is inevitable that they will come 
in contact with humans or other living things. Jute fiber stands out as a particularly attractive option for composite 
reinforcement among the variety of natural fibers because of their wide availability and low cost. Its broad cultivation 
and quick rate of growth make it a resource that can be collected periodically and is sustainable. Additionally, jute fibers 
have outstanding mechanical qualities, such as good tensile strength and modulus, which puts them on pace with various 
synthetic fibers. Jute fibers have many qualities that make them suitable for use in composite material reinforcing. For 
instance, their elongated, adaptable shape improves load distribution inside the composite matrix, leading to increased 
mechanical integrity (Ashraf et al., 2019). Jute fibers also naturally absorb and release moisture, which can help alleviate 
problems with humidity-induced degradation that are frequently found in composite materials. The hygroscopic 
characteristic of jute-reinforced composites may be used to improve their overall toughness (Cottrell et al., 2023). 
Regardless of the inherent benefits that natural fibers have over their synthetic counterparts, it is noteworthy that the 
literature also highlights some limitations associated with natural fibers. For example, the tendency to absorb more 
water and less mechanical strength (Judawisastra et al., 2017; Nurazzi et al., 2018). The research landscape has seen 
the development of numerous tactics targeted at minimizing these limitations (Haque & Hasan, 2018; Jahan et al., 
2020). Alkali treatment of the fiber has become a crucial modification technique in this context, denoting a proactive 
strategy to improve the mechanical properties of the resultant composites.

The energy absorption during the bending test of the fabricated composites up to 11 mm displacement during the flexural 
test is shown in Fig. 5. The energy absorption of the untreated composite was found to be 0.55 J. A linear increase in 
energy absorption was seen after the jute fibers were treated with 5% and 10% NaOH, yielding values of 0.70 J and 0.80 
J respectively. Comparing this to the untreated composite, the percentage increases were 27.27% and 45.45% respectively. 
The energy absorption of the composites fabricated after treating the fibers using 15% NaOH is decreased to 0.57 J. The 
significant improvements at the 5% and 10% NaOH treatments imply that the material's capacity to absorb energy during 
deformation was significantly increased by these treatment concentrations, possibly as a result of improved fiber-matrix 
interaction and altered composite characteristics. However, the reduction in energy absorption with 15% NaOH treatment 
may be due to the considerable damage to the fibers by the stronger treatment solution, which might have affected the 
material's capacity to absorb energy. 
 
5.0 Conclusion and Future Research 
The effects of NaOH treatment on the mechanical characteristics of randomly distributed non-woven jute/epoxy 
composites were investigated in this study. A complex link between treatment concentration and some mechanical 
characteristics was found in this investigation. The composites fabricated using fibers treated with 5% NaOH 
concentration, in particular, demonstrated a notable improvement in tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus, 
flexural modulus, and energy absorption. The improvements were attributed to the increased fiber-matrix adhesion 
brought on by the treatment. The study also identified the threshold for NaOH concentration to be 5% NaOH. Increasing 
the concentration degrades the mechanical performance of the composites. The treatment of fiber may be a blessing for 
improving the properties of the fiber-reinforced composite materials but the concentration of alkali solution plays an 
important role in the mechanical properties of the composites because of the possibility of fiber damage at higher 
concentration. 
 
To further improve the mechanical properties of jute fiber composites, future studies should concentrate on improving 
treatment parameters, taking into account elements like NaOH content, treatment duration, and alternative surface 
modification approaches. Future research may concentrate on assessing the environmental sustainability of these 
composites and investigating eco-friendly treatment options to meet the increasing demand for green engineering 
techniques. Expanding the usability and economic relevance of NaOH-treated jute composites in various industries can 
be achieved by investigating their multifunctional capabilities and specialized applications, such as self-healing 
characteristics or use in automotive and aerospace components.

Abstract 
Urban areas grapple with a formidable challenge to sustainability and quality of life due to traffic congestion. This 
study examines the intricacies of traffic management in Dhaka City, investigating the potential of both the Human 
Traffic Management System (HTMS) and Automated Traffic Management System (ATMS) in alleviating gridlock 
and fostering sustainable transportation solutions. The inquiry commences with a comprehensive analysis of the 
existing traffic scenario in Dhaka City, pinpointing critical pain points and challenges contributing to persistent 
congestion. Subsequently, the study introduces two primary traffic management approaches: HTMS, characterized by 
human-operated systems, and ATMS, relying on automated technologies. Conducting an extensive comparative 
analysis, this research evaluates the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of both HTMS and ATMS within the 
unique traffic landscape of Dhaka City. Parameters such as real-time adaptability, scalability, environmental impact, 
and cost-effectiveness are carefully examined to gauge the overall sustainability of these systems. Moreover, the study 
delves into the social and economic implications of implementing HTMS and ATMS, incorporating perspectives from 
commuters, local businesses, and city planners. The exploration extends to the potential for integrating these systems, 
proposing a hybrid model that optimizes the strengths of both approaches. The research findings offer valuable insights 
for policymakers, urban planners, and traffic management authorities in Dhaka City, furnishing a roadmap for the 
adoption of sustainable traffic solutions. Ultimately, this study endeavors to shape the development of a tailored traffic 
management strategy that transcends gridlock, ensuring a sustainable and smoother traffic flow in Dhaka City.

Abstract 
To meet the high demand for poultry production, artificial egg hatching is needed. An incubator is a device that is 
used to successfully hatch fertile eggs under suitable environmental conditions by regulating the temperature and 
humidity of the enclosure. Temperature and humidity are the parameters that are controlled in hatching egg incubators 
in the poultry industry worldwide. Incubation conditions depend on the hatchability of the birds. Inappropriate 
temperature and humidity levels result in unwanted conditions during incubation. Temperature and humidity control 
in an incubator are critical during incubation. The source of power in an incubator is electrical energy. The proper use 
of energy is an important factor. Controlling the temperature of an egg incubator system can reduce electrical energy 
consumption. In this research, different kinds of incubators have been investigated and a new energy-saving egg 
incubator has been proposed. The possibility of the most suitable temperature for hatching an egg is about 35–40 °C; 
however, the optimum temperature should be kept at 37.5°C and humidity should be kept at 55%–60% during the 21 
days of incubation. A normal conventional controller is usually used in local poultry farms. The power consumption 
was about 56.08 kWh during the 21 days of incubation. For energy savings, a PID Control System was used with an 
Arduino UNO AT Mega 328P Microcontroller. Power consumption was recorded at 44.77 kWh during the 21 days 
of Incubation. For further development of the temperature control of this system, a fuzzy-PID controller is used and 
simulated, which has improved the temperature rise time and settling time compared to the conventional egg incubator. 
During the experimental operation, the power consumed was about 41.58 kWh for 21 days of Incubation. The result 
shows that the Fuzzy-PID controller can save 14.5 kWh more energy than conventional and save 3.19 kWh more 
energy than the PID Controller is more energy efficient than a conventional controller. However, Fuzzy-PID is more 
energy efficient than a PID Controller. Finally, it is found that a lot of energy has been saved because of the use of 
Fuzzy-PID instead of PID and conventional controllers.

Introduction 
Bangladesh is a densely populated country with 160 million people and a total area of 147,570 square kilometers. 
National population growth is high, so the demand for protein sources is necessary for health and well-being (Nur and 
Rahman, 2022) For the growth of protein, poultry farming is one of the necessary ingredients for the current purpose. 
So the farmers and scientists are paying attention to the production and development of poultry farming (Mariani 
2021). In 2016, the global annual meat production estimated by the UN Agricultural Outlook had reached 320.7 
million tons of meat and poultry, totaling 12.7 million tons (Okonkwo 2012). To improve nutrition and food security 
for national demand, poultry farming is a good solution for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). It can improve 
the income capacity of rural entrepreneurs and contribute to the national economy (Gabriel 2019). Natural Incubation 
performed by broody hens has low efficiency. The global yearly meat expenses per person are increasing day by day, 
and to reach the 35.3 kg retail weight equivalent by 2025, it will come from poultry sites. Poultry is one of the ways

The Calculation shows that Fuzzy-PID is more energy efficient than PID and Conventional Controller. 
 
5.7   Comparison of Power Consumption between Conventional, PID and fuzzy-PID 
For controlling the temperature in the egg incubator, we use different techniques like Conventional, PID and Fuzzy-
PID Controller. During the experiment work conventional controller takes 56.0028 kWh total power consumption in 
21 days of incubation. For energy saving PID Controller can takes 44.772 kWh total power consumption in 21 days 
of incubation. Further energy saving we use fuzzy-PID controller in the incubator. During the experimental work total 
power is consumed 41.538 kWh during 21 days of Incubation.  
Power Consumption Variation with time in Conventional, PID and Fuzzy-PID Monitoring Process is given on figure

For comparison, the Conventional controller takes too much power consume than PID Controller and fuzzy-PID 
controller is more energy efficient than PID controller. 
 
5.8   Proposed improvement  
In our proposed system minimizes the fluctuation and energy consumption of the existing incubator system and 
provide the energy-saving solution to this system. 
 
Conclusion 
The Energy-saving egg incubator system has been investigated in this research by controlling the temperature and 
maintaining the humidity using a Fuzzy-PID controller. For energy-saving operation, the brightness of the bulb is 
controlled as well as the temperature in the egg incubator system. In the experimental work, the following three 
controllers are used namely Conventional, PID, and Fuzzy-PID controller. The brightness of the bulb can’t be 
controlled in a conventional system. Therefore, a PID and Fuzzy-PID controller are used to regulate the voltage as 
well as the temperature and maintain the humidity in the egg incubator system. The experiment involved gathering 
60-minute temperature data for conventional, PID, and Fuzzy-PID controllers. The set temperature was 38°C. For 21 
days of incubation, the conventional controller consumed 56.08 kWh; however, PID consumed 44.77 kWh, whereas 
Fuzzy-PID consumed only 41.58 kWh. The PID has a significant amount of energy savings when compared to a 
conventional controller, which amounts to 20.05%. The energy savings of Fuzzy-PID compared to conventional 
controllers amount to 25.83%. The result shows that Fuzzy-PID controllers have lower power consumption compared 
to other controllers and found effective and efficient method in this purpose.

Abstract 
The potential to recover biogas and biosolids from piggery sludge was investigated as a waste management 
technique. Three 1L biodigesters were loaded with piggery slurry and anaerobic digestion took place over 35 days 
under mesophilic conditions of 35 ±1 ◦C. The piggery sludge properties which included pH, total solids (TS), 
chemical oxygen demand (COD), biogas, and biosolids compositions were measured using standard techniques. 
MATLAB R2013a was used for the determination of the linear models for changes in COD, TS, pH, and amount 
of biogas generated at a 95% confidence interval. The R2 and the SSE were used to determine the accuracy of the 
derived models. As the digestion period increased the sludge's total solids content and chemical oxygen demand 
decreased by 80% and 90% respectively. Cumulative biogas of approximately 4 L/day was achieved with a peak 
at 30 days. The biogas produced had a methane composition of 65%. Accurate models with R2 values of >0.9 can 
be used to determine the changes in the given parameters during biogas production. Anaerobic digestate was 
harnessed with an average of 4.2% nitrogen, 0.5% phosphorous, and 4.7% potassium.

1. Introduction
The piggery industry is among the major industries in Southern Africa and it generates a lot of unwanted biowaste 
(Kwasny et al. 2011). This piggery industry therefore poses an environmental threat if not properly managed due 
to the generation of greenhouse gases to the environment overall leading to climate change. The piggery industry 
provides waste in both liquid and solid forms and if not managed results in land, water, and air pollution (Campos 
et al., 2002; Gebreeyessus and Jenicek, 2016). The solid waste from the manure can be a source of raw material 
for biogas generation that can be used for renewable energy (methane) as well as a source for biofertilizers like 
any other source of biowaste (Makadi et al., 2012). The sources of waste generated in the piggery industry are 
shown in Figure 1.

4. Conclusion
The piggery sludge generated as waste can be managed through conversion to biogas and biosolids using 
anaerobic digestion. A rich biogas, which is a renewable energy source, was produced with methane content as 
high as 65%. Polynomial models generated from the valorization process can be used for determining the amount 
of biogas and biomethane generated. The anaerobic digestion produced during the process can be used as biosolids 
for application in agriculture due to their high composition of NPK.

is expected to become a company's competitive advantage. The Site selection process is not only about finding the 
optimal geographic point but also about synergy with the company's long-term business plan. Recently, a company 
not only focused on seeking profits, but the awareness about community and environment development around the 
site location has begun to grow in line with world priorities in managing various resources. The emergence of 
commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals makes companies not only focus on business but also on 
the sustainability of the surrounding community. Site selection is a multi-criteria decision-making problem, with the 
objective of finding the most optimal and profitable location for the company's sustainability, in previous research, 
site selection has several criteria to be considered such as costs, infrastructure, environment, and economics but did 
not consider aspects of potential community empowerment in the selection. This research aims to observe the influence 
of potential for community empowerment in the site selection process of a toy manufacturing factory by using the 
analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method to weigh the criteria and combine it with the TOPSIS method to determine 
the ranking of the available alternative locations.

1. Introduction
Choosing the optimal location for a factory is a challenge that will always exist, every year new businesses continue 
to develop and require expansion in terms of facilities and infrastructure to achieve business optimization. as a long-
term strategic plan, Many people try to calculate the best option that is close to an optimal location using the scientific 
method.  Often the choice of factory location in a location will have an impact on the environmental, social, and 
economic aspects of a location. The impact of selecting a factory location will be felt even in the process of building 
a factory, many aspects are starting to move in either a positive or negative based on factory construction. 
The site selection decision came from organizations that wish to establish or expand their activities, Identifying, 
analyzing, assessing, and selecting alternatives are part of the location decision process The selection of a site starts 
usually when the need to expand is considered, then the search for the best place will begin (Yang et al.1997). 
Choosing an optimal location will be very beneficial for a business, from the production process to the marketing 
process, many processes can be effective and efficient in their implementation. 
Challenge to solve problems related to determining optimal locations that include the involvement of various factors 
and criteria included in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). MCDM is utilized to select the most suitable option 
from a range of alternatives, especially in cases where there are multiple criteria for evaluation, and these criteria often 
present conflicting considerations. Therefore, MCDM stands out as a valuable approach for addressing issues related 
to the selection of sites (Hsieh et al.2004). Selecting a site location involves identifying the most advantageous location 
for a building or facility, taking into account the requirements of the structure, and weighing them against the benefits 
of various potential locations. This decision-making process is influenced by numerous conflicting factors or criteria 
(Hoover, 1948).

community empowerment criteria exhibited the least impact on site location selection decisions, contributing 
approximately 5%. Among the three alternative locations, alternative A stands out as the preferred alternative location 
with a substantial percentage of 45%. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this research, various criteria and sub-criteria were processed to obtain priorities for selecting the location of the 
toy factory, taking into account the potential for community empowerment. The criteria related to determining the 
location include cost criteria with sub-criteria of investment costs and minimum wages; infrastructure criteria with 
sub-criteria for the availability of transportation modes and utility availability; human resource criteria with job 
competency suitability; conduciveness criteria with sub-criteria for social conduciveness and general security; 
logistics criteria with sub-criteria for access to local and imported raw materials, as well as domestic and international 
marketing access; and community empowerment criteria with sub-criteria for the potential absorption of labor from 
the surrounding community and the potential implementation of CSR for the surrounding community.  
Based on the research results, logistics criteria is the criterion with the highest weight of influence, with a value of 
27%, compared to the weights of other criteria. Meanwhile, community empowerment criteria have the lowest level 
of influence with a weight value of 5% in the selection of the location of the ABC factory branch. Based on the AHP-
TOPSIS method processing in the research on the selection of the ABC factory branch location, the ranking results 
show that the alternative location A is the top priority, ranking first with a percentage of 45%, followed by Alternative 
B with a percentage of 41% in the second rank, and in the third rank is alternative C with a percentage of 14%.

Abstract 
A significant segment of the population in Bangladesh lacks access to quality healthcare, posing a challenge to the 
fundamental human right of health. The absence of a robust healthcare system has far-reaching implications across 
various socio-economic domains. This study aims to provide a detailed analysis of key aspects of non-government 
healthcare institutions in Bangladesh, encompassing institutional ownership, growth trends, workforce distribution, 
waste management practices, fire safety measures, and selected financial dimensions. Data essential for achieving the 
study's analytical objectives were gathered from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) survey of private 
healthcare institutions conducted in 2019. The findings reveal substantial growth in the non-government healthcare 
sector from 1990 to 2018, predominantly characterized by private ownership. Most of the workforce is comprised of 
full-time staff, with approximately 80% of non-government hospitals adhering to waste management and fire safety 
protocols. Hospitals emerge as the primary revenue generators among various non-government healthcare institutions. 
The analytical insights from this study offer policymakers valuable information to assess and address critical aspects 
of non-government healthcare institutions in Bangladesh, facilitating informed decision-making and effective policy 
implementation.

Abstract 
The lack of adequate infrastructure for most of the roads and routes in Peru has generated a saturation of the roads and 
longer transport times, which affects the state health sector presenting frequent situations of shortages of medicines 
for urgent and emergency cases nationwide due to various factors such as the use of ambulances used for the delivery 
of medicines in a very congested road infrastructure. This research proposes an emergency medicine distribution 
model to reduce delivery time and costs using drones (remotely piloted unmanned aerial vehicles). The distribution 
of medicines to thirteen medical posts using 4 ambulances in the northern area of Lima was analyzed and the results 
were compared with the distribution of medicines using 21 drones, providing care to 313,248 emergency cases, 
demonstrating the reduction of delivery times and costs. It can be concluded that the use of drones as a substitute in 
the distribution of emergency medications and medical items is a faster and 22 times less expensive means than 
traditional distribution using ambulances or distribution trucks, demonstrating that the model is viable to be 
implemented in the northern area of Lima.

1. Introduction
In Peru, the state health system is vulnerable due to situations such as the lack of sufficient personnel to provide quality 
care to patients treated in health centers and medical posts nationwide finding 47% of these centers with inadequate 
and/or insufficient infrastructure to provide medical services; with 44% facing difficulties of water supply and/or 
electricity; as well as 39% exposed to environmental pollution (Comptroller General of the Republic 2016).  Currently, 
this sector has frequent shortages of medicines for urgent and emergency cases at the national level in medical posts 
due to various factors, one of the most important being the use of ambulances as a means of ground transportation 
used in a very vulnerable road infrastructure due to the size of the vehicle fleet and the consequent road congestion 
(Baillargeat et al. 2022). In countries such as Malaysia, Sweden, Ghana, and Rwanda, situations similar to the Peruvian 
reality exist and thanks to the implementation of innovative solutions such as the use of drones for the distribution of 
emergency medicines, they have managed to improve their delivery times and performance, saving lives. The city of 
Metropolitan Lima is the urban area with the greatest traffic congestion and also has districts with the highest 
population concentration and the greatest number of state medical care centers; on the other hand, the supply of 
medicines using unmanned air transport, by drone, with less investment, reduced logistics costs and more efficient 
times (De Silvestri et al. 2022, Hiebert et al. 2020). In this regard, the research question is whether the use of drones 
(unmanned and remotely driven aerial vehicles) for the distribution of urgent and emergency medications in the state 
health care centers of Metropolitan Lima will reduce delivery times and costs.

5.4 Discussion 
Comparing the results of the research with other experiences, the case of Sweden stands out, which according to the 
study by Schierbeck et al (2019) the area in square kilometers covered is four times larger but they only manage to 
serve a population of 80,000 inhabitants, almost a 25.55% less than the proposed project. However, the Swedes used 
three drones, handling 14 real-life cases within 3 months compared to this study's 313,166 virtual cases from 21 
drones, within a year with seven iterations. Contrary to that of Rwanda, where reductions between 79 and 98 minutes 
were seen in deliveries; Thus, the Arena model, used in the northern area of Lima, showed results of 0 to 150 minutes 
saved, depending on the route and location served. In that sense, even though in some cases the savings are 50% for 
Rwanda, in emergency situations every minute is valuable and means a big difference in the result of the care provided. 
When comparing that in Peru there are 26 airports for an area of 1 285 215,60 km² compared to 38 airports that 
Germany has to serve 357 588 km², it is highlighted that there are rural areas that, being very far from the cities, are 
an excellent opportunity for medical care in remote areas to have a medicine distribution system through the use of 
drones. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study has addressed the problem of an inadequate medicine supply system in the northern region of Metropolitan 
Lima, proposing a medicine distribution system in state medical care centers in the northern area of Metropolitan 
Lima, using drones which would achieve lower distribution times and costs than the current level. 
 
The study carried out four simulations in the same scenario, the first two made a quantitative comparison between a 
drone and an ambulance; and the last two making an economic comparison, based on the same investment for a system 
using 21 drones versus an alternative of using 4 ambulances for the distribution of medicine, finding that one drone 
could attend a total of 15 471 cases, while the ambulance could only attend to 4 238 cases. With 21 drones it is feasible 
to attend to 313 166 cases, unlike with 4 ambulances it is only possible to attend to only 5,41% of the cases and in this 
way the distribution of medicines using drones would reduce response times, especially in critical situations providing 
faster and more effective care. 
 
The evaluation of operating costs, including depreciation, fuel, maintenance and permits, showed that the deployment 
of drones is more cost-effective compared to the use of ambulances. Additionally, the careful selection of the FoxTech 
Eagle 360 drone, with a lower acquisition cost and greater operating range, contributes significantly to the financial 
efficiency of the project. Likewise, the cost reduction is evident. In economic terms, serving the target population is 
viable if drones are used as a means of distribution. In order to meet that objective, 74 ambulances would be required. 
Consequently, the result was a saving of USD 10 593 921. The operating cost per distance is lower for a drone, 
obtaining a total of 13,02 USD cents per km compared to the figure of 51,80 USD cents per kilometer that the 
ambulance presented; That is, there is a difference of 38,78 USD cents per km, which shows that the innovative 
proposal is more economical. 
 
Consequently, the use of drones as a substitute in the distribution of emergency medications and medical items is a 
faster and 22 times less expensive means than traditional distribution using ambulances or distribution trucks. This 
demonstrated that the model has viability to be implemented in the northern area of Lima, with a service of thirteen 
medical posts to a greater expansion, without logistical complexities.

Abstract 
The sugar industry in Bangladesh, historically a linchpin of its economy, has confronted significant challenges in 
recent years, experiencing sustained losses that affect its ability to contribute substantially to the nation's burgeoning 
economic landscape. This study is a dedicated effort to dissect the root causes of the sector's current predicament, 
utilizing robust research methods. Primary data and information have been meticulously gathered from Rajshahi Sugar 
mills, forming the basis for a thorough analysis employing statistical tools such as fishbone diagrams, Pareto charts, 
and 5 why root cause analysis. The results of this analysis unequivocally point to a pervasive lack of raw materials as 
the primary culprit behind the sector's downturn. Additionally, the application of these analytical methods has 
unearthed other contributing factors that compound the challenges faced by the sugar industry in Bangladesh. Beyond 
merely highlighting these issues, the study takes a proactive stance by recommending specific corrective actions to 
address the identified problems. By presenting a comprehensive picture of the sector's struggles and proposing tangible 
solutions, this research aims to catalyze the revitalization of the sugar industry in Bangladesh. The proposed measures, 
rooted in a thorough understanding of the statistical analyses, aspire to position the sector for renewed growth and a 
more substantial role in the nation's economic narrative.

1. Introduction
Bangladesh has been growing sugarcane since very ancient times to produce sugar. In the 16th century, Bengal was 
widely recognized for its high-grade sugar. Every year, the East India Company exports significant amounts of sugar 
from Bengal. In 1795, the volume was 32807.44 metric tons, and in 1805, it was 132966.72 metric tons. The sugar 
industry started in Bangladesh in 1933, and 17 sugar mills were developed between 1933 and 2004. Bangladesh Sugar 
and Food Industries Corporation (BSFIC), which reports to the Ministry of Industries, oversees the sugar sector. A 
few years ago, sugar industries played a vital role in the national income of Bangladesh. But now the industries are 
running with losses. For this reason, recently the government shut down some sugar mills and the rest of the mills are 
running poorly. BSFIC Chairman Sanat Kumar Saha noted that the mills had been losing money for a long period due 
to a variety of factors, including decreased sugar mill output capacity. As a result, the factories are being closed for 
the time being as part of an effort to 'reform and modernize' industry. Speaking with a few managing directors, it was 
discovered that the letter ordering the shutdown of sugar mill output made no mention of any intentions for reform or 
modernization. They believe that even if production is suspended, they can avoid losses worth 'crores of takas' by 
retaining the current compensation structure. Fifteen state-owned sugar mills have been losing roughly Tk 10 billion 
per year due to a variety of factors such as excess personnel, decaying machineries, a lack of raw materials, rising 
interest rates on long-term bank loans, and the suspension of production for nearly 10 months of the year. For these 
reasons, white sugar produced in private refineries sells for Tk 60 to Tk 80 per kg, whereas sugar produced in 
government mills sells for Tk 250 to Tk 300 per kg. As a result, the indebted firms are having difficulty repaying their

approach employed involves the application of statistical analyses, specifically utilizing tools such as fishbone 
diagrams and Pareto charts with the aid of Excel. Through these analytical techniques, the research aims to extract 
essential insights into the multifaceted challenges that have led to the downturn of the sugar industry in the country. 
Rajshahi sugar mills, chosen as a focal point for this investigation, serves as a microcosm for understanding the broader 
trends and issues afflicting the sugar sector in Bangladesh. By delving into the statistical intricacies of the industry 
using fishbone diagrams, the study seeks to identify the root causes of the financial losses incurred by sugar mills in 
recent years. This comprehensive analysis is poised not only to shed light on the current predicament but also to offer 
practical solutions that can potentially reverse the sector's declining fortunes. The reliance on statistical tools like 
Pareto charts adds a layer of granularity to the study, allowing for the identification of key factors that 
disproportionately contribute to the challenges faced by the sugar industry.  
 
The Pareto principle, commonly known as the 80/20 rule, suggests that a significant proportion of effects often stem 
from a minority of causes. Through the application of Pareto analysis, the research aims to pinpoint these critical 
factors, providing a prioritized list of issues that demand immediate attention. The study maintains its significance as 
a potential catalyst for positive change in the sugar sector. The insights garnered from the statistical analyses, even 
within the confines of the current study parameters, are expected to offer a foundational understanding of the 
challenges faced by the industry. Moreover, the research endeavors to not only diagnose the issues but also prescribes 
corrective actions based on the findings. This study represents a concerted effort to bring clarity to the perplexing 
challenges plaguing the sugar industry in Bangladesh. By leveraging statistical methods and focusing on a specific 
case study, the research seeks to contribute valuable insights that can inform policy decisions and strategic 
interventions. Through transparency regarding the study's limitations and a forward-looking approach to future 
research enhancements, this endeavor aspires to play a pivotal role in the revitalization of the sugar sector, ultimately 
contributing to the economic growth of Bangladesh. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this comprehensive study, various statistical analysis tools are deployed with the primary objective of discerning 
the root causes behind the financial losses and subsequent shutdowns plaguing the sugar industry. The analytical 
framework included the construction of a fishbone diagram to systematically identify the predominant factors 
contributing to the industry's challenges. Subsequently, a Pareto chart is employed to highlight the critical few or root 
causes that demand immediate attention. To delve deeper into understanding these root causes, a 5 Why root cause 
analysis was conducted, unraveling the underlying issues and paving the way for targeted improvements. The research 
successfully pinpointed the fundamental reasons behind the industry's predicament, serving as the foundation for the 
proposed solutions. In addition to root cause identification, the study extends its contribution by recommending 
corrective actions aimed at ameliorating the overall situation. By combining these analytical tools, the research not 
only diagnoses the problems afflicting the sugar industry but also provides a roadmap for effective and sustainable 
solutions. 
 
The identified root cause of the challenges faced by the sugar industry is the shortage of raw materials, which 
significantly affects the entire production process and subsequently drives up production costs. This shortage hampers 
the mills' ability to produce large quantities of sugar within a short milling period. Compounding this issue is the fact 
that the industry operates under government ownership, with the selling authority firmly in the hands of governmental 
entities. The government's intervention in market control further exacerbates the problem, as producers are directed 
to withhold their sugar stocks for extended periods, anticipating better selling conditions during challenging times. 
Consequently, when these sugar stocks are eventually released into the market, the oversupply results in a decline in 
selling prices. In contrast, during times of ample raw material availability in the past, mills could produce significant 
sugar quantities, enabling them to both store and sell the product at higher market prices. However, in the current 
scenario of raw material scarcity, the mills face a dual challenge of insufficient production to meet market demand 
and the inability to store surplus sugar for strategic selling. This intricate interplay of raw material shortages and 
government market control underscores the complexity of the issues confronting the industry, necessitating a 
multifaceted strategy to address both the immediate production constraints and the broader market dynamics shaped 
by government directives.

Abstract 
Urbanization and industrialization have markedly affected air quality, notably in Dhaka City, which has become a 
focal point for heightened air pollution. This study utilizes advanced statistical modeling techniques to uncover the 
multifaceted determinants impacting air quality in Dhaka's urban landscape. The primary objective is to systematically 
analyze and comprehensively understand the various factors influencing air quality in the urban context of Dhaka. 
Data encompassing air quality, meteorological parameters, traffic emissions, industrial emissions, and residential 
emissions were collected for urban Dhaka. A regression model was constructed to predict air quality levels based on 
this data, revealing significant impacts of temperature, humidity, wind speed, traffic volume, vehicle type, fuel 
consumption, and emissions from industrial facilities and households (p-value < 0.01). The statistical model 
demonstrated a robust predictive capability with an R-squared of 0.86. In conclusion, our study identifies major 
pollution contributors, outlines seasonal patterns, and locates pollution hotspots. The validated statistical models 
underscore the reliability of our findings, providing critical insights for policymakers and recommending targeted 
interventions to mitigate air pollution and improve overall urban air quality in Dhaka.

Abstract 
In Peru, the beer industry produced 998 million liters during 2020, and its manufacturing process generates various 
agro-industrial waste such as Brewer Spent Grain (BSG), equivalent to 80% of all agro-industrial waste generated 
approximately 570 million tons in the year 2020. This research aims to establish whether BSG as a residual product 
can function as a substrate for the cultivation and production of Pleurotus ostreatus mushrooms, offering an alternative 
to existing commercial substrates by evaluating the performance of its characteristics such as pH level, presence of 
ash, nitrogen, its biological efficiency (kg of mushroom/kg substrate), its productivity (biological 
efficiency/cultivation time), among other factors. An experimental design of mushroom cultivation was carried out 
according to the conventional assisted fruiting method in polyethylene bags. The laboratory analyses concluded that 
BSG as a substrate for the cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus had a biological efficiency of 27,25% lower than the 
results of other substrates such as corn and coffee pulp, which have a biological efficiency of 68% and 70% 
respectively; although it presented a productivity of 0,605 compared to similar studies that on average had a 
productivity of 0,75. The study showed that BSG is a good substrate for the cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus and it 
is expected that its performance can improve when used as a mixed miscellaneous substrate, offering a new circular 
economy alternative for the brewing industry.

1. Introduction
The beer industry in Peru has shown constant growth, in 2020 a production of 998 million liters was estimated (Castillo 
2021), and 47% of per capita alcohol consumption in Peru corresponds to Beer (Quispe 2018). Beer production 
generates a high volume of solid waste, derived from different stages in the brewing process. Of the most relevant 
wastes are the following: Brewer's Spent Grain (BSG), is the barley left over from the malting process, which 
represents 80% of industrial waste; Hot tub is the name given to the remaining hops from the production process and 
Brewer's Spent Yeast (BSY) is the remaining yeast from the fermentation process (Dos Santos et al. 2015). 
It is important to mention that on average to produce 22 liters of craft beer Ale, 12,5 kg of barley is required, which 
will end up becoming BSG; this amount varies depending on the recipe used by the producer (Mencia and Perez 2016). 
One of the main differences between industrial and artisanal brewing is the amount of barley used per production 
batch, with the artisanal method requiring more than double the amount of barley used per batch produced;

The last indicator is the amount of substrate spent; After the final harvest, the bags were weighed, resulting in 18,5 kg 
of spent substrate, a mixture of substrate and fungus, representing 92,5% of the initial weight. 
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements  
Las pruebas realizadas han brindado la posibilidad de generar futuros estudios, considerando los siguientes criterios: 
• 
Constantly control temperature and humidity variables, as well as ensure the safety of the growing 
environment, this allows better development of fruiting bodies and can prevent the appearance of pests that 
damage crops. 
• 
Compensate the pH level of the BSG with some other substance, which would allow better colonization of 
the mycelium and increase the productivity of the process. 
• 
Use a substrate of higher density mixed components, which compensate for the dimensions of the BSG and 
its PH level. 
• 
Perform laboratory tests during the first week of obtaining the BSG in order to obtain the most accurate data 
on its initial composition. 
• 
Carry out the inoculation of the substrate as soon as possible and at a temperature below 40 °C, greatly 
reducing the possibility of contamination by external agents and avoiding using the pasteurization process. 
 
5.3 Validation 
The first indicator studied was the pH level of the BSG, obtaining a level of 4.21, which is a value that is too acidic 
compared to other studies, where substrates with pH levels between 6,7 and 7 were used (Hoa et al. 2015), despite 
this, Pleurotus Ostreatus has the ability to grow in substrates with a pH between 4 and 7, although these extremes 
significantly reduce the efficiency of the crop. 
 
As for the second indicator referring to the characterization of the substrate, it is the amount of ash present, being 2,86 
g per 100 g of dry mass (DM), this value is relatively low compared to other studies that used quinoa residues as 
substrate, which presented 9,9 g per 100 g of DM (Maccapa 2021). 
The last indicator referring to the substrate is the percentage of Nitrogen present in the dry mass, the result being 
2,71%, which is a high value compared to other substrates based on sawdust, which present values between 0,8 and 
1,2% (Hoa et al. 2015). 
 
With respect to production, the first and perhaps the most important indicator is the biological efficiency obtained, 
which was 27,25%, this value is low considering biological efficiencies ranging from 68% to 72%, coming from crops 
that They use corn and coffee pulp (Prieto 2017). 
The next indicator is the productivity of the crops, this being 0,605, a quite acceptable value compared to other works 
that obtained 0,75 (Mendoza 2020), despite this, this value can be greatly improved in more controlled cultivation 
environments. 
 
Finally, with respect to the spent substrate, it should not be discarded, since the most inoculated parts, which present 
a higher concentration of mycelial branches in the substrate, can be used to inoculate new cultures, and most of the 
leftover substrate It can be used as animal food thanks to its high protein and fibrous content. 
Based on the results, if this project is implemented, a new purpose would be provided to the BSG, leaving aside its 
treatment as waste and implementing the circular economy system, it would take the role of raw material to generate 
a new product that provides benefits. both economic and social, in turn, the amount of waste discarded would be 
reduced, reducing the environmental impact of the beer production process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the research, we can conclude that it was indeed possible to determine the efficiency of BSG as a unique substrate 
for the cultivation of oyster mushrooms, however, this efficiency was not as expected, and has certain deficiencies

compared to other agro-industrial waste. Despite this, BSG still has good characteristics to be used for this purpose 
and as the main component for some mixed substrate. 
 
From the experimental study carried out, it can be concluded that BSG can be used as a substrate for the cultivation 
of mushrooms, thus allowing small, medium and large brewing companies to take advantage of this agro-industrial 
waste by applying circular economy concepts and reducing the pollution levels generated. by their companies. 
It can be concluded at the end of the research that by introducing a new substrate option such as BSG to the market 
for mushroom cultivation, it would promote the industry and trade of edible mushrooms, facilitating access for 
consumers to purchase this healthy product. in addition to reducing the cost of production, since an agroindustrial 
waste that is generated in abundance is used as raw material.

Abstract 
The cantilever beam serves as a prominent choice for harnessing strain-based energy through piezoelectric materials. 
Ongoing research is focused on enhancing the output power density from cantilever energy harvesters. Most of the 
prior investigations have predominantly employed fully coated cantilever beams. However, due to the high cost 
associated with piezoelectric materials, it becomes necessary to explore the impact of altering the base beam’s length 
while keeping the piezoelectric material's length constant. This investigation aims to ascertain the potential for 
increasing the output power density using the same length of piezoelectric material. In this study, a comprehensive 
analysis was conducted, maintaining uniform thickness and width for both the base beam and piezoelectric material. 
The positioning of the piezoelectric material on the base beam was selected to maximize power output for a specific 
configuration. Recognizing that the power output of a cantilever energy harvester is dependent upon the resonant 
frequency and optimal electrical load, this study also presents an analysis of these factors. It is found that an increase 
in the length of the base beam causes a corresponding rise in output power. Particularly, tripling the length of the base 
beam yields a sevenfold increase in output power density.

1. Introduction
In the search for sustainable energy sources and the reduction of dependence on traditional power generation methods, 
the field of energy harvesting has attracted attention. Energy harvesting involves converting ambient energy (e.g., 
mechanical vibrations, temperature differences, and sunlight) into usable electrical energy. Among the various 
techniques, piezoelectric energy harvesting has drawn considerable attention as a potential approach for converting 
ambient energy into usable electrical power. It utilizes the piezoelectric effect to convert mechanical vibrations into 
electrical energy. The piezoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon where piezoelectric materials produce an electric 
charge when the material is subjected to deflection. On the other hand, Cantilever beams have emerged as a preferred 
choice of vibration energy harvesting due to their higher average strain compared to other configurations (Roundy, 
Wright and Rabaey 2003). 
The output power density in piezoelectric energy harvesting is greatly influenced by the beam's geometry. Research 
has shown that trapezoidal beam geometry offers superior performance over rectangular geometry (Zhang et al., 
2017). A comprehensive analysis by Pradeesh and Udhayakumar (2019b) studied the impact of taper in different 
cantilever beam geometries, including rectangular, trapezoidal, and inverted trapezoidal shapes. An innovative T-
shaped piezoelectric energy harvester design was proposed by Alameh et al. (2018) aiming to enhance the overall 
performance of the system. Sunithamani et al. (2017) investigated unimorph piezoelectric energy harvesters by 
varying the shape of the proof mass. Their findings demonstrated that a disc-shaped proof mass outperformed a ring-
shaped proof mass. Salem et al. (2021) delved into the relationship between resonance frequency, output power, and 
working range by varying the length of piezoelectric material segments. Wang et al. (2020) analyzed the impact of

Figure 4. Maximum output power density for different 'l/x' ratios corresponding to their resonant frequencies. 
 
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate a trend that the resonant frequency of the energy harvester tends to decrease as the 'l/x' ratio 
increases. In the context of cantilever beams, the resonant frequency is dependent on the beam's stiffness. As the 
stiffness of the beam grows, so does its resonant frequency. However, an increase in the 'l/x' ratio contributes to a 
higher overall weight of the energy harvester. This, in turn, results in a greater deflection in the beam. Enhanced 
deflection signifies a reduction in stiffness. Consequently, the resonant frequency experiences a corresponding 
decrease.  
 
 
Figure 5. Variation of optimal resistance with ‘l/x’ ratios. 
 
Following the principle of maximum power transfer, the peak output power is attained when the external load 
resistance aligns with the internal impedance of the piezoelectric cantilever beam. Internal impedance is typically 
governed by the capacitance and the frequency to which the beam is exposed, displaying an inverse relationship. Since 
the dimensions of the piezoelectric material remained constant throughout the study, variations in internal impedance 
were due to changes in the excitation frequency of the beams. Fig. 5 shows that the optimal resistance for the beams 
rises in correlation with the ratios. This is because of a decrease in the resonant frequency as the ratio increases (see 
Fig. 4). Given that the energy harvester achieves its highest output power density at its resonant frequency, the increase 
in optimal electric load or resistance is a result of the reduced resonant frequency. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper presents the impact of altering the base beam length on the output power density of piezoelectric cantilever 
energy harvesters, while maintaining a constant length of the piezoelectric material.   The findings reveal a direct 
relation between the base beam length and the output power density, i.e., the output power density increases almost 
linearly with the increase of base beam length. A threefold increase in the base beam length leads to a sevenfold 
increase in output power density. Considering the significantly higher cost of piezoelectric material than that of the 
base beam material, the increase in base beam length can significantly reduce the cost of energy harvesting by 
improving the output power density. While higher base beam ratios can provide a higher power density, there is a

trade-off with reduced bandwidth. Moreover, the added mass due to the elongation of the base beam contributes to 
more deflection and this leads to a decrease in the resonant frequency. This reduction in the resonant frequency results 
in a rise in the optimal resistance.

Abstract 
Within the Indonesian National Police, the marine police unit plays a critical role in the post-disaster context, providing 
vital assistance to communities affected by natural calamities, particularly those related to search and rescue operations 
(SAR). To carry out their duties effectively, the marine police must have access to suitable resources, including 
appropriate ships. Therefore, this study aims to identify alternative hospital ships that meet the criteria set by the 
marine police for their operations. To do this, the study uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to 
determine the relative importance of each criterion used to evaluate potential alternatives. By utilizing the AHP 
method, the marine police can make informed decisions on the selection of hospital ships that will be used for their 
search and rescue operations. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to enhance the ability of the marine police to carry 
out their duties in protecting the safety and security of the Indonesian people. Once the calculations were completed 
based on the 4 established criteria and 13 sub-criteria, the most suitable option for the Hospital Ship for the marine 
police was determined and it is the ship 4 out of the other 4 alternatives.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is an archipelagic country located at the confluence of four tectonic plates, including the Asian and 
Australian Continental Plates, the Indian Ocean Plate, and the Pacific Ocean. Southern and eastern parts of Indonesia 
consist of volcanic belts that stretch from Sumatra to Sulawesi and include old volcanic mountains and swamps. 
(BNPB n.d.). Indonesia's coastline spans 95,181 km, making it the world's second-longest coastline and comprising 
71% of its entire territory with 17,504 islands, Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic nation and depends heavily 
on its seas for survival (Indonesia n.d.). Under these conditions, Indonesia is vulnerable to natural disasters, such as 
volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and landslides. Indonesia has a high level of seismicity, more than 
ten times that of the United States, making it one of the world's most seismically active countries. 
As is widely known, Indonesia is situated in an area known for its active volcanoes and tectonic plate faults, making 
it highly vulnerable to natural calamities like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Given this vulnerability, it is

investigations conducted in the pharmaceutical sectors of Ireland, and Malaysia. This research explores the unique 
challenges faced by pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh as they strive to implement lean methodologies. The 
study utilizes a survey methodology, gathering insights from industry professionals to identify prevalent barriers and 
facilitators. Initial findings suggest that regulatory complexities, similar to those observed in Ireland, pose significant 
obstacles to the successful integration of lean practices. Concerns about additional validation activities and the clash 
between compliance and quality cultures are particularly prominent. Despite these challenges, the paper reveals a 
widespread recognition of the need for continuous improvement, aligning with the global trend observed in the 
pharmaceutical sectors of Ireland and Malaysia. The study further examines the incorporation of lean tools into 
corrective and preventive action systems, deviations, and internal audit protocols within the pharmaceutical production 
landscape of Bangladesh. This research helps to uncover the specific barriers in the context of Bangladesh, 
contributing to a broader understanding of the obstacles to lean implementation in the pharmaceutical sector. 
Furthermore, it provides valuable insights for developing strategies to mitigate these barriers and enhance operational 
efficiency, ultimately reducing lead time in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process.

Abstract 
In response to the growing need for autonomous systems that can interpret complex visual information akin to human 
cognition, this study introduces a probabilistic machine learning approach for visual object detection, demonstrating 
significant strides in identifying images through a computational model that emulates human cognitive precision. The 
method begins with capturing images via video cameras, followed by an algorithmic learning phase that employs Blob 
Analysis to discern diverse object features such as color, shape, and region. These attributes are cataloged in a 
database, facilitating the matching and recognition of objects against a learned dataset. This technique refines the 
focus-of-attention mechanism, ensuring high probability that non-target regions do not contain the object of interest. 
The proposed system shows exceptional promise in optical character recognition and content-based image indexing, 
with experimental results underscoring its efficiency and accuracy in object detection. This advancement could 
significantly impact robotic vision systems, enhancing their interpretative capabilities in varied and complex 
environments.

Table 1 displays the probability calculations comparing features such as area, perimeter, and density between a mobile 
phone and a pen. Using the formula, the probability is computed as the average of these comparative values, resulting 
in 14.2%. This low probability indicates that the input image does not match the mobile phone profile in the database, 
leading to the conclusion that the input image is not that of a mobile.

Incorporating the probability calculation for an input image against the mobile profile in our database, we derive a 
probability of 95% for a mobile (see Table 3). Since this value exceeds the 80% threshold, we can confirm that the 
input image is indeed that of a mobile phone. This high probability demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in 
accurately identifying objects by comparing extracted feature values against a predefined database.

We perform a linear comparison by matching the input image's values with the values of all images in the database, 
resulting in a linear time complexity for the calculation method, which is denoted as O(n) time. This denotes that the 
time taken for the comparison is directly proportional to the number of images in the database. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The implications of this study are multifaceted and far-reaching. By successfully demonstrating a probabilistic 
machine learning approach to visual object detection, this research can significantly influence the development of 
autonomous systems capable of complex visual interpretation. The methodology's accuracy in identifying objects 
through features like area, perimeter, and density paves the way for more intuitive and interactive robotics, particularly 
in fields requiring precision such as manufacturing and quality control. Furthermore, the application in optical 
character recognition and image indexing can revolutionize how machines process and organize visual data, offering 
improvements in areas such as digital archiving, surveillance, and user-interface design. The study's linear comparison 
approach, with its O(n) time complexity, offers a scalable solution for real-time object detection, which is critical for 
systems requiring immediate response and decision-making capabilities. 
 
This study presents a significant leap forward in the field of computer vision, particularly in the domain of object 
detection. By introducing a probabilistic approach that leverages feature extraction from partial objects, this research 
moves towards closing the gap between current object detection capabilities and the nuanced requirements of real-
world applications. The developed model not only detects but also learns from various object features, thereby 
enhancing the precision and adaptability of robotic vision systems. Through this work, we have taken a step closer to 
replicating human-like perception in machines, demonstrating potential applications in space exploration, public 
security, and beyond. The future of autonomous systems looks promising, with such advancements heralding a new 
era of intelligent, perceptive robotics equipped to handle the complexities of their environments.

Abstract 
Digital technologies (DTs) play a major role in supporting the transition towards a circular economy (CE). 
Simultaneously, industrial symbiosis (IS) is a strategy that has emerged to support the practice of developing circular 
economy (CE) ecosystems. It is a form of mutually beneficial relationship among cross-sector industries aiming to 
achieve competitive advantages based on the reuse and exchange of waste, byproducts, and materials. However, the 
implementation of (IS) strategy is complex and requires collaboration and the exchange of information between 
different stakeholders. (DTs) such as blockchain and artificial intelligence can play a detrimental role in this matter. 
However, there is currently very little research on using both (DTs) for industrial symbiosis. To fill this research gap, 
this paper explores the intersection of (IS) and (DTs) concepts. First, it provides systematic literature based on the 
selection of specified keywords and search parameters in the Scopus database. Finally, it proposes a research agenda 
for researchers and practitioners interested in this field.

Abstract 
Amidst the epoch of the fourth industrial revolution, a discernible imperative surface within the steel industry 
necessitated the replacement of the archaic Defect Inspection System (DIS). The profound fiscal repercussions 
stemming from substandard steel underscore the exigency for this transition. Real-time diagnostics, a pivotal facet of 
quality control in manufacturing, grapples with inherent challenges, notably low automation and inconsistent flaw 
detection on steel surfaces. In response, a groundbreaking approach has materialized in the form of machine vision-
based models, strategically devised to surpass the capabilities of conventional DIS and elevate the quality of produced 
steel. In the course of our study, we addressed flaws in six hot-rolled steel predicaments, leveraging a dataset 
encompassing ten critical surface defects: inclusion, pitted surface, crazing, rolled-in scale, patches, and scratches, 
thereby confronting the challenges previously articulated. Upon meticulous analysis of the dataset, our model, the 
Vision-Based Transformer (VIT), attained an exceptional accuracy rate of 98%. Four distinct machine learning 
models—Xception, ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB2, and MobileNetV2—were enlisted for performance evaluation, 
ultimately revealing the superiority of the VIT in the domain of vision-based Defect Inspection Systems.

1. Introduction
In terms of quantity and versatility of application, steel is arguably the most significant metal. The rise of industrial 
society has benefited greatly from steel. The most crucial quality factors, especially for items made of flat-rolled steel, 
are surface characteristics coupled with other attributes (Neogi et al 2014). These steels are employed in the production 
of various industrial machinery. The most crucial step in lowering the risk to safety and monetary loss is the 
identification of industrial machinery and associated workpieces. Surface imperfections differ amongst workpieces. 
There are various defects in the surface of steel plates such as ""pitting”, “burr"", ""scratch”, “crack"" etc. These flaws 
pose a risk to consumer safety in addition to lowering product quality. As a result, a popular area of study is the 
classification of surface defects in industrial workpieces. Workpiece defects can originate from a variety of industries, 
including manufacturing, construction, and electrical work (Li. et al 2022). Hot-rolled steel stands as a pivotal 
constituent in construction applications owing to its robustness and economic viability. Commonly available hot-
rolled steel is produced by rolling steel at temperatures above 1700°F, which is far higher than the temperature at 
which most steels recrystallize. Steel products subjected to hot-rolling processes are known to have an extremely high 
rate of surface flaws of various kinds during the manufacturing process. Because of human error, manual strip 
inspection during production is labor-intensive and prone to mistakes. Therefore, automated techniques are preferred

causes, thereby facilitating timely remediation. This not only translates into economic savings by mitigating monetary 
losses but also serves as a judicious means of optimizing manpower costs. In essence, the deployment of the Vision 
Transformer model transcends mere efficiency, presenting itself as a boon to industries grappling with the temporal 
and financial challenges associated with manual detection processes.

Abstract 
The initial phase of digestion involves the crucial process of mastication, where teeth play a pivotal role. Beyond their 
functional significance in breaking down food, teeth are intricately tied to human articulation, speech, and facial 
aesthetics. Well-maintained teeth contribute to facial symmetry, attractiveness, and self-assurance, impacting an 
individual's overall well-being. Dental health not only boosts confidence but also stimulates the jawbone during 
chewing, enhancing bone density and strength. This interconnection between dental health and various aspects of life 
underscores the fundamental importance of maintaining healthy teeth. Dentistry, as a response to this imperative need, 
has evolved into specialized branches such as prosthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, endodontics, 
periodontics, and orthodontics. Each branch relies on specific materials tailored to its requirements, emphasizing the 
ongoing development of cutting-edge materials. This comprehensive review delves into the extensive array of 
materials used across dental specialties, exploring their properties, applications, and the critical considerations of 
biocompatibility and economic feasibility. The importance of choosing materials that offer long-term value while 
considering economic implications is highlighted. Biocompatibility assessments ensure materials are compatible with 
the human body. In summary, this review provides a detailed examination of dental materials, emphasizing their merits 
and demerits in light of biocompatibility and economic considerations. It serves as a valuable resource for 
policymakers, practitioners, and patients in selecting materials that ensure the sustainability and accessibility of 
dentistry for all. The exploration of these pivotal concepts contributes to shaping the future landscape of dental care.

1. Introduction
Human teeth are crucial for the consumption of food and are also interconnected with human speech and facial 
aesthetics. Undeniably, teeth have a significant impact on our everyday existence. Dental conditions such as tooth 
decay, the partial or complete loss of tooth tissue, and other negative consequences resulting from accidents or the 
aging process are inevitable. Consequently, artificial dental materials have been created and are presently employed 
to address and rectify issues affecting human teeth (Zhou and Zheng 2002). Dental science is developing at a young 
age due to the need to maintain healthy teeth. We can see how dentistry has developed over time from the table below. 
Numerous specialist parts are being produced daily as dentistry develops. Orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, 
oral and maxillofacial surgery, and other specialized fields are included. All of them utilized various materials, 
including metal, ceramics, composites, nanomaterials, smart materials, and others. Therefore, we must acquire the 
necessary expertise to select the appropriate material for a certain term. In this essay, we cover these topics in terms 
of their applications. The historical trajectory of dentistry is venerable and far from nascent. Its evolutionary 
progression can be discerned conspicuously through a comprehensive exposition encapsulated within Table 1. 
Table 1.Majumdar (2002) and Krishnan and Davidovitch (2021) describe the development of modern dentistry. This 
table shows how dental knowledge gradually increased between 1778 to 1900.

Abstract 
This paper offers a comprehensive perspective on the implementation of Circular Supply Chain Management 
(CSCM) in the plastic industry within emerging economies, with a special focus on Bangladesh. As a developing 
country, Bangladesh is increasingly directing its attention towards green initiatives, sustainability, and robust 
waste management practices. The nation's commitment to these principles is pivotal in shaping responsible 
industrial practices and contributing to global sustainability goals. CSCM, integrating Circular Economy (CE) 
principles into supply chain management, presents a novel approach aligned with Bangladesh's dedication to 
environmentally conscious development. Despite the potential benefits, the practical application of CSCM 
encounters challenges attributed to various barriers. This study, conducted in the context of Bangladesh, not only 
characterizes these obstacles but also incorporates insights from subcontinental researchers who have delved into 
this field. Their valuable contributions provide a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities 
associated with CSCM in the Bangladeshi plastic industry. Through an extensive literature review and industry 
experts, barriers have been identified and categorized into major groups. The paper employs the Multiple Criteria 
Decision Making (MCDM) method to systematically prioritize these barriers. By adopting the MCDM approach, 
this research not only adds valuable insights into the impediments of CSCM implementation in the Bangladeshi 
plastic industry but also serves as a foundational resource for managers and policymakers. It provides a roadmap 
for navigating the challenges associated with sustainable practices, thereby contributing to the broader discourse 
on responsible and environmentally friendly industrial operations in the context of Bangladesh's development 
trajectory.

Making (MCDM) methodology. 
1. Introduction
In recent years, the global discourse on sustainable business practices has witnessed a paradigm shift from the 
conventional linear economic model to the innovative Circular Economy (CE) framework. Central to this 
transition is the emergence of Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM), a holistic approach that integrates 
circular economy principles into supply chain operations. The amalgamation of the CE approach along with 
supply chain management is called circular supply chain management (CSCM); (Khan & Ali 2022). Recognized 
as a superior alternative to the traditional ""take, make, and dispose"" model, CSCM has garnered significant 
attention in academia and industry alike. Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM), which integrates the 
philosophy of the circular economy into supply chain management, offers a new and compelling perspective to 
the supply chain sustainability domain (Farooque et al. 2019). However, despite the growing interest in CSCM, a 
critical examination of the existing literature reveals a notable gap in providing a comprehensive and integrated 
view of this emerging concept.  
The absence of a unified definition and a clear distinction from other sustainability concepts hinders the 
progression of CSCM research. This necessitates a thorough investigation and classification of related 
terminologies to lay the groundwork for a cohesive understanding of CSCM. The following study identifies key 
directions for further research, highlighting areas such as design for circularity, procurement, biodegradable 
packaging, collaboration, consumption, and technological aspects. Furthermore, the relevance of CSCM is 
underscored by its potential to address pressing environmental concerns, resource scarcity, and escalating waste 
levels. Circular supply chain management is a recent innovation to save resources and reduce waste in the supply 
chain of any industry (Amiri et al. 2022). The urgency of adopting circular principles in supply chains is 
exemplified by the challenges faced by diverse industries, ranging from pharmaceuticals to plastics, in their pursuit

compelling plastic companies to adopt circular practices have faced opposition from organizations due to their 
strict nature and unclear procedures (Aryan et al. 2019). This aligns with prior research indicating that the absence 
of tax rebate policies poses a significant challenge to the initiation of circular practices (Khandelwal & Barua, 
2020; Mathiyazhagan et al. 2016; Narayanan et al. 2019; Rizos et al. 2016; Singh & Sarkar, 2019; Sivakumar et 
al. 2018). 
 
Financial barriers emerge as the second most prominent obstacle, underscoring the necessity of financial support 
for plastic organizations to embrace Circular Economy (CE) practices. Despite this need, a well-established capital 
investment system for such practices is lacking, leading plastic organizations to struggle to secure financial 
resources for effective waste management (Zhang et al. 2019). Consistent with earlier studies (Agyemang et al. 
2019; Bhandari et al. 2019), cost- and finance-related factors stand out as the most pertinent barriers to the 
successful implementation of Circular Economy initiatives. Among the financial category’s sub-barriers, the high 
cost of eco-friendly materials’ purchase and packaging acts as a major impediment and carries the topmost 
priority, and the sub-barriers are ranked as FB1 > FB5 > FB3 > FB2 > FB4.  
 
Essential for waste collection and segregation, infrastructure, and technology rely on financial support from both 
public and private entities, a support system that is frequently unavailable (Prakash & Barua, 2015). Another 
significant hurdle ranks as the third major barrier: technical challenges. While technology and innovation are 
crucial for adopting Circular Economy (CE) practices, plastic organizations face obstacles in establishing an 
effective circular model and acquiring the necessary technical expertise to design products with consideration for 
their end-of-life (Sivakumar et al. 2018). Within the plastic industry, the lack of technological advancement is 
attributed to a deficiency in eco-literacy, posing challenges for organizations in developing efficient waste 
management mechanisms and effectively monitoring material flows. The sub-criteria ranking of technical barriers 
is TB4 > TB3 > TB1 > TB5 > TB2, which implies that the lack of availability of resources to implement CSCM 
is the most significant sub-barrier in this category. 
 
To ensure long-term sustainability, any organization must possess adequate resource capabilities (Satapathy, 
2017). In the context of plastic companies, a lack of resource capabilities becomes a hindrance to the recycling 
and reusing of products or materials. This inadequacy in resources stands out as a major obstacle to the 
implementation of Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM) (Gupta & Barua, 2018). Additionally, within this 
category, the absence of a cohesive reverse logistics network for transporting recovered plastic emerges as a 
significant sub-barrier. This finding aligns with the observations made by Sivakumar et al. (2018). Organizational 
barriers’ ranking stands as OB5 > OB1 > OB2 > OB3 > OB4, implying that the very few incentives to promote 
CSCM and inadequate support and commitment from the management rank highest in this category. In response 
to various political, economic, social, and technical changes, coupled with the challenges posed by a competitive 
market, management is compelled to devise policies and strategies aimed at transitioning towards circular business 
practices (Gupta & Barua, 2016; Kumar & Dixit, 2018; Luthra et al. 2016; Prakash & Barua, 2015). Finally, 
market-related barriers’ ranking is MRB2 > MRB5 > MRB3 > MRB4 > MRB1, which depicts that in this category, 
lack of customer awareness about the return of used products is the most critical barrier in the way of implementing 
CSCM. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Organizations are increasingly adopting circular practices in their supply chains, driven by the escalating risks of 
resource scarcity and the imperative to transition to sustainable business models. However, the implementation of 
Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM) in the plastic industry faces significant challenges in developing 
nations like Bangladesh. The complexity of these challenges hinders decision-makers from making effective 
choices, as overcoming multiple barriers simultaneously proves to be a formidable task in practical application. 
 
This study employs a robust Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method to identify and prioritize 24 
barriers categorized under five major groups, as identified through literature review and expert consultations, for 
implementing CSCM in the Bangladeshi plastic industry. The application of the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) methodology produces rankings for the influence of each barrier. The proposed approach is supported by 
an empirical case from a plastics company. The study's results highlight that the most significant barriers to CSCM 
implementation include unsupportive government taxation policies, weak enforcement of rules and regulations, 
high costs associated with the purchase and packaging of eco-friendly materials, and the prevalence of informal

waste collection mechanisms. These findings offer valuable insights for decision-makers and government bodies, 
guiding the formulation of comprehensive and concrete regulations that incentivize organizations to embrace 
CSCM. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the variations in barrier rankings when adjusting 
criteria weights, adding a nuanced understanding of the study's outcomes.

Abstract 
Face recognition technology has gained substantial attention owing to its diverse applications. One of the 
applications includes a face recognition-based attendance system which stands out the most among all the existing 
attendance systems because of its heightened security and time-saving capabilities. A face recognition system is 
the process of recognizing an individual based only on their facial traits. This paper proposes a real-time face 
recognition attendance system that validates the real-time monitoring of the process. OpenCV has been used to 
create a Haar cascade classifier, which is used to recognize faces. The face recognition algorithm Local Binary 
Pattern Histogram (LBPH) has been chosen in this system due to its robustness and better applicability in the real 
world. This proposed method can identify the faces of individuals effectively from various angles. The results 
prove the validation of the work through the monitoring of students' attendance.

Introduction 
The evolution in automation has led to the replacement of traditional attendance systems with Automated 
Attendance systems. Managing attendance records in educational institutions is a crucial factor for evaluating 
student performance. Every educational institution employs its own attendance tracking mechanisms. The 
conventional paper-based attendance management method is deemed inefficient due to the unnecessary 
consumption of a significant amount of lecture hours. Also, the manual attendance system is prone to proxy 
attendance. Moreover, the process of monitoring attendance remains a weighty and inconvenient task for faculty

Table 1 illustrates the confusion matrix for this system. A confusion matrix is a technique for summarizing the 
performance of a classification algorithm. It is used in machine learning and pattern recognition to evaluate the 
performance of a classification algorithm. In the context of face recognition, a confusion matrix helps assess how 
well the system is able to correctly classify individuals into different classes (faces of different people).

The suggested system uses cameras to take snapshots of students present in the classroom on two occasions: 
initially at the start and subsequently at the conclusion of the class. Following this, the system autonomously 
identifies and recognizes students in the images, facilitating the recording of their attendance. The results 
demonstrate the validation of the work through the monitoring of students' attendance. This work involves 
capturing the student's image, face detection through pre-processing, feature extraction, and person recognition. 
In the domain of face recognition, the proposed system employs the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) 
algorithm and the Haar Cascade classifier. The LBP Algorithm utilizes a Histogram, thereby enhancing the 
precision of face recognition. It is seamlessly integrated with the Haar classifier, which harnesses machine learning 
algorithm. The Adaboost Learning algorithm selectively picks small features from extensive sets, thereby 
amplifying the efficiency of the recognition process. The Haar cascade method is chosen for face detection due to 
its robustness, while the LBPH algorithm is employed for face recognition.  
 
Conclusion 
The proposed automated attendance system applies the concept of Haar cascade and local binary pattern histogram 
algorithm for face recognition of students. Acquiring student images from the camera, preprocessing for face 
detection, extracting features, as well as recognizing individuals has offered an effective means for face 
recognition. The automated process not only reduces the workload on faculty members but also enhances the 
efficiency of the attendance tracking system. The findings affirm the validation of the work by monitoring students' 
attendance. The LBPH algorithm has been successfully implied due to its robustness to variations in lighting 
conditions and facial expressions, making it well-suited for real-time face recognition systems. Notably, the 
proposed system operates efficiently without necessitating high-end hardware specifications. This proposed 
system for attendance system allows face recognition in a controlled environment.

Abstract 
Despite water covering 71% of the Earth's surface, only 1% is suitable for drinking, and this limited precious resource 
is dwindling each year. It is a collective responsibility to conserve water and guarantee a steady supply of clean 
drinking water. Household overhead tanks are typically filled by centralized pump units, a situation that often leads 
to overflow if left unattended. This is a widespread problem encountered by numerous homeowners. When a water 
tank runs empty, someone needs to manually regulate the motor. In this paper, a prototype Internet of Things (IOT) 
& GSM-integrated automated system has been developed for monitoring and controlling water pumps. A water level 
sensor is employed to monitor water levels. Users can turn ON the motor pump and check the water level using an 
Android application via IoT whenever water surpasses or falls below a specific level. This way, users, specifically 
farmers from remote areas, can oversee and control all operations conveniently through their mobile devices. The 
system under consideration operates without requiring user intervention unless the water tank is empty. The system 
facilitated by an Arduino Nano enables notifications about the tank's water level and active status to be sent to a 
designated mobile number. This system allows users to decide whether water is required in the tank by responding 
accordingly. The developed system not only conserves electrical power but also prevents artificial flooding, promoting 
a cleaner environment.

Introduction 
A pressing challenge in recent times is the efficient use and management of water resources in the face of global 
concerns. The global scarcity of water has become a major concern, with the water crisis reaching alarming levels 
every day. Given that thirty percent of the world's freshwater is being wasted as groundwater, this issue deserves 
significant attention. In both urban and rural areas, water tank systems are commonly used. However, a noteworthy 
drawback of these systems is the overflow from overhead tanks and water pump overuse which is faced by many 
house owners with overhead tanks. Usually, overhead tanks get filled by centralized pump units, which may overflow 
if unnoticed. A person needs to observe the tank water level manually and operate pumps, i.e., turn ON and off valves 
when the overhead tank has an overflow of water. When a tank is empty, he has to switch ON the motor, and when it 
is full, he has to switch the motor OFF. One has to keep on observing his tank water level to switch off the motor once 
it is switched on. Moreover, sometimes the motor coil burns due to the absence of water in the reserve tank, if 
unnoticed by anyone. To resolve the issue of water shortages in household areas of metro cities, the wastage of water 
during pumping and dispensing into overhead tanks needs to be reduced. As deep underground water accounts for 
30% of the world’s freshwater, its wastage is unacceptable, even after it has successfully been extracted from the 
ground. Such wastage is not just of the water but also of the power used. Water overflowing from overhead (top tank) 
and underground tanks (reserve tank) has become a common scene, even when it leads to the accumulation of water 
in a particular spot, which can be seen as artificial flooding, which is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Therefore,

From this Arduino IoT application, users can visualize the tank’s water level in gauge as well as in percentage, and the 
graph also shows the water scaling parameters. The voltage level of the line can also be shown in the water pump status. 
A system selector can be seen in that panel. Also, whether the water pump is automatically controlled or manually 
controlled, can be visualized as well. The app can also schedule the water pump to fill up the water tank from time to 
time. This can be illustrated from the table 1.

Table 1 demonstrates that activating the ON button in the Arduino IoT cloud application results in the motor being 
switched ON and the water level increasing. The water level sensor not only detects the water level but also signals 
when the water level is low. Similarly, the sensor within the IoT program identifies and displays the medium water 
level, causing the LED on the IoT panel to turn yellow. Activating the button signifies the motor is in the ON state. 
Finally, when the user deactivates the motor through the IoT application and the level sensor identifies a high water 
level, the LCD indicates that the water level is full. 
1. Conclusion 
The developed automated water pump controlling system doesn’t need any attention from the user unless the tank is 
empty. The system includes monitoring of availability of proper electric supply, water level inside the reservoir, water 
scaling, and motor switching status. The system provides a secure water pump controlling system in household sectors 
which is user-friendly, reliable, and easily configurable. This system efficiently controls the water pump by monitoring 
the water level which can work using a wireless network. As the system employs both GSM Module and IoT, users 
will receive water pump status notifications via messages even in the situation of internet connectivity issues. By 
employing this remote monitoring system, several users can simultaneously oversee the same water pump system. 
This functionality empowers the water pump control system to function autonomously, eliminating the need for 
continuous supervision. Users can stay updated on the operational status of the system at any time and from any 
location.

Abstract
As one of the world’s largest and most impactful industries, Ready Made Garments (RMG) sector employs millions 
of people. However, despite its significant workforce contribution, the industry is also known for its poor safety record, 
characterized by frequent accidents and fatalities reported at factories. This research utilizes Interpretive Structural 
Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC techniques to identify twelve critical factors for implementing safety measures in the 
RMG industry. Categorized as independent, linked, autonomous and dependent variables, these factors were analyzed 
for their interrelationships and impact levels. The findings offer valuable insight for policymakers and industry leaders, 
guiding the effective implementation of safety measures in the RMG sector. This research also contributes to ensuring 
workers well-being and promoting sustainable economic growth.

1. Introduction
The rapid growth of industries and businesses has resulted in increased workplace accidents and injuries. Among these 
industries, the ready-made garments (RMG) industry has gained significant attention due to its labour-intensive and 
hazardous working environment. The implementation of effective safety measures is crucial for ensuring the well-
being of workers and possible long-term effects on workers’ health need to be investigated (Hamja et al. 2019). The 
health vulnerabilities of RMG (Ready-Made Garments) workers represent a growing field of investigation that 
requires enhanced comprehension and the identification of solutions (Kabir et al. 2019). While Accord and Alliance 
have improved workplace safety, there's still more to do. The challenge is ensuring a smooth transition of their 
responsibilities to local bodies, requiring transparency, readiness, and strong enforcement (Galib et al. 2019). Ensuring 
a secure and sustainable working environment is crucial for the reputation and stability of the industrial sector,

4. Discussion 
Based on our MICMAC analysis results, it appears that factor 1, ""Government regulations and policies,"" is an 
independent variable, means it has the most influence on the other factors and is not influenced by any other factors. 
Factors 2 to 10, on the other hand, are in the linked variable category, meaning they are both influenced by and have 
an influence on other factors. Finally, factors 11 and 12 are in the dependent variable category, meaning they are 
mostly influenced by the other factors and do not have as much influence on the system. The result of the MICMAC 
diagraph is shown by using the Figure 2.

5. Conclusion 
This study aimed to investigate critical factors for implementing safety measures in the RMG sector using ISM-
MICMAC. The study identified 12 critical factors and analyzed their inter-relationships using the ISM-MICMAC 
approach. The study found that government regulations and policies were the most critical factor, followed by worker 
training, safety culture, and risk assessment. The study's findings have several implications for policymakers and 
industry stakeholders in the RMG sector. The study highlights the importance of developing and enforcing robust 
regulations and policies to improve safety measures in the sector. Additionally, stakeholders should prioritize 
investments in training and development programs for workers and create a safety culture within organizations. Risk 
assessment should also be a priority to identify and mitigate potential hazards in the workplace. The study had several 
limitations, including its focus on the RMG sector in Bangladesh and the reliance on expert opinions. Future research 
could explore the perspectives of workers and other stakeholders in the sector and examine the effectiveness of 
different types of safety measures, such as technology-based solutions. Further research could also explore the impact

Abstract 
In this work, we focus on the application of project management processes to digital marketing platforms. The 
processes we are talking about are mainly oriented toward project charter, content planning, project content 
management, and finally WBS. According to the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) guide, the use 
of WBS (Work Breakdown Structures) is extremely useful for breaking down a project into its constituent parts, 
facilitating evaluation work, ensuring better monitoring of project progress, and checking that final deliverables are in 
line with initial objectives. The key elements of this breakdown can be summarized as follows: (1) We can do 
something after the customer enters his email address ; (2) We can offer a coupon in exchange for an email address ; 
(3) We can do a demo to create a link between what the client wants and how the product can deliver that result ; (4)
We can use the platform to find out whom the visitor is, or what they are interested in, and then direct them to the
funnel that sells that thing ; (5) We can use the application funnel to entice people to buy the most exclusive high-end
products. We can make a demo video of the new product, and then ask customers to join a waiting list for a chance to
buy the product in the future. Finally, (6) we can use the client’s feedback to learn how to better sell the product in the
future.

Abstract
The demand for electric batteries is rising in developing countries like Bangladesh due to the increased demand for 
electric vehicles and energy storage systems. However, electric batteries contain toxic substances such as lead (Pb) 
and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) that are extremely detrimental to the environment. Hence, sustainability is crucial for the 
Electric Battery Industries (EBIs). To make the supply chain circular, it is necessary to identify the underlying 
obstacles to implementing the Circular Supply Chain (CSC). This study aims to explore the barriers to implementing 
CSC in Bangladesh's EBIs. Related barriers were defined using the PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, 
Technological, Environmental and Legal) framework, and the contextual relationship among the identified barriers 
was developed using Interpretive Structural Modelling (MICMAC i.e., Cross Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied 
to Classification technique), followed by a cause-effect analysis of the driving barriers to determine the root causes. 
Lack of sustainable development planning, lack of knowledge about the environment, health, and future generations, 
lack of coordination among industries and supply chain partners, increased competition, lack of investment in 
technological innovation, and low quality of circulated products are the root causes of the driving barriers to 
implementing CSC in Bangladesh's EBIs. Government and supply chain partners in EBIs must employ a 
comprehensive strategy for sustainable development. Implementation of CSC facilitates economic development, 
environmental enhancement, and job creation.

1. Introduction
In previous several years, researchers have emphasized on different aspects of Circular Supply Chain Management 
(CSCM) such as drivers, barriers, practices, models etc. Since drivers and barriers of CSC vary in different context, 
they need to be investigated in the respective cases (Farooque et al. 2019). Now the drivers and barriers have been 
studied in different geographical regions and different industrial setups. For instance, textile industries of Bangladesh 
(Tumpa et al. 2019) and Finland (Flink, 2017), leather industries of Bangladesh (Moktadir, Rahman  et al. 2018), 
Indian context (Mangla et al. 2018), information technologies (IT) and electronic industries of China (Park et al., 
2010), retail industries of Finland (Aminoff and Kettunen 2016),  Indian manufacturing industries (Gupta, Kusi-
Sarpong and Rezaei, 2020), building sector of developing countries (Bilal et al. 2020; Hart et al. 2019) mining sector

1. Introduction
In the current industrial era, there are various types of industrial fields; one of the important industries is the 
manufacturing industry. The manufacturing industry can be in the form of a company or the form of a small and 
medium enterprise. The manufacturing industry has many sectors, so it can make this industry quite promising. These 
sectors include manufacturing in the fields of food, textiles, fashion (clothing), wood products, and many more. 
Small and medium enterprise is a business that has an important role in the economy of Indonesia. Micro, small, and 
medium enterprises themselves are regulated in Law, namely, Law No. 20 of 2008 concerning Micro, Small, and 
Medium Enterprises passed by President Dr. H. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on July 4, 2008. Small and medium 
enterprises in Indonesia itself from time to time have experienced rapid development. Small and medium enterprises 
can play an important role because they can provide access to job opportunities from various sectors. Sectors in small 
and medium enterprise businesses are very varied, both from industry, services, informal sector, and other sectors. 
The small and medium enterprise that I took is a small and medium enterprise engaged in fashion. A small and medium 
enterprise was founded in 2012. This small and medium enterprise produces fashion products such as blouses, games, 
t-shirts, and many more tailored to existing orders.
As we know inventory control must be done so that inventory is not too large so that costs do not become greater, but 
inventory also should not be too little because it can make production which makes goods experience delays in 
reaching consumers, this can make consumers switch to competitors so that it will make losses. The small and medium 
enterprise itself uses the Make to Stock (MTS) system, although this small and medium enterprise has received many 
orders, often because it receives too many orders inventory accumulates and makes production hampered. So, you 
must incur additional costs to store excess inventory. The objective of this paper from small and medium enterprises 
uses a manual method in controlling stock. They do this by using books to write inventory stock in warehouses. This 
small and medium enterprise updates the condition of this stock every day by writing which stocks are increasing and 
decreasing. With this method, often the stock in the warehouse experiences a buildup of goods, so it is necessary to 
plan and forecast and to overcome errors in forecasting, a minimum inventory (safety stock) is made.This research 
will end with a simulation by creating a computer-based program where this program aims to help small and medium 
enterprises facilitate decision-making in the future.

Abstract 
Bamboo has gained prominence in the research community as a sustainable material due to its eco-friendly nature, 
affordability, and rapid growth. Over time, researchers have aimed to enhance bamboo's suitability for construction, 
potentially replacing conventional materials like timber and steel. The solution comes through engineered bamboo, a 
processed form that addresses the challenges of raw bamboo. This innovative approach has sparked interest globally, 
leading to large-scale manufacturing in various countries. The South Asia is the main exporter of engineered bamboo, 
where countries like Bangladesh is far behind. Bangladesh, blessed with a tropical climate, holds immense potential 
to harness the economic and sustainability benefits of mass-producing engineered bamboo. This research studies the 
feasibility of producing engineered bamboo in large scale in place of timber. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis 
unveils a promising prospect: through this initiative, Bangladesh could contribute a substantial 51.5 million USD 
annually to its economy, with potential for growth up to 71 million USD through full production optimization. 
Moreover, this industrialization initiative could markedly reduce 14.8% of the total carbon footprint of Bangladesh.

Introduction 
The anticipated growth and urbanization of the global population in the coming years will lead to a significant need 
for building new homes, buildings, and accompanying infrastructure. Yet, this surge in construction comes at a cost – 
the production of nonrenewable materials like cement and steel produces huge amounts of greenhouse gases 
(Chowdhury et al. 2016; Doan et al. 2017). In the search for sustainable construction materials, researchers have 
identified bamboo as a promising alternative where Bamboo and bamboo-derived panels emerge as the optimal choice 
to meet the construction sector's wood demand. To surmount some of the obstacles of raw bamboo, researchers have 
undertaken a transformative approach by refining bamboo into engineered bamboo, thereby enhancing its structural 
properties and rendering it more amenable to construction applications.

Every metric ton of processed engineered bamboo has the potential to offset approximately 450 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide from the environment (Figure 1(a)). Therefore, an annual output of 28,126 tons of engineered bamboo 
translates to a reduction of approximately 12,657 kilotons of carbon emissions, constituting a substantial 14.8% 
decrease in Bangladesh's overall carbon footprint. 
 
Conclusion 
From this study it is visible that engineered bamboo has a huge opportunity in countries like Bangladesh. This study 
tried to encapsulate the cost-benefit analysis with a view to establishing the feasibility of the production of Engineered 
Bamboo on a large scale in such area. The world market of bamboo is dominated by China and the market of 
engineered bamboo has an immense potential for the likes of countries with available arable land like Bangladesh. 
This study points towards the establishment of large scale engineered bamboo production to facilitate overall economic 
growth as well as a green approach towards sustainable development. It is also notable that engineered bamboo can 
potentially replace timber and also other construction materials in the structural usage due to its extraordinary 
structural properties given its ease of availability. The engineered bamboo industry leaves a negative carbon footprint 
which is an incredibly positive scenario for the global environment along with the country’s atmosphere. In conclusion 
it can be sensibly claimed that the advent of the engineered bamboo industry would provide tremendous benefits to 
Bangladesh and will have its green shadow cast on the environment as well.

Abstract 
The application of a solar chimney is not restricted to electricity generation; it can also be used for building ventilation. 
It plays with a mechanism where solar energy is used to enhance the flow rate from the building. Three different face 
areas (0.56 m2, 1 m2, and 2.25 m2) of solar chimney models are designed and developed in the Mechatronics 
Engineering Laboratory at the World University of Bangladesh. The solar heating system is replaced with an electric 
heating system, and the load is fixed from 1 kW to 2.5 kW, depending on the size of the chimneys. The model chimneys 
are also modified with a wire mesh screen so that the whole solid chimney can be used as a heat source. About 100 
sets of experiments were carried out in the modified and traditional chimneys under different solid chimney heights 
and heat loads. The solid chimney heights are maintained from 0.30 m to 1.20 m with an increment of 0.30 m. The 
experimental results show that the volumetric flow rate varies from 0.005 m3/s to 0.014 m3/s depending on the heat 
load, solid chimney height, and face areas. The minimum volumetric flow rate of 0.005 m3/s was observed in the 
traditional chimney, whereas the maximum volumetric flow rate was 0.014 m3/s in the modified chimney. 
Furthermore, the modified chimney also exhibits a higher exit air temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 
presence of wire mesh in the chimney enhances the flow rate (volumetric), which is approximately 50 to 80 percent 
higher than the flow rate in the traditional chimney.

Introduction 
The energy demand serves as a key indicator for assessing the social, structural, and technical progress of a nation. 
Conventional energy sources, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, are deemed essential for the contemporary 
global economy. Throughout history, traditional energy sources have played a crucial role in fostering economic 
growth. Given the constraints associated with conventional energy supplies, there is currently a reassessment of their 
use and a search for alternative solutions for development. Consequently, an increasing number of individuals are 
seeking ""renewable energy sources"" as alternatives to traditional energy sources. According to Ostergaard et al. 
(2020), Zobaa & Bansal (2011), and Gross et al. (2003), renewable energy comes from inexhaustible sources. 
Throughout the entirety of human existence, individuals have utilized renewable energy sources. It is considered the 
key energy source for sustaining human life. Upon the initial utilization of fire by mankind, they became the pioneers 
in harnessing renewable energy. Around 5,500 years ago, wind power powered sail ships. Currently, wind energy is 
harnessed to generate electrical power. Renewable energy sources are extensively employed, and numerous 
governments are endeavoring to replicate this practice across various regions of the globe. When it comes to delivering

hence improving the rate of air flow or ventilation. The model study demonstrated a ventilation improvement of over 
90 percent when wire mesh screens were inserted in the solid chimney model, and a ventilation improvement of around 
300 percent compared to a solid wall chimney. 
 
Conclusions 
A chimney model is tested with and without a solid-walled chimney under different heat loads. The model is also 
tested with and without a wire mesh screen. The maximum draft loss is observed at the model chimney when there is 
no solid wall chimney or wire mesh screen. In this condition, the air flow rate is also found to be very low compared 
to other conditions. Although the solid wall chimney enhanced the air flow rate significantly, the maximum air flow 
rate was observed when the model was introduced with a solid wall chimney and wire mesh screen. The outcome of 
the model indicates that the solar chimney with a mesh screen and a solid wall chimney has significantly enhanced 
the flow rate.

Abstract 
One typical passive ventilation arrangement is solar chimney-assisted ventilation. When a solar chimney is used on 
its own, there is very little potential benefit. Solar chimneys are therefore always used in integrated setups. The 
determination of this investigation is to examine ventilation performance through the integration of a turbine ventilator 
and a solar chimney. To facilitate its integration with the turbine ventilator, a small solar chimney is suggested. By 
heating a solar chimney at a constant heat flux, its performance is investigated experimentally. Larger air gaps and 
higher inclination angles were shown to yield better results. However, after the ideal values of air gap depth and 
inclination angle, the performance begins to decline. It is advised that the input aperture area be as a minimum twice 
as big as the outlet aperture area, even if there is no particular relationship between the two. Through constant heat 
flux heating of the solar chimney and/or constant rotational speed of the turbine ventilator, we conduct experimental 
studies of the combined arrangement for ventilation. The findings show that the solar chimney with a revolving turbine 
ventilator has the optimum ventilation performance. The suggested solar chimney also demonstrates the potential to 
experience the flow reversal effect because it operates better without wire mesh than it does with it. All of those 
findings will be helpful in the construction of solar chimneys in the future, either for prediction or designation, in 
order to meet the ventilation demand.

Introduction 
As the solar system's center, the sun produces a significant quantity of energy each day. The energy that the sun emits 
and transfers to Earth is around two billionths of its total energy. The enormous amount of energy present on Earth 
might be its primary source, providing more than enough energy to meet all of the world's energy needs (Robert, 
2006)[1]. Since solar energy is a viable, dependable backup energy source, it has tremendous value and a bright future 
(Mekhilef et al. 2012)[2]. Photovoltaic cells, solar concentrators, solar chimneys, solar air warmers, and solar dryers 
are a few examples of solar energy harvesting devices (Quesada et al. 2012; Zhai et al. 2011;).[3], [4] 
Alternatively, result of population enhancement and changes in standards of living, energy consumption in the 
building industry is dramatically increasing. Furthermore, non-renewable energy resources account for the majority 
of energy production. Solar and passive systems have attracted a lot of interest and research due to factors such as 
rising costs, energy supply security, and environmental concerns (Li et al. 2014).[5]

One of the conclusions drawn from these three data is that incorporating wire mesh into the combination consistently 
results in worse performance compared to the same combination without wire mesh. This demonstrates that the wire 
mesh cannot improve the chimney's functionality. Althoug, Chu et al. (2012)[17], and Chu et al. (2014)[17] claim that 
the screen mesh enhanced the solar chimney performance by reducing draft losses. This effect was not observed in 
this research. This is because of the shape of the chimney. Chu et al. used a circular and square-shaped chimney, 
whereas in the experiment, a square convergent duct was used as a chimney model. In this case, the wire mesh adds

extra resistance to a flow's route since there is no flow reversal, which lowers the heat load and draft. Thus, it is 
demonstrated that there is a chance that the suggested solar chimney design will experience the flow reversal effect. 
 
 
Despite the benefits of combining the turbine ventilator and solar chimney, there is one issue with the integration. In 
addition to being less effective than the identical combination with a revolving turbine ventilator, the combination 
with a static turbine ventilator performs worse than the combination without a turbine ventilator. This is consistent 
with the earlier research's discovery that the airflow is being obstructed by the static turbine ventilator (Lai, 2003)[18]. 
Therefore, if the turbine ventilator is included in the integrated system, a static turbine ventilator may cause issues. 
 
Conclusion  
Based on the findings obtained, there is no doubt in concluding that the combination without wire mesh and with a 
rotating turbine ventilator is going to perform the best. However, the enhancement of turbine ventilators from other 
sources is necessary to solve the problem of static turbine ventilators.

Abstract 
The energy demand is increasing day by day and putting pressure on traditional energy sources, which allows 
researchers to work on alternative energy sources. Traditional energy sources and conversion technology are also 
under threat due to their environmental impact. One kind of environmentally friendly technology that generates power 
from vortexes created by gravity pulls is the gravitational water vortex power plant. Because of its favorable effects 
on the environment and low hydraulic head need, this kind of power plant is desirable. However, a lack of literature 
and exposure held back the development of this technique. This study focuses on how the geometry of the penstock 
affects the power plant's efficiency. We developed an experimental configuration that resembles the low-head river 
and power plant. Experiments revealed that an increase in the feeding breadth of the penstock decreased the power 
plant's efficiency. It was also discovered that the power plant's efficiency was mostly unaffected by the model's length 
for the penstock. The power plant's efficiency was determined to be at its peak when the ratio of the basin's diameter 
to the outflow diameter was within the range of 0.16 and 0.18. Ultimately, the power plant's performance was 
determined to be enhanced by raising the inlet flow rate by the researchers. These results suggested that additional 
research on this technology is required to fully use low-head sites.

Introduction 
To work on an object, one needs to use a property called energy. Energy can be transformed, but it cannot be created 
or destroyed, according to the rule of conservation of energy. There is a vast array of different forms that energy can 
take. Converting energy sources into electrical energy, or electricity, is one of the most popular energy 
transformations. The overall amount of energy consumed increased from about 8,991 Mtoe (million tons of oil 
equivalent) in 1990 to over 13,903 Mtoe in 2016, according to Global Energy Statistics (2017). The fact that the 
sources of this increase are primarily limited energy sources—oil, coal, gas, biomass, electricity, and heat—makes 
them concerning. The rising demand for electrical energy makes the growth in consumption inevitable as well. Finding 
a sustainable energy source is currently imperative (Krozer Y. 2013; Alrikabi N. 2014). As a result, many nations 
concentrate their attention on the potential for producing electricity using renewable energies, as they have limitless 
sources, don't release carbon dioxide that would be harmful to the environment, and—most importantly—have far 
lower total prices than finite energy supplies. According to Global Energy Statistics (2017), Norway topped the list 
with 97.9% of power produced in 2016 from renewable energy sources. Other nations were also represented on the 
list. Additionally, more than 80% of the electricity produced in Brazil, Colombia, and New Zealand comes from 
renewable energy sources, namely hydropower, solar power, and wind. China, which has been among the biggest

Figure 7.  Efficiency of the GWVPP for different flow rates 
 
With Penstock D and the outlet's diameter of 72 mm fitted with an input flow rate of 8.8 m3/hr, the tested power plant 
achieved the maximum efficiency among the five flow rates. Up to 28.29% efficiency was recorded. On the other 
hand, when Penstock C was put in conjunction with an outlet that had a 64 mm diameter and an inlet flow rate of 5.6 
m3/hr, efficiency as low as 2.3% was noted. It was found that installing Penstocks A, D, and E beside outputs with a 
diameter of 64 and 72 mm often yields the maximum efficiency for each flow rate. Conversely, it was discovered that 
Penstock C and outputs with 64 mm and 52 mm dimensions were responsible for the built power plant's low efficiency 
at all measured flow rates. It was discovered that, among the six penstock models, an incoming flow rate of 5.6 m3/hr 
was always present in conjunction with the low efficiency of the constructed power plant, regardless of the penstocks. 
The power plant recorded decreased efficiency at most setups due to the inlet flow rate of 5.6 m3/hr when compared 
to other flow rates at comparable setups. This was particularly true when a 64mm-diameter exit was used with a 5.6 
m3/hr intake flow rate.  
 
Conclusion 
Five different entrance flow rates were assessed on the laboratory-sized GWVPP with different penstock geometry 
and outlets connected. It was found that the GWVPP's efficiency will increase when the inlet flow rate is raised from 
5.6 m3/hr to 8.8 m3/hr. Other than that, several hypotheses led to the conclusion that the GWVPP efficiency was barely 
affected by penstock models A, D, E, and F. More experiments were needed to validate the hypotheses. Conversely, 
it has been discovered that Penstock Models B and C, with their larger feeding widths, lower the GWVPP efficiency. 
The optimal diameter range for the prototype was found to be 64–72 mm at intake flow rates of 8.8–8.0 m3/hr. The 
maximum efficiency of 28.29% was attained with an output diameter of 72 mm and a penstock model D running at a 
flow rate of 8.8 m3/h. In conclusion, Mulligan and Hull (2010) advise that the output diameter be maintained at a ratio 
of 0.14 to 0.18 in the GWVPP design, but the feeding width for the penstock should be reduced. Furthermore, the 
inflow flow rate must be as high as practical given availability.

Abstract 
Wire EDM is a specialized thermal machining method that uses a thin wire electrode to cut conductive materials 
with high precision, including complicated shapes and sharp edges. The investigation uses a CNC Wire EDM 
machine with a molybdenum wire electrode and an AISI 4140 steel workpiece. The aim was to achieve superior 
surface finish and dimensional accuracy for spur gears. Control parameters like current, Pulse on (T-on) time, and 
pulse off (T-off) time were chosen to experiment with the performance measure in terms of surface roughness. 9 
experimental runs (L9 OA) were conducted in total, using an orthogonal array, and for the Surface Roughness, 
the appropriate combination of control factor levels was identified. The Minitab-18 program is used to apply the 
Taguchi method to determine the level of importance and optimum machining parameters. The findings offer 
valuable insights for manufacturers to enhance product quality and optimize manufacturing processes.

1. Introduction
The practical application of Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) relies on the established phenomenon 
of conventional EDM sparking, which employs a non-contact method of material removal. Since its inception, 
WEDM has progressed from a simple technique for creating tools and dies to the preferred form for producing 
highly accurate micro-scale parts with exceptional surface finish quality. Patel and Vaghmare assert the extensive 
utilization of WEDM across industries, including aerospace, medical, automotive, and electronics (Patel & 
Vaghmare 2013). Spur gears are widely employed in mechanical systems due to their unique capabilities and 
advantages. The manufacturing process of spur gears ensures the desired dimensional accuracy and surface finish. 
Since wire EDM can cut spur gears to high-quality standards, it is frequently used as one of the possible 
manufacturing techniques. A study conducted by Chaubey and Jain demonstrated the use of wire EDM to create 
meso and micro gears using a tiny wire formed of an electrically conducting substance. Wire EDM gives 
remarkably high precision and accuracy while being a relatively slow technique (Chaubey & Jain  2018). 
Additionally, wire EDM can cut intricate forms and rigid materials, making it appropriate for manufacturing spur 
gears. Spur gear must, therefore, be manufactured carefully to guarantee their usability and dependability in 
mechanical systems. 
In recent years, an increased focus on WEDM process parameter optimization to improve performance metrics 
has emerged. El-taweel and Hewidy examined and assessed the parameters for wire-cut EDM machining of CK45 
steel to measure process performance indicators such as the material removal rate, tool wear, and surface 
roughness (El‐taweel & Hewidy 2013). Similar studies have been conducted by Alias et al. on the impact of 
parameter changes on the machining of titanium Ti-Al-4V using wire EDM and the Taguchi method (Alias et al. 
2012). These studies show how significantly better WEDM process parameter performance may be achieved 
through optimization approaches. 
The process parameters, such as pulse on-time, pulse off-time, peak current, and wire feed rate, significantly 
influence the final components' machining performance and quality. The required precision, surface roughness, 
and material removal rate can only be attained by optimizing these parameters. Ehsan Asgar and Singh Singholi 
have used various optimization techniques, including the Taguchi method, grey relational analysis, and response 
surface methodology, to achieve this. The Taguchi approach stands out among these methods for its ease of use 
and potency in determining the ideal arrangement of process parameters (Ehsan Asgar & Singh Singholi  2018).

4. Conclusion 
The operation of a better gear needs to have a surface roughness that is lower than average since this reduces 
friction and wear. The following findings were reached from this work based on the Results and Discussion, and 
a trial was set up to figure out the various machining parameters on Wire Electrical Discharge. For performance 
measurements supported by Taguchi's optimization process, machining used molybdenum wire 0.25 mm in 
diameter. The optimized input parameter combinations to encourage minimal Surface Roughness are Pulse on 70 
µs, Pulse off 7 µs, and Current 9 amps. Increased mechanical performance is a direct result of the decreased 
surface roughness and improved microstructural properties. In fabricating spur gears, combining the Taguchi 
method with SEM analysis has proven to be an effective strategy for optimizing the Wire EDM process 
parameters. This was achieved through the integration of both approaches. Additional studies could investigate 
the effect of various materials and intricate geometries on the Wire EDM manufacturing process and the resulting 
microstructure.

Abstract 
Natural fibers are a more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective alternative to synthetic fibers. Hybrid composites 
made from both natural and synthetic fibers have gained popularity due to improved mechanical properties and cost-
effectiveness. In this study, we have investigated the mechanical behavior of flax/glass/epoxy and flax/bamboo/epoxy 
hybrid composites under tensile load utilizing Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software ABAQUS. Flax/bamboo/epoxy 
hybrid composites were compared to flax/glass/epoxy composites using FEA software to evaluate their layup 
configurations. The result reveals that flax/bamboo/epoxy composite deforms less than flax/glass/epoxy composite for 
the same layup patterns and force applied. The maximum modulus of elasticity of flax/bamboo/epoxy was found 8485.80 
MPa which is better compared to the flax/glass/epoxy composite. So, it is possible to use flax, bamboo, and epoxy 
composites as a more affordable and eco-friendly option instead of flax, glass, and epoxy composites. The use of 
flax/bamboo/epoxy composites is a viable option in manufacturing various automotive parts like door panels, instrument 
panels, armrests, headrests, and seat shells.

1. Introduction
Researchers are exploring the use of natural fibers as an alternative to synthetic ones, which are harmful to the 
environment and non-biodegradable. Research on designing new materials for future industries focuses on environmental 
sustainability and economic issues. Several research (Asif et al.2020, Islam et al. 2019, Jubair et al. 2021) have been 
conducted on the potential use of natural fiber-reinforced epoxy composite to be used in construction. Chakrabarti et al. 
(2020) studied the effect of chemical treatment on the mechanical properties of luffa fiber-reinforced epoxy composites 
and found that after NaOH treatment, the tensile and flexural properties have been improved. Belal et al. (2023) 
numerically investigated the potential of replacing glass fiber with Bamboo fiber in Flax/Glass hybrid composite under 
bending load and found that the Glass fiber can be replaced by Bamboo fiber for the composite in bending. Bamboo and 
flax have the potential to replace synthetic fibers in composites. Flax fiber-reinforced composites have potential 
applications in sports, maritime, automotive, and aeronautical industries (Moudood et al. 2019). The renewability and 
rapid growth of bamboo have led to an upsurge in research on bamboo-based products in industries such as housing, 
furniture, packaging, and transportation (Khalil et al.2012). The hybrid composite made of flax and bamboo has great 
potential. Xu et al. (2019) analyzed the mechanical properties of four composite materials using both analytical and 
numerical modeling to validate experimental results obtained from tensile tests.  
The hybrid composite reinforced with flax and glass fibers exhibited the highest elastic modulus and tensile strength. 
Cebru & Botis (2017) conducted a numerical investigation of the bending behavior of glass/flax/epoxy and then 
flax/epoxy hybrid composites. The results showed that glass/flax/epoxy hybrid composites had a greater modulus of 
elasticity values than flax/epoxy composites. Gu et al. (2018) investigated the viability of substituting bamboo fibers for 
flax fibers in thermoplastic (polypropylene) reinforcements in terms of mechanical and environmental performance. The 
bamboo fiber-reinforced composites performed better in environmental performance and the flax fiber-reinforced 
composites showed better mechanical performance. Khan et al. (2017) performed both experimental and numerical 
investigations on fracture behavior of bamboo/epoxy fiber-reinforced composites. Experimental data showed that 25 mm 
length of fibers had the highest fracture toughness value and 10 mm length fibers had the lowest fracture toughness value. 
The FEA model using ABAQUS software matched the experimental study.

laminate theory, the modulus of all the flax/bamboo/epoxy hybrid composites should be same as they all have same 
volume fraction (Karimzadeh et al., 2020). However, according to our findings, if the layers are oriented like a sandwich 
structure then the modulus of elasticity also increases provided that all the models have the same number of layers and 
same fiber volume fraction i.e. everything is the same except the lay-up sequence.

5.0 Conclusions 
The key findings of this research can be summarized as- 
• 
Maximum deformation is reduced by 20.08% and modulus of elasticity is increased by 24.73% for Models FB-1 and 
FB-2 which suggests that if the hybrid composite is designed like a sandwich structure then the structural stiffness as 
well as modulus of elasticity are increased. 
• 
The maximum von-Mises stress and maximum principal stress for Flax/Bamboo fiber reinforced hybrid composite 
is higher compared to Flax/Glass fiber reinforced composite which is due to the stiffness of the Bamboo fiber. 
However, minimum increase is observed for Models FB-1 and FB-2. 
• 
Bamboo fiber has the potential of replacing glass fiber as all the hybrid composites with bamboo fibers exhibit better 
mechanical properties in tensile test.

Abstract 
This study focused on the development of thermal insulation boards by utilizing expanded perlite (EP) and expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) within a lightweight core, in conjunction with a Formica sheet serving as the exterior layer. The 
sandwich specimens were fabricated by employing epoxy resin as a binding material, with the volume fractions of EP 
and EPS being adjusted. A detailed assessment was undertaken to evaluate the physical, mechanical, and thermal 
conductivity via Lee's disc method. The core's flexural strength, modulus, and energy absorption were found to be 
superior when the EP volume fraction within it was at its ideal level of 100%. As predicted, there was a positive 
correlation between the thermal conductivity and the proportion of EP particles. Significantly greater swelling and 
water absorption were seen in sandwiches composed of 100% EP compared to those composed of 100% EPS. The 
introduction of EP particles into EPS resulted in a reduction in facial wrinkling during flexural failure, as well as an 
enhancement in deboning and skin delamination. This research study presents significant findings on the behavior of 
composite materials, which has the potential to contribute to the advancement of thermal insulation technology.

1. Introduction
 A sandwich composite structure is a three-layered panel comprising three unique layers: an outside layer, a core, and 
an interior layer, each serving a specialized purpose in providing thermal insulation, high load capacity, and relatively 
high compressive and flexural strength and stiffness. These sandwich boards promote energy efficiency, maintain 
temperature control, and improve a structure's comfort and energy performance. The middle layer is the principal 
component for providing different thermal and mechanical properties. The materials commonly utilized in this layer 
are expanded polystyrene (EPS), expanded perlite (EP), extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane foam, fiberglass, 
mineral wool, foam board, etc. 
 Polystyrene (PS) is one of the general-purpose plastics with a wide variety of applications due to its good mechanical 
properties, anti-corrosion capacity, and processing performance (Zhao Z et al. 2020). However, it generates a lot of 
waste, as it is used in low-cost articles with very short use time. One way to reuse them is using them as composite 
materials. Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) is a lightweight, thermoplastic foam with insulation and durability 
characteristics. Investigated the mechanical behavior of EPS sandwich composites with varying fabric reinforcements

percentage of 100 percent, the highest values of flexural strength, modulus, and energy absorption were 
discovered. The 100% EP-based sandwich outperformed the 100% EPS-based sandwich in terms of flexural 
strength, modulus, and energy absorption by 5.47, 6, and 2.59 times, respectively. The table demonstrates that 
more perlite may be added to EPS to improve its mechanical characteristics, such as strength, modulus, and energy 
absorption. As a consequence, the mechanical characteristics of EPS may be optimized. However, the mechanical 
characteristics of EPS increased when the volume of perlite in the samples was increased to 25%. 
 
The flexural failure characteristics of five different sandwich boards, each made up of different ratios of expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) and expanded polyurethane (EP) materials, are shown in Figure 3(b). Skin wrinkling was the 
most common failure mode seen in cases where the insulating core was entirely made of EPS. Core shear failure 
became the major failure mode at the 50% EPS composition as the fraction of EP in the core increased, 
accompanied by a decrease in EPS content. Notably, the failure mode changed to skin delamination at an EP level 
of 75%, which worsened as the EP value reached 100%. 
 
In general, perlite has a much higher thermal conductivity than EPS, hence the thermal conductivity of the sample 
increases as the perlite content does as well. As may be stated, the thermal conductivity of 100 percent EPS was 
discovered to be 0.037 W/ (m - k). Similarly, the thermal conductivity rose with the addition of perlite, as the 
sample with 100 percent perlite had a thermal conductivity of 0.050 W / (m - k). Therefore, more perlite may 
be added to EPS to improve its mechanical and thermal characteristics. The mechanical and thermal performance 
of EPS will be significantly improved as a consequence, and an ideal lightweight composite material may be 
created. 
 
4. Conclusion  
In this work, lightweight sandwich structures were fabricated using expanded perlite and expanded polystyrene beads 
with varying proportions. The density, swelling thickness percentage, static flexural strength and modulus, energy 
absorption, failure behavior, and thermal conductivity of the composite structures were investigated. The findings of 
the study are summarized as follows: 
• 
The density of the sandwich structure has a proportional relation with the EP particles in the sandwich core 
due to the higher density of EP particles. 
• 
Due to higher EP content, it was found that the swelling and water absorption grew higher than that of EPS. 
The capacity to retain screws perpendicularly and to hold screws in parallel was observed to be lower for the 
100% EPS specimen than that of 100% EP. 
• 
It was found from the flexural tests that as the EP percentage in the sandwich structures increased, the flexural 
strength, modulus, and energy absorption increased. With the blending of EP and EPS, cracking and deboning 
were increased in the specimens. 
• 
The long plateau after the peak in the stress-strain curves indicated the high energy absorption capability of 
the developed sandwich structures. 
• 
The flexural properties of sandwich panels including strength, modulus, and energy absorption along with 
thermal conductivity were significantly affected by the replacement of EPS particles with EP particles. 
However, the combination of 25%EP particles with 75% EPS particles proved to be an optimum mixer for 
the improvement in the mechanical characteristics. 
• 
The mixer of EP and EPS to manufacture lightweight sandwich structures showed a positive effect in terms 
of flexural and thermal insulation properties.

Abstract 
House rent is a crucial factor in any country’s socio-economic scenario. This can act as an indicator of the financial 
and developmental situations of the stakeholders of the real estate business. So far, there have been approaches to 
predict house rent prices in several regions of Bangladesh, but without any clear explanation of the association of 
different factors to the prediction and how they are affecting the prices. This study touches on this lack of 
understanding and proposes an Explainable AI based framework. This framework produces accurate predictions on 
house rents with small margin of error with regression algorithm and can accurately depict the connection of various 
demographic features of the dataset by visualizing SHAP values. Our study finds that tree-based algorithms such as 
Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boost and Light Gradient Boost performed better at regression 
analysis on the nonlinear dataset of ours. The final model was a voting ensemble of all the tree-based algorithms, 
which encompasses the strengths of all the base models. We achieved an MAPE of 11% and R2 Score of 86%. The 
RMSE and MAE of the ensemble were 4398.23 and 2536.77 respectively. Finally, the SHAP Explainable AI 
determined how the features were correlated to the prediction and overall rent prices. The research introduces a novel 
framework for predicting house rents in Bangladesh, offering valuable insights through data preparation, model 
selection, performance assessments, and interpretability analyses, benefiting both scholars and stakeholders.

1. Introduction
The current urban population of Bangladesh is estimated to be around 38% to 40%, and projections indicate that this 
figure will increase to at least 48% by the year 2030 (Hasina 2019). The urban real estate market experiences 
significant pressure, with a special focus on the rental housing sector. The situation in Dhaka, the capital city of 
Bangladesh, has been worse by unplanned urbanization and inadequate infrastructure. Given the limited availability 
of adequate housing options, the current task of finding an affordably priced rental house that meets the desired criteria 
is particularly arduous. Furthermore, the cost of renting an apartment is subject to fluctuation due to a multitude of 
factors, including but not limited to the quantity of bedrooms and baths, the overall size of the unit, its geographical 
placement, and other relevant considerations. According to a study, this further complicates the procedure (Begum 
2007).

5.4 SHAP Analysis 
The SHAP summary plot shows how each feature is connected to the prediction models. For the feature “Area”, we 
can see that the feature value gets high when SHAP value is increasing. It means, the larger the apartment area, the 
higher the rent. It is true for real life applications. For “Location” feature, we see that both high and low values are 
overlapping. It means that apartments of both high and low values are in the same location. Increasing of bath and 
bed also increases the apartment fare, but their impact to the prediction is low. “Area” and “Location” are the main 
features while predicting house rent. 
 
 
Figure 6. SHAP Summary Plot of the Dataset 
To check how accurate our model is, we also viewed the SHAP force plot on single instance predictions. The voting 
regressor was used for creating SHAP values of force plot. Let’s take a point, 3000. For the 3000th point, the predicted 
value is 18892.56 while the actual value is 16500. It shows how close the prediction is done by voting regressor. And 
the value is so close to the base value (19400). For the fare prediction, we see that the location and area of apartment 
is lowering the rent while amount of bed and bath in that apartment is pushing it higher. 
 
Figure 7. SHAP Force Plot for Point 3000 
For another point, let’s say 634, we see that the predicted value is 14876 while actual value in the dataset is 15500. It 
shows the predicted value is almost close to the actual value. Low fare is predicted according to the area and bath 
while location and bed was pushing the fare high.

6. Conclusion 
In this article, a novel way to predict flat rent in Dhaka city is presented. This approach makes use of a comprehensive 
strategy that employs twelve different machine learning algorithms. The results reveal that the overall performance is 
solid, with the Voting Regressor Ensemble Model emerging as the most effective predictor. The significance of 
ensemble models in improving accuracy for real-world applications in the dynamic area of rent prediction is 
highlighted by this realization. Also, the black box nature of the models was interpreted here.

6.1 Proposed Improvement 
Our algorithms performed exceptionally well. The ensemble model had a MAPE of 11%, lower than earlier research. 
We improved the existing works as follows: 
1. No previous research has been done on the transparency of predicting apartment rent prices in Bangladesh. 
The recommended enhancement emphasizes the study's unique contribution. The study's distinctiveness and 
originality make it a local pioneering endeavor. 
2. The proposal implies that real estate brokers and homeowners can benefit from the study. The analysis can 
help real estate decision-makers by projecting Dhaka City flat rents. This implies that the study has practical 
applications beyond academic curiosity. 
3. The proposal offers a comparison analysis with research or works that have been undertaken in the same field 
in the past. From the previous works, we have discovered a great deal of room for development. First and 
foremost, we made use of the Voting Regressor ensemble model on the tree-based algorithms, which 
produced the most favorable results. 
4. SHAP explainable AI made it possible to easily understand our findings and making it clear to all the 
stakeholders of the Bangladesh real estate community. 
6.2 Future Research 
Inherent to any research endeavor, it is imperative to acknowledge the limitations that may influence the scope, 
generalizability, and precision of the study. This section delineates key constraints encountered during the exploration 
of the study, shedding light on areas where the study may be refined or extended for future investigations: 
1. Since the dataset does not contain comprehensive data on all components of a property, it leaves out important 
details, which restricts the level of depth that can be achieved in the research. 
2. The study does not include any data from regions that have populations that are greater than one lakh, which 
may cause it to overlook significant patterns or variations in flat rents in regions that have a high population 
density. 
3. The dataset used in the research is from 2022, which influences the accuracy of the model as well as its 
relevance to the dynamics of the current market. This is because the real estate and rental markets are both 
continuously evolving. 
Although there were limitations, this study conducted a comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms 
for estimating the monthly rental prices of flats in Dhaka city.  By making suitable adjustments, it may be implemented 
on online flat rental search engines to assist users in seeking and forecasting flat rents in various locations of Dhaka 
city.

Abstract 
The mineral industry plays a pivotal role in the economic development of nations, and as sustainability becomes 
increasingly critical, the need to prioritize sustainable practices within this sector becomes paramount. This paper 
explores the imperative of identifying and prioritizing sustainable indicators tailored to the unique context of the 
mineral industry in Pakistan. Pakistan have huge mineral potential and is amongst the global mineral rich nations, so 
far more than 92 minerals have been explored. The main resources includes billion tons of coal, copper, gypsum, 
granite, gold, and iron, these are estimated to be 186, 6.72, 4.85, 4.414, 1.85, and iron 1.43, respectively(Shah, 2018). 
The average annual growth rate of the industry and its contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) is about 3% 
which is not proportionate to its capacity. Despite these mineral potentials, one cannot disagree with the risks of 
mineral extractions. Both surface as well as underground mines are present in Pakistan and is functioning with outdated 
practices and old mining laws (Jiskani et.al, 2020). This study will also address the risk factors pertaining to issues of 
organization in implementing the sustainability in mining sector. The case study result will open an avenue for 
practitioners and decision-makers of Pakistan to understand sustainability implication in mining sector. Overall, this 
study will be a contribution in making a Policy framework for mining industry of Pakistan, which is a major 
contribution.

1. Introduction
Mining is considered as one of the main driving business across the globe. According to the International Council of 
Mining and Metals (ICMM), nearly 70 countries are primarily dependent on the mining industry; most of those 
countries are low income developing countries. The mineral industry plays a pivotal role in the economic landscape 
of Pakistan, contributing significantly to the country's GDP and employment. However, the pursuit of mineral 
resources often raises environmental and social concerns, necessitating a paradigm shift towards sustainable practices. 
In this context, prioritizing sustainable indicators for the mineral industry of Pakistan becomes imperative. This 
approach seeks to strike a balance between economic development and environmental stewardship, acknowledging 
the finite nature of mineral resources and the need for responsible exploitation. By focusing on sustainable indicators, 
Pakistan can not only enhance the long-term viability of its mineral sector but also foster environmental conservation, 
social equity, and community well-being. This introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the 
sustainable dimensions that should be prioritized in shaping the future trajectory of the mineral industry in Pakistan. 
Though mining sector have major role in the economic development of any country, however, due to inadequate 
policies, measures, outdated mining laws and socio-political influence, mining sector of Pakistan cannot contribute 
substantially to GDP of Pakistan. Pakistan, being a developing country, has been facing number of social as well as

6. Conclusion 
Mining and mineral industry is growing at fast due to increasing demand in global mineral supply chain. On the 
contrary, developing countries are facing multiple challenges pertaining to mining which are posing threats to 
environment, economic and communities. These sustainability challenges must be addressed with some minor changes 
in their policies, initiative programs, research in sustainability must be part of government framework. This study has 
focused the mineral industry of Pakistan. Screening of more than 50 research articles identified various number of 
main indicators and sub-indicators related to environmental sustainability, social sustainability and economic 
sustainability that specifically associated with sustainable mining. Five main indicators with 33 sub indicators for 
environmental sustainability were finalized. Four main indicators with 19 sub indicators for social sustainability and 
at last three major indicator with 18 sub indicators for economic sustainability were categorized. These indicators and 
sub indicators were finalized in light of emerging challenges in mineral industry of Pakistan. Moreover, it was also 
observed that further study must be conducted to see the relationship between these sub indicators for proper 
implication of these parameters in formulating sustainable mineral policy and industry.

Abstract 
 
The sustainable business of a perishable product (i.e. vegetables) concerns primarily on the assurance of freshness and 
quality, while simultaneously minimizing waste and dealing with economic impact. Approximately 31.5% of 
vegetable and fruit production is subjected to waste throughout the supply chain (SC) process. To address this issue, 
this study takes advantage of a Simulation-Based Decision-Making Framework, leveraging the Digital Supply Chain 
Twin paradigm to deal with the urgent challenges faced by the perishable goods supply chain in Bangladesh. 
Computational simulations were employed to model the perishable products i.e. vegetable supply chain, enabling the 
identification of integrated nodes and the optimization of routes between them. However, the research lacks sufficient 
data for running the actual model simulation. In this paper, we offer a generalized decision-making framework for 
using digital twins in SC as well as delineate how digital twins can contribute to waste reduction in SC along with 
making it further resilient. Utilizing the framework, organizations can monitor the need for replenishment based on 
the shelf life of certain produce, and make decisive actions from the optimized routing system in real time. Also, they 
can make predictions of potential disruptions that might lead to food loss such as demand forecasting inaccuracy, 
insufficient inventory management, transportation issues etc. Through the exhibition of a decrease in waste, 
improvement in quality, and enhanced contingency measurements, the research findings underscore the importance 
of data availability between the nodes to implement the SC digital twin to support an effective and sustainable supply 
chain of perishable goods.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 outbreak has brought about major health crises globally and the persistent nature of long COVID has 
put a significant strain on hospitals as a result of scarce healthcare resources. Heart problems are discovered to be the 
most prevalent among persons who have recovered from COVID-19 among several long-lasting effects (Gupta et al., 
2021). There are so many cases of what is generally occurring with post-COVID patients. This work tries to find out 
the proper machine learning methods to predict the post-COVID complexities which can provide the highest accuracy. 
The true objective of this endeavor is to conduct additional machine learning-based research in this area of medical 
science and to develop an accurate machine-learning model. In the case of COVID patients, there are a lot of outcomes 
in a post-COVID condition. Proper problem definition, data acquisition, Model selection, evaluation of training and 
testing models, etc., are also significant obstacles to constructing a decent prediction model. There were proposed 
machine learning models according to previous research which model is combined with multiple models. This research 
might contribute to making further approaches to predicting the complexities of other diseases like COVID-19.

1. Introduction
The SARS-COV-2 is the virus which makes the illness (Covid-19) condition of coronavirus. The majority of infected 
individuals will only develop mild to moderate respiratory infections and recover on their own, with the exception of a 
small number of people who will require medical care (WHO  2021). So many positive cases were coming since 2019 
and people are suffering from this virus. However, A large number of vaccination led to a decline in several COVID-
19   cases. Post-COVID issues, which are sporadically encountered by individuals infected with COVID, refer to the 
virus's long-lasting effects. While the majority of COVID-19 patients develop symptoms between a few days and a few 
weeks after contracting the virus, post-COVID complications can manifest at least four weeks after the initial infection 
(CDC  2021).  
Machine learning is a branch of computing algorithms that is constantly evolving and aims to simulate human 
intelligence by acquiring knowledge from its environment. They are regarded as the workhorses of the new big data era

learning models. This proposed methodology aims to combine various ML models effectively to make the best 
predictions, considering the diverse factors associated with post-COVID outcomes. After all the research, this research 
proposed an ensemble model to get maximum accuracy of after-COVID complexity. In order to improve classification, 
prediction, function approximation, and other aspects of sentiment classification, ensemble-based learning approaches 
the performance of a model or lessen the possibility of making a wrong move (Narayan et al. 2016) 
 
.

Using the model, it can separately predict multiple outcomes like tiredness, memory lost, chest pain etc. as well as it 
can diverse the predictions. The suggested model is tested against different benchmark methods, including decision 
trees, support vector machines, random forest as well as artificial neural networks. network etc. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this conference paper has delved into the potential of machine learning to predict post-COVID-19 
complications. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health emergency, as millions of people have been 
infected and a significant proportion of them have developed long-term complications. By using machine learning 
techniques, this study has shown that it is possible to identify individuals who may be at a higher risk of developing 
these complications. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in analyzing and predicting 
complex medical data. 
 
Using machine learning in healthcare has the ability to completely change how medical professionals approach patient 
care. By accurately identifying individuals who may be at risk of post-COVID-19 complications, healthcare providers 
can prioritize their care, allocate resources more efficiently, and ensure that they receive the treatments they need as 
soon as possible. Additionally, this research has important implications for the development of preventative measures 
and treatment protocols for post-COVID-19 patients. 
 
This study also emphasizes the significance of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of post-COVID-19 patients, as well 
as the need for additional research in this area. The application of machine learning in this field is still in its infancy, 
and there is much work to be done to refine and enhance these techniques. However, the outcomes of the research 
show that the ML has tremendous potential for improving patient outcomes and ensuring that post-COVID-19 patients 
receive the care they need. 
 
In conclusion, this conference paper has demonstrated the power of machine learning in predicting post-COVID-19 
complications, and it provides a glimpse into the future of medical care. The outcomes of this research will be of 
interest to healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers alike, and they highlight the need for continued 
investment in this area of research

Abstract  
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound influence on world health. While 
most infected individuals experience mild to moderate respiratory infections, some develop post-COVID 
complications with long-lasting effects. Detecting these complications early is crucial for better patient outcomes. 
This research explores the possibility of predicting post-COVID complications using patient data and machine 
learning algorithms. The study reviews existing literature on post-COVID complications and previous research efforts 
that have utilized machine learning in healthcare. It proposes model selection and training to improve prediction 
accuracy. The dataset is collected from COVID patients through a survey conducted with random Bangladeshi 
participants, and data preprocessing techniques are applied. Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and 
K-Nearest Neighbors are the four machine learning models selected and trained on the dataset. The models'
performance is evaluated, and their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting post-COVID complications are compared. 
The findings show that Decision Trees and Linear Regression have the best accuracy. Overall, this research highlights
the potential of machine learning in post-COVID complexity detection and contributes to advancing strategies for
managing the pandemic and its long-term effects. The study also proposes some future directions for related work,
which could be helpful in long-term research.

1. Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the coronavirus illness (Covid-19). Except for a few people who are extremely 
ill and require medical attention, the majority of infected persons will only experience mild to moderate respiratory 
infections and recover on their own (World Health Organization 2021). Many positive cases have been reported since 
2019, and people are suffering from this virus. However, the large number of vaccinations has led to a decline in

7. Conclusion 
In this study, we investigated the possibility of predicting post-COVID complications using patient data and machine 
learning algorithms. Collaborating data scientists, computer scientists, doctors, and experts from various fields worked 
together to harness existing data and machine learning models for disease prediction and long-term health conditions. 
Our research focused on detecting post-COVID physical complexities, which can have long-lasting effects on 
individuals who have contracted COVID-19. Through rigorous analysis and the application of various machine 
learning models, we found that linear regression and decision trees exhibited the highest accuracy in predicting post-
COVID complications, achieving 98.50% and 84.34% accuracy, respectively. These findings demonstrate the 
potential of machine learning in identifying patients at risk of developing post-COVID conditions and predicting the 
severity of symptoms. However, it is important to note that the complexity of post-COVID cases makes it challenging 
to rely solely on a single machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, integrating multiple models may lead to improved 
prediction accuracy.

Abstract 
In March 2022, Bangladesh proudly achieved nationwide electricity coverage. Predominantly reliant on fossil fuels, 
the nation's energy sector faces challenges due to global political crises and a dwindling supply of cleaner fuels like 
natural gas from domestic fields. Consequently, the reliance on less environmentally friendly fuels such as coal and 
heavy fuel oil (HFO) has escalated, raising concerns about meeting Sustainable Development Goal 7: ensuring access 
to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030. This study fills a research gap by quantifying the 
electricity generated from various fossil fuels and the associated CO2 emissions in Bangladesh from Fiscal Year 2016-
2017 to 2022-2023. Data sourced from the Bangladesh Power Development Board underpins our analysis, revealing 
natural gas as the predominant fuel for electricity generation, accounting for 58% of the total. Other significant fuels 
include HFO, coal, and diesel. Our findings show a stark emission landscape: in the last 7 years, to generate 74897 
MWh of electricity, 10395 kilograms of natural gas resulted in 4.39 tons of CO2 emissions, while HFO, coal, and 
diesel led to 8039165, 9950976, and 2743311 tons of CO2 emissions, respectively. Notably, coal combustion had the 
highest emission rate of 1892.586 kg of CO2 per MWh of electricity generated. These insights offer a critical lens for 
policymakers to gauge the distance to carbon neutrality and sustainable energy goals. The evidence supports a strategic 
pivot towards renewable energy, ensuring that Bangladesh's electricity growth trajectory remains sustainable and 
efficient.

that can secure a sustainable future for Bangladesh. By embracing renewable energy, Bangladesh can ensure that its 
journey towards electrification and modern energy access continues to progress sustainably, setting an example for 
other developing nations in harmonizing economic growth with environmental stewardship.  
 
6. Conclusions 
This comprehensive analysis of Bangladesh's energy sector offers a critical perspective on the nation's journey towards 
achieving carbon neutrality and sustainable energy. While the milestone of nationwide electricity coverage marks a 
significant achievement for Bangladesh, the reliance on fossil fuels casts a shadow over the environmental 
sustainability of this progress. The study's findings lay bare the stark realities of the current energy mix and its 
implications for carbon emissions. 
 
The predominance of natural gas as the mainstay for electricity generation is a double-edged sword; it's a cleaner 
burning fuel yet is in dwindling supply domestically. The shift towards coal and HFO, while addressing immediate 
energy needs, propels the nation further away from meeting its commitments to international climate goals and 
Sustainable Development Goal 7. The high CO2 emissions from coal combustion, despite its lesser role in electricity 
generation, is particularly concerning, signaling an urgent need for policy interventions. 
 
This analysis has quantified the emissions from different fossil fuels, revealing that to generate a unit of electricity, 
coal produces the most CO2, followed by HFO and diesel, with natural gas being the least polluting. These findings 
point towards an imperative to reassess the current energy strategy. With the global community moving towards 
greener policies, the continuation of a fossil fuel-dependent energy framework may subject Bangladesh to economic 
and environmental vulnerabilities. 
 
The path to sustainability and the achievement of carbon neutrality demands a multi-pronged approach. It is imperative 
to increase investment in renewable energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and develop a robust policy framework 
that supports a sustainable energy transition. It is also crucial to engage in international partnerships and seek climate 
finance opportunities to support this shift. 
 
Bangladesh's energy sector's future should be envisioned on the principles of sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity. 
Strategic planning and action today will ensure that the country's energy infrastructure is capable of supporting 
economic growth without compromising environmental integrity. As the nation moves forward, the insights from this 
study should inform a progressive energy policy that aligns with both national development and global sustainability 
objectives. 
 
By capitalizing on its renewable resources and adopting innovative technologies, Bangladesh can create a sustainable 
energy ecosystem that not only powers its economy but also contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable world. The 
journey towards carbon neutrality is challenging, yet it offers the opportunity for Bangladesh to lead by example in 
the South Asian region, demonstrating that economic development can go hand in hand with environmental 
stewardship.

Abstract 
The study of sophisticated route-planning techniques is a result of the increasing demand for quick drone delivery 
services. This study introduces a novel method that blends neural network predictions and Ant Colony Optimization 
(ACO). ACO draws inspiration from the way ants use pheromones or smell trails to choose the optimal routes. This 
aids in determining effective distribution routes, as does the use of neural networks—computer models that learn from 
data. The affordability of the drone utilized in this study is an intriguing feature. With an Arduino Nano microprocessor 
and an MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer, the drone can fly steadily and affordably. Data from Google Maps is 
included into these routes to make them more useful. Roads, buildings, and shifting traffic patterns are examples of 
real-world difficulties that are considered. This method's eco-friendly approach is yet another important benefit. The 
drone minimizes its environmental effect while covering a greater area with less fuel thanks to its fuel-optimization 
system. This blended model's preliminary testing yields encouraging findings. This method provides higher fuel 
savings and faster delivery times than conventional routing approaches. This study offers a thorough analysis of this 
combination approach, emphasizing how it may become the new norm for reasonably priced drone delivery.

Introduction 
Conventional routing algorithms frequently produced inefficient pathways, which raised operating costs and 
prolonged delivery times. These algorithms have trouble scaling as the number of delivery locations increases, 
particularly in crowded metropolitan regions. It was difficult to adjust to shifting conditions, such as weather patterns 
or air traffic, and this frequently resulted in delays. Finding the shortest path between several locations required a lot 
of processing power due to its high computational complexity. Drone load balancing was ineffective, which resulted 
in unequal consumption and wasteful use of energy. Lastly, the inadequate management of time-sensitive deliveries 
by old techniques frequently affected customer satisfaction and increased the environmental effect of each delivery. 
The proposed drone in this paper will give a thorough answer to earlier drone delivery problems by combining Ant 
Colony Optimization (ACO) and Neural Networks (NN). Even in dense metropolitan environments, ACO effectively 
optimizes multi-point distribution routes, significantly cutting operating expenses and delivery times while improving 
scalability. Because the paths are shorter and more direct, this optimization immediately contributes to energy 
efficiency and a less environmental impact. Utilizing historical information to apply NN for obstacle avoidance greatly 
improves the drone's safety and adaptability by enabling in-the-moment modifications to avert dangers and preserve 
flying stability. Furthermore, by utilizing past data to forecast delivery times, NN's scheduling accuracy is increased, 
resulting in more dependable service and higher customer satisfaction. In addition to improving delivery process 
efficiency overall, this dual strategy of ACO and NN also provides a greater level of safety and dependability, resolving 
many of the issues with drone delivery systems in the past.

Conclusion 
The dual strategy of combining NN with ACO solves a lot of the problems that drone delivery systems have historically 
encountered. In addition to providing accurate delivery time forecasts, it optimizes routing, increases safety, and increases 
energy economy. Because of this, the solution not only increases the effectiveness of the delivery process but also provides a 
greater degree of safety and dependability, overcoming a number of problems that previous drone delivery systems had. The 
evolution of autonomous drone deliveries has advanced significantly with the combination of ACO and NN, offering more 
effective and environmentally friendly last-mile delivery options.

Abstract 
Traditional cleaning processes in restaurant, wedding, and event settings often involve manual labor, resulting in 
time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks. Additionally, conventional sterilization and hygiene practices are not 
upheld. In this paper, an innovative solution is proposed to address the challenge of time-consuming and labor-
intensive cleaning processes in restaurant, wedding, and event settings by introducing an automated self-cleaning 
dining table. The development process has included the creation of an ergonomic machine prototype, the selection 
of suitable materials and machining techniques, and a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. This research explores 
the concept and potential benefits of this automated dining table, offering a promising solution for simplifying 
and improving the cleanliness of dining environments while enhancing efficiency and hygiene standards in a very 
short time.  
Keywords: 
Self-Cleaning Table, Ergonomic Design, Hygienic, Time-saving, Automation. 
Introduction 
Restaurants, weddings, and other events require manual table cleaning, which takes a lot of time. The required 
decontamination and hygiene standards are not always perfect as it is performed manually. In the USA, the FDA 
does not currently have any standards regarding the hygiene of dining areas (FDA, 2017)  . The repetitive cleaning 
process along with the disposal of leftovers can also be unpleasant and tiring. Considering these facts, our goal 
was to develop a dining table cleaning system that would get rid of all of these complexities of the cleaning 
process. We wanted to design a system that has the optimum ease of use for its customers. Following this, we 
went for a background check of similar types of projects. However, there has not been much work done in 
manufacturing or updating an automated self-cleaning dining table. Sokoot Jahromi et al. (2021) suggested a table 
with a moving component (chariot) that would automatically gather food waste and direct it to a garbage can 
placed next to the table. The table's moving component collects food trash as it moves along and uses alcohol 
spraying to sanitize the table as it returns to the starting place. 
To get a much better idea about how the structure of an automated dining table should be, the research of Duan et 
al. (2021) demonstrated how a dining table includes three functional modules, an inventive structure, various uses, 
and dependable performance. Tabletops and a cam-link combination mechanism make up the folding extension 
module. The desktop cleaning module comprises the friction wheel trolley, parallel four-bar, scraper, and space 
linkage mechanism. The waste collection module comprises a hinged four-bar mechanism, a trash container, and 
an ultrasonic cleaning tank. 
The cleaning mechanism of the self-cleaning dining table is a major issue to look into. Yin et al. (2020) showed 
robot employment in the cleaning procedure. But for an automated table, different mechanisms need to be 
implemented. Hu and Wei (2016) recommended an automatic cleaning device for dining tables that consists of a 
waste recycling bin, a cleaning system with cleaning brushes, and tabletop sterilizing lamps. 
To take the leftovers out of the table surface, we have considered using rolls of clean sheets for our proposed 
design.  Zhou et al. (2015) have proposed a system that is based on a smart tablecloth equipped with a fine-grained 
pressure textile matrix and a weight-sensitive tablet. It can determine how many pieces are cut on the main dish

4. Conclusion 
Our suggestion of a Self-cleaning Dining Table presents a promising answer to the labor- and time-intensive 
cleaning procedures at dining establishments, wedding venues, and event venues. We sought to streamline 
cleanliness, improve hygiene, and reduce human participation in our design by reviewing many prior efforts on 
related issues. This innovative approach could fundamentally alter how we approach sanitation and hygiene in 
typical eating spaces. It focuses on decreasing structural complexity and minimizing human participation, 
ultimately resulting in safer and more pleasurable dining experiences for everyone. To create a significantly 
improved version of our model, we believe that future researchers will find our ideas to be of tremendous use.

Abstract 
Cardiovascular diseases impose a major threat to public health in the developing world. Bangladesh, in the midst of 
an epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases, is witnessing a rising prominence 
of Lp(a). While higher Lp(a) is widely identified as a substantial threat for coronary artery disease (CAD), it is not 
regularly assessed in clinical practice. An investigation of higher Lp(a) levels in persons with LDL-C can aid in 
identifying the risk of cardiovascular disease.  People at high risk for CAD may be identified through evaluation for 
increased Lp(a) when coupled with LDL-C. This study addresses the interrelation between higher levels of Lp(a) and 
the risk of CAD at a variety of LDL-C levels. The study was conducted at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical 
College Hospital in Faridpur, Bangladesh which included 100 patients who were classified into low-Lp(a) and high-
Lp(a) catagories. These groups have been compared with the frequency of MACE and ACE. One of the key findings 
demonstrate that ACE and MACE were higher in the high-Lp(a), particularly when LDL-C was 1.4 mmol/L or higher, 
according to subgroup analysis that further subdivided patients based on LDL-C levels. Nevertheless, the relation 
ceased to exist if LDL-C were below 1.4 mmol/L. In short, the results establish Lp(a) as a viable noninvasive screening 
method for predicting CAD and prompt the development of Lp(a)-reducing therapies as an emerging concern. 
Keywords 
Lipoprotein(a) elevations, CAD, coronary strokes, cardiovascular disease and epidemiological transition. 
1. Introduction
CAD exhibits a significant mortality and disability rate, which renders it a prominent global health concern. A 
considerably high number of cases are reported to suffer from CAD annually, of which more than one-fifth will 
experience a recurrent stroke within a short period (Strong K, Mathers C, 2007). Although notable progress in the 
detection and treatment of CAD, patients still encounter MI, stroke, and the necessity for revascularization. The 
progress made in figuring out modifiable risk factors for CAD has enabled the development of practice protocols and 
evidence-based guidelines in medical treatment. These advancements have played a significant role in reducing 
mortality rates associated with CAD. Nevertheless, regardless of these breakthroughs, approximately 40% of all 
fatalities can be ascribed to CAD. Moreover, throughout the limited duration of clinical trials that assess treatments, 
only a minority of patients experience positive outcomes, while a greater number of adverse events occur in patients 
receiving active therapy compared to those that are averted. These findings indicate that the existence of extra risk 
factors has a role in increasing the risk of CAD. (Dariush Mozaffarian, Emelia J. Benjamin, Alan S. Go, 2014). Lp(a) 
elevation is a prevalent hereditary dyslipidemia that affects around 20% of the global population. It is considered a

4. Promising therapeutic approaches to minimize Lp(a)  
Initial studies explored mipomersen, an ASO inhibiting apoB mRNA, as a potential way to Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB in 
transgenic Lp(a) (Merki E, Graham MJ, Mullick AE, 2008). The method involved a substantial decrease in apoB 
synthesis, limiting Lp(a) assembly, without affecting apo(a) production. Clinical trials confirmed a 25% reduction in 
Lp(a) with mipomersen (Santos RD, Raal FJ, Catapano AL, 2015). Subsequently, ASOs specific to apo(a) for human 
trials demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in mean Lp(a) by over 80%. An advanced ASO, IONIS-APO(a)-LRx, 
designed for selective hepatocyte uptake, achieved substantial Lp(a) reductions (66% to 92%, up to 99% in some 
patients) and also reduced OxPL. This suggests that ASOs, particularly IONIS-APO(a)-LRx, hold promise for 
effectively reducing Lp(a) levels and mitigating associated cardiovascular risks. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Elevated Lp(a) levels are linked with repeated CAD, particularly in the presence of higher LDL-C levels. Nevertheless, 
it should be acknowledged that this correlation might differ in cases where LDL-C are exceptionally low. Patients 
who have both LDL-C values of 1.4 mmol/L or more and higher Lp(a) levels should be recognized as highly risky 
group. These patients necessitate extra interventions to lower LDL-C. Therefore, it is recommended that Lp(a) can be 
used as an alternative noninvasive diagnostic technique to forecast the degree of coronary artery blockages, thus 
allowing for its use before considering more invasive procedures. The study recommends that assessing Lp(a) levels 
can be beneficial in determining the risk level and planning personalized treatment, especially for individuals with 
distinct LDL-C and Lp(a) profiles. Furthermore, the request for future randomized studies emphasizes the necessity 
for more study to determine whether reducing Lp(a) levels can offer extra advantages in preventing cardiovascular 
events, particularly in individuals who have reached their LDL-C goals. This highlights the changing nature of 
cardiovascular risk evaluation and the significance of taking into account several indicators, such as both LDL-C and 
Lp(a), when providing treatment.

Abstract 
Globalization of trade, urbanization, and the international division of labor are the main factors, that have led to an 
increasing need for transportation—the opening of different economic markets and the interdependence between 
countries through the supply and demand of goods. Companies worldwide increasingly facing globalization. 
Specifically, they must satisfy their customers and improve their performance by optimizing each sub-process in the 
supply chain process Vehicle routing problem is one of the important combinatorial problems for goods distribution 
as well as for passengers’ transportation. Over time, many variants of this problem have been studied and several 
approaches have been proposed to obtain optimal solutions with exact methods or near-optimal ones using 
approximate algorithms (heuristic and metaheuristic). Recently, Machine learning techniques have been explored to 
determine the best solutions to VRP problems with high performance. In this review, we present the classical 
formulation of the vehicle routing problem as well as its most prominent variants. We provide an overview of the most 
significant machine learning concepts and techniques used in the literature for solving VRPs. To classify the papers, 
we followed the research methodology proposed by Mayring and we finally discussed the findings, analyzed the 
results, and compared each machine learning technique applied to this problem with other techniques.

1. Introduction
With the globalization of trade, the development of industrialization, and the boom in trade, companies are facing 
fundamental challenges, namely technological changes, increased competition, and the demands of market demand. 
As these customer demands have become increasingly unpredictable, the challenge of competitiveness for businesses 
is becoming ever greater: In this case, companies seek to stabilize and increase market share while minimizing costs 
and maximizing profits. To do this, companies must be able to thrive in this environment and meet demand to satisfy 
their customers, since the objective of all companies is to deliver products to their customers, of the requested quality, 
in the requested location, on the requested date, and at the lowest cost. A company's smooth functioning relies heavily 
on its logistics management. As a result, to stay ahead in the market, logistics is becoming increasingly vital. The 
efficiency of logistics is the determining factor in a company's effectiveness. Due to this evolution of logistics, we 
found that logistics is the most important part of logistics costs. Distribution logistics can be defined as a structure 
formed by the partners involved in the competitive exchange process to make goods and services available to 
consumers, users, intermediaries, or buyers. The objectives of a downstream or distribution. 
There are multiple logistics objectives, including satisfying the final customers, achieving profitability, and 
maximizing product and service quality. Downstream logistics involves determining the distribution system structure,

Introduction 
In Indonesia, water hyacinth known by its Latin name Eichornia crassipes is a type of plant whose roots have no 
growing medium except water. This wild water hyacinth plant is usually found in calm streams such as rivers or 
lakes, which has a negative impact, such as disrupting mobility in the water. For fishermen, the wild water hyacinth 
plant disturbs fishing boats, and this wild water hyacinth plant can damage the environment because the water 
hyacinth is The dead will accumulate little by little to the surface so that over time, the waters will become shallow 
and can disrupt the ecosystem in the waters. Water hyacinth waste crafts are enough to provide several changes to 
the environment and even create new jobs for the community at CV. TASHINDA, which is located on Jl. Bibis Raya, 
Kasihan District, Bantul Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Central Java, has managed water hyacinth plant 
waste as a basic material for crafts. 
Literature Review 
Assistance to water hyacinth craftsmen in Bantul, Yogyakarta was carried out to help water hyacinth craftsmen 
understand ergonomic furniture design. This assistance at least provides good and useful insight for further furniture 
design from water hyacinth craftsmen in the Bantul area, Yogyakarta. This mentoring activity lasted for 1 week, 
providing material on anthropometric data, measurements, tensile tests, and design using software. 
Product Development 
According to Harsokoerno (2004), product design is an initial step in the product manufacturing process. In the design 
stage, a decision will influence other activities that follow. Among these essential decisions are decisions that have 
consequences on whether the domestic industry can participate in a development project. According to (Ulrich-
Eppinger 2001), the product development process is divided into six stages (phases) of product development.

Abstract 
The research aimed to improve the operational efficiency in the cutting process of a wood beamline in a Peruvian 
sawmill using Lean Manufacturing tools. The study found a technical gap of 11.81% with an economic impact of 
4.94%. Three root causes were identified: breakdowns in the tableting machine, high setup times, and errors in the 
cutting process. To address these issues, the study proposed the use of engineering tools such as SMED and 
standardization of the work method. The implementation of these tools was expected to increase operational 
efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve product quality. The study's findings contribute to the literature on Lean 
Manufacturing and its application in the Peruvian manufacturing industry, highlighting the potential for efficiency 
improvements in the wood processing sector.

1. Introduction
Peru is the ninth country in the world with the greatest forest cover, more than 60% of its territory is covered by 
vegetation. The formal contribution of timber, the main forest product, to the national economy is only a small fraction 
of what it could be if timber were harvested sustainably, efficiently and with added value (Agricultura 2018). 
According to INEI (2016), the operational efficiency in the manufacturing sector is 70%, this percentage is found in 
the 2016 statistical compendium of Peru, since the sectoral report is done every 10 years it is still possible to use such 
data as a reference to compare our efficiency with that of the sector. 
After evaluating the identified problem, root causes such as machine stoppages due to breakdowns, reprocessing, 
breakage in the stock of PM, and defective raw material were detected. This problem was also identified in other 
research, for example; in an article from 2021 it is seen that the study seeks to propose an alternative approach to 
improve the manufacturing setup time and time between failures, seeking to eliminate outliers related to 
manufacturing setup times, performing simulations to compare the effect on lead time of both improvement strategies 
with traditional strategies of reducing the mean or variability (Utiyama et al. 2021). Another article of the same year 
talks about the implementation of the partial TPM methodology together with the 5's tool to increase the availability 
of equipment, where the novel sequence of application of tools allows the linking of lean with quality, highlighting 
that if applied in a correct sequence will allow solving persistent problems in a few steps resulting significant for 
companies (Marinho et al. 2021). The above- m e n t i o n e d  shows that wood companies (manufacturing sector) 
continue to have deficient processes while waiting for new industrial solutions to this problem.

Efficiency = (Actual capacity) / (Design capacity) 
 Efficiency = 427.04/609.8 
Efficiency = 70.01%  
 
With the improvements proposed and after carrying out a time study, it was observed that the technical gap was 
reached, an efficiency of 70.01% was reached, equaling the percentage of the sector, so it can be concluded that the 
improvements had a positive impact on the problems. 
 
6. Conclusion 
With the analysis of the current situation of the company, it is shown that through the implementation of the 
improvement proposal the company does not adequately use the opportunities to counteract the threats and in addition 
to this it has a weak reaction to its weaknesses. 
 
Through the use of the VSM tool, it was identified that the company recognizes that the most deficient processes are 
in the area of wood-cutting machinery, specifically the table saw, including setup time and errors made by workers 
at the time of cutting. 
 
With the application of the Lean Manufacturing tools, the main root causes were determined, the first cause to be 
solved is the breakdowns in the tableting machine, which represents 21.23%, the second cause to be solved is the high 
setup times that represents 20.63% and finally, the presence of errors in the cutting process in 19.08%. 
 
It is determined through the implementation that the project investment is recovered in 1.29 years, so the proposal is 
not only supported by the improvement in the indicators but also in the economic viability. 
The implementation of the improvement proposal is feasible since it has an Annual Net Value (NPV) of s/116,478.88 
and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 74.55%, values that demonstrate that the project is profitable since the NPV 
must be greater than 0 and the IRR greater than the Opportunity Cost (COK).

Abstract 
This study looks into a cutting-edge method for converting polyester waste of the garments industry into useful fuel 
and gas resources, offering a sustainable solution for effective waste management and resource recovery. The research 
investigates the application of novel thermal and chemical processes to effectively decompose polyester waste 
generated from different sections of the garments industry and extract energy-rich compounds that can be transformed 
into usable fuel and gas. Through comprehensive experimentation and analysis, this research demonstrates the 
viability and environmental benefits of this conversion method, presenting a promising avenue for reducing textile 
waste and producing alternative energy sources. Converted Gas from Waste Polyester demonstrates a moderate energy 
content, often ranging from 30 to 40 MJ/m³.Converted Fuel from Waste Polyester (Bio-oil) demonstrates an energy 
content ranging from 35 to 45 MJ/kg based on the specific composition obtained through pyrolysis. If Bangladesh 
were to implement efficient conversion processes for its waste polyester garments, it might contribute to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated range of 10,000 to 20,000 tons of CO2 equivalent annually, considering 
the volume of polyester waste generated in the country.

Abstract 
This study explores how employee skill sets in the retail industry are affected by the Fourth Industrial Revolution 
(4IR). Traditional retail has a strong need to change as technology rapidly alters consumer expectations. The study 
examines how workers develop new skill sets to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving 4IR market. Workers 
need to reevaluate and expand their skill sets because of the rapid changes in the Fourth Industrial Transition. The 
research dilemma highlights this. Workers are being forced to constantly broaden their skill sets due to the quick 
obsolescence of specific skill sets brought about by integrating technology, especially artificial intelligence. The 
primary study question focuses on how retail employees ensure their skill sets are still relevant in the face of the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution's disruptions. The study aims to identify the tactics retail employees use to get ready 
for how 4IR affect their skill needs. It’s significantly contributes to the area by offering insightful information 
about staff competencies in a retail setting. Feedback from participants provides insight into the strategies and 
training used to enhance skill sets and overcome 4IR's obstacles. The study expands on earlier research to better 
understand how 4IR influences retail employee skill sets. The investigation is expected to highlight the degree to 
which workers need to improve their abilities, acting as a resource for those looking to grow in the 4IR age.

these expanded skills in 4IR and ML is further highlighted in Figure 4. Higher bars on the chart denote greater 
relevance. It displays the importance of each skill set on a radial scale. Notably, the fourth industrial revolution's 
shifting needs and the incorporation of machine learning increased the significance of problem-solving and 
adaptability abilities. A simplified perspective of the strategic alignment of employee abilities with the changing 
retail sector landscape is provided by this graphical illustration. Training interventions enhance workers' skills, 
preparing them for the fourth industrial revolution and machine learning, as demonstrated by comprehensive skill 
level comparisons and a striking relevance chart. 
 
Conclusion 
Machine learning transforms the retail sector, enabling data-driven decisions and enhancing the digital workplace. 
To adapt to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), retailers must shift employee skill sets and focus on matching 
talent to the digital environment. Training programs and skill-building workshops aim to equip employees with 
the knowledge and skills to handle machine-learning technologies. The 4IR will require information professionals 
to learn, unlearn, and relearn new survival skills. Information schools should emphasize these skills, while 
information centers and libraries should provide continuous training. Job descriptions and roles should align with 
the 4IR, and information professionals should adopt the missing middle model. Personal human interaction is 
crucial for customer loyalty, and creating engaging customer experiences is essential. Retailers can use 2020 to 
grow by embracing evolving technological landscapes and consumer preferences. Human skills remain crucial 
despite the reconfiguration of human-machine collaboration. Studies demonstrate the advantages of machine 
learning and enhancing labor productivity. It exemplifies how the Fourth Industrial Revolution has made 
adaptability and lifelong learning necessary for retail employees. In a world where technology is advancing 
rapidly, machine learning and human skills are necessary to remain competitive. 4IR is causing a significant 
upheaval in the retail sector, and workers are essential to this process. The study's conclusions shed light on retail 
employees' proactive steps to upgrade their skills and match their competencies with the expectations of a machine 
learning-driven sector. Employees future-proof their jobs and help the retail industry remain resilient and 
sustainable in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era by embracing the possibilities of machine learning and 
cultivating a culture of continuous learning.

Abstract 
Forest fires in Indonesia have become a case that occurs every year. The National Disaster Management Agency 
estimates that 99 percent of forest and land fires occur on land. The largest forest and land fires in Indonesia occurred 
in 1997-1998, with an area of burned land of 9.2 million hectares. Annual forest fires in Indonesia not only harm the 
ecology and society in various ways, but also harm external parties. The impact of forest fires that occur every year 
has raised concerns for many parties, both regionally and internationally. Environmental and economic approaches 
are very important in efforts to rehabilitate forests destroyed by fire. The basis for making a Flame Freeze Connector 
for fire emissions in areas where fires occur which require continuous spraying of air onto burning land. The VDI 
2221 approach was used in this design to optimize the materials, technology and economics of the tool. The design 
results show that the Flame Freeze Connector works from all components that form a unified product that can 
extinguish fire with flame freeze (fire poison). The result is a flowing water discharge of 23.3 m³/s, where the greater 
the rotation speed of the feeding pump, the greater the water discharge produced which affects the pressure.

1. Introduction
Forest fires in Indonesia have become a case that occurs every year. The National Disaster Management Agency 
estimates that 99 percent of forest and land fires occur on land. Humans are the cause, while the influence of nature is 
only 1% (Ellyvon 2019). This behavior will be detrimental to humans because if nature is damaged then humans 
cannot use it; This illustrates the existence of reciprocal interactions between humans and nature or the environment

The final result of the calculation that has been carried out is that the final pressure (𝑃𝑃2) 1.82 bar or 1,82 x105 Pa. 
When compared to the known initial pressure, it can be concluded that the resulting pressure is still constant. 
1,8 x105 Pa it can be concluded that the resulting pressure is still constant. The effect of pressure and velocity 
variations in the calculation, it can be observed how variations in pressure, velocity, and altitude at various points 
in the fluid flow contribute to the total energy. A decrease in pressure can be offset by an increase in velocity or

4. The components that make up the Flame Freeze Connector include a threaded seat, pressure gauge, connector, 
collection cap and hose. 
5. Make or Buy analysis of the Flame Freeze Connector tool resulted in 2 components to be made, namely the 
seat / adapter and the container cap. The results of the Flame Freeze Connector operation map have a total of 
21 operation processes and 4 inspection processes. 
6. The results obtained from the calculation of water discharge data and hydraulic power are 0.972 m³/h and 
0.838 kW. The results of data acquisition are obtained from the results of density, cross-sectional area, and 
water flow velocity. 
7. The results obtained from the volume of water discharge and hydraulic power show that water discharge 
affects the speed of water flow. Flow velocity can determine the extent to which water can produce hydraulic 
energy or form hydraulic power that can be utilized.  
8. The calculation results with Bernoulli's Law show that the final pressure (P_2) is 1.82 bar or equivalent to 
1.82 x 10^5 Pa. When compared to the previously known initial pressure, which is 1.8 x 10^5 Pa, it can be 
concluded that the resulting pressure remains stable. In this calculation, the influence of variations in pressure, 
velocity, and altitude at various points in the fluid flow contribute to the total energy generated.

Abstract 
Research in composite materials is done in search of alternatives to existing materials. Composite materials provide 
plausible inexpensive, affordable, environment-friendly, and appropriately sustainable replacements for existing 
materials. In this paper, the mechanical properties of jute fiber composite and jute fiber-human hair reinforced hybrid 
composites are compared for a better understanding of the effects of human hair as reinforcements for natural fiber 
composites. The objective of this study is to test the appropriateness and limits of human hair as a reinforcement 
material when it comes to further reinforcing natural fiber composites. Towards that, woven jute fiber composite and 
woven jute fiber-human hair reinforced hybrid composite were manufactured using a hand lay-up process and then 
compared for their mechanical properties. Tensile, flexural, and impact tests are conducted on the fabricated composite 
to investigate their mechanical properties. The introduction of human hair in hybrid composites results in variations 
in tensile and flexural strengths compared to jute-only fiber composites. The tensile and bending toughness of the 
hybrid composite were 76% and 209% higher than the jute composite, respectively. The composite with human hair 
exhibits enhanced impact energy absorption and elongation at break, making them a promising alternative for 
scenarios demanding impact resistance and deformation accommodation. The hybrid composite has an energy 
absorption of 12.14 J, which is 15% higher than the jute composite's 10.59 J. This study explored the potential of 
human hair as a low-cost and widely available material to reinforce natural fiber-reinforced composites. Further 
studies are needed to bolster this analysis.

1. Introduction
Natural fibers with good mechanical properties, such as jute, bananas, hemp, etc., have biodegradability, and non-
toxicity qualities, while also offering more strength at a cheaper cost and a lighter weight. These elements considerably 
increase cost reductions (Manik et al. 2019). Natural fibers are also widely accessible in nature, which is a significant 
advantage. Composites are materials that offers enhanced properties compared to its constituent parts. The concept 
spans several centuries. Natural composites’ use can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as ""papyrus-
reinforced clay"" in ancient Egypt, which was used to make boats and various objects. The 20th century’s Industrial 
Revolution noted a significant turning point in composite development as engineers and scientists began 
experimenting with reinforcing composites with natural fibers.  
Numerous researchers have looked at cutting-edge methods of composite material synthesis and production. 
Researchers looked at using 3D printing to create polymer matrix composites with improved mechanical 
characteristics (Park et al. 2022). Similar to this, another study on electro spun carbon nanofibers and their reinforced 
composites was done (Yang et al. 2023) . A review was done on the estimated application of carbon nanotubes as 
reinforcing composite materials (Garg et al. 2021). The mechanical characteristics of composite materials are strongly 
influenced by the choice of reinforcing materials, a conclusion reached by studying the mechanical behavior of jute 
fiber-reinforced polymer composites while focusing on the impact of fiber orientation on strength and stiffness

The combination of human hair's flexibility and the robustness of jute fibers results in improved energy absorption, as 
human hair can dissipate energy more effectively upon impact. Furthermore, because of the hybrid composite's greater 
elongation ability, which indicates improved toughness, it can deform significantly before fracturing, absorbing more 
energy during impact. This improved performance could be attributed to a synergistic interaction between the two 
materials, in which the flexibility of human hair reduces stress concentrations within the composite, thereby increasing 
its overall impact resistance. 
 
4.4 Comparison of Mechanical Properties  
A thorough comparison of the mechanical properties of the bidirectional hybrid composite and the bidirectional jute 
composite has been conducted and presented in Table 1. From the table, it is noteworthy that the tensile toughness 
and bending toughness of the hybrid composite are significantly higher, about 76.69% and 209.32% respectively, than 
those of the jute composite. However, the hybrid composite exhibits lower tensile and flexural strengths, with 
reductions of 34.74% and 55.02%, respectively, compared to the jute composite. Nonetheless, the hybrid composite 
outshines the jute composite in terms of impact resistance, displaying an almost 15% increase in impact energy. Due 
to the flexibility of human hair, the hybrid composite boasts a higher strain capacity, which is 150% greater than that 
of the jute composite. Additionally, its stress-strain behavior highlights its energy-absorbing plastic deformation, 
making it a reliable option for impact resistance.  
Table 1. Comparison of mechanical properties 
 
5. Conclusion 
The key findings of this investigation can be summarized as follows: 
(1) The tensile toughness of the hybrid composite is 76.69% higher than that of the jute fiber composite. 
(2) The elongation at break of the hybrid composite is increased by 150% compared to pure jute fiber reinforced 
composite while the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity is decreased by 34.74% and 58.27%, 
respectively. 
(3) The bending toughness of the hybrid composite has increased by 209.32% compared to that of the pure jute 
fiber composite. 
(4) The flexural strength of the hybrid composite is reduced by 55.02% compared to the pure jute composite. 
(5) The impact strength of the hybrid composite is increased by 14.64% than that of the jute fiber composite.

Abstract 
Ground Heat Exchanger (GHE) is one of the most efficient sources of renewable energy where the heat from the fluid 
is either taken from or given to the ground. In this study, the increase in the Heat Transfer Rate (HER) of a Horizontal 
Spiral coil Ground Heat Exchanger (HSGHE) with fin has been analyzed and the difference between with and without 
fin GHE has been evaluated with the help of numerical analysis using the ANSYS 19 software. To compare the thermal 
performances, different shapes (rectangular and circular) of fin, sizes of fin length, and number of fins per turn of 
GHE coil were investigated with varying fin materials to evaluate an optimum outlet fluid temperature and HER for 
the HSGHE. The proposed model extracts heat from the working fluid and releases it to the ground, thus creating a 
cooling effect. Four pitch lengths of 0.03m, 0.04m, 0.05m, and 0.06m are considered. Three different fin materials: 
polyethylene, copper, and aluminum are used to evaluate the optimum fin material. It has been found from the analysis 
that the circular fin model with 0.04m pitch length of copper material increases the HER by 14.5% than the without 
fin model. The fin numbers were also varied from 4 to 8 fins per turn to observe the effect of the number of fins on 
HER. It has been observed that if the number of fins increases from 1 to 6 per turn of the spiral GHE coil, HER 
increases gradually. However, 7 or 8 fins per turn decreases the HER than the 6 fins per turn model. The effect of the 
fin length on the HER has also been investigated.

184.903W, and 184.952W respectively. So, the increase in HER is not significant enough. This type of nature in HER 
value can occur due to continuous heat dissipation from the fin and thus after a certain length of fin length, the HER 
does not increase significantly.

5. Conclusions 
Horizontal Spiral coil Ground Heat Exchanger for Ground Source Heat Pump is an effective technique for extracting 
heat from working fluid and releasing it to the ground. With the inclusion of fins on the GHE coil periphery, the HER 
of the GHE increases significantly. In this research, two different shapes of the fins, circular and rectangular, were 
evaluated, and between them, in terms of HER, the circular fin model (184.844W) showed better results than the 
rectangular fin model (176.455W). By varying pitch length, it was observed that lower pitch length provides better 
HER and 0.04m pitch length has the optimum heat transfer characteristics. Six (06) fins per turn of the GHE coil 
provided a HER of 184.844W, which decreases if the fin number is increased more than 6. Copper as fin material 
provided more satisfactory HER than aluminum and polyethylene. Moreover, increasing the fin length beyond 0.07m 
did not provide a satisfactory increase in the HER value. The HER increased by about 14.5% for the copper-made 
circular fin with 0.04m pitch length (Model-02) than without fin model.

Abstract 
The textile industry in Bangladesh, constituting the major share of the GDP, is mostly dependent on the strength of 
experience and cheap labor rate. However, it is facing challenges in small-scale production due to outdated technology 
and high operating costs. This particular sector, renowned for its global textile manufacturing role, particularly in 
ready-made garments, fabric manufacturing can benefit from aggregate planning. By aligning production with 
demand, optimizing resource utilization, and managing inventory effectively, following this strategy small textile 
companies can overcome operational shortcomings. To conduct the analysis process, the actual data utilized for 
examination encompassed a total of 517 product requirements. ABC analysis was done based on four months' 
requirements to identify products that generate the majority of sales. This strategic approach led to the selection of 12 
products, collectively contributing to 60% of the total requirements. MRP focuses on a select 12 products. While these 
products vary, the raw materials exhibit less diversity, with six types common to all. These raw materials are procured 
either locally or internationally. This study aims to explore the inclusion of aggregate planning in the textile industries 
of Bangladesh, evaluating its potential to significantly reduce costs and enhance overall production and material 
resource planning.

The Material Requirements Planning (MRP) calculations have been devised using a lot-for-lot approach for products 
1 to 6. However, product 5 is uniquely handled by consolidating the last total amount. This strategic decision is driven 
by the consideration that the individual amounts are relatively small, and the production time for this product is 
extended. Furthermore, each order entails the opening of a Letter of Credit (LC), incurring additional costs. By 
combining the quantities, the process becomes more efficient and cost-effective. 
 
The overarching MRP analysis underscores the potential benefits of adopting a hybrid sourcing strategy involving 
both local and foreign suppliers. The rationale behind this recommendation lies in the cost advantages associated with 
foreign sourcing. To implement this, it is suggested to procure the material requirements for July and August from 
foreign suppliers. This aligns with the notion that at the commencement of the planning period, a comprehensive MRP 
can be executed, allowing for meticulous planning and timely foreign orders. 
In essence, a nuanced approach that combines lot-for-lot strategies with the consolidation of smaller quantities and a 
dual-sourcing strategy can enhance overall efficiency, reduce costs, and streamline the Material Requirements 
Planning process. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The textile industry faces increasing global competition, necessitating the implementation of effective strategies for 
cost minimization. To remain competitive on the world stage, textile companies must explore avenues to reduce costs 
while meeting customer demands promptly. This project aims to demonstrate the applicability of aggregate planning 
in the textile industries of Bangladesh, showcasing its potential to significantly reduce costs and enhance overall 
production and material resource planning. 
 
The proposed solution suggests that by employing aggregate planning methods, textile industries can achieve 
substantial cost savings. This approach not only optimizes production but also enhances efficiency in material resource 
management. However, it is important to note that the model presented in this project may benefit from further 
refinement by incorporating additional variables and parameters to enhance accuracy and precision. 
In future research endeavors, considerations should extend to exploring scheduling techniques to refine the planning 
process further. Updating the overall mathematical model can contribute to achieving superior results. As the industry 
evolves, continuous efforts to integrate advanced methodologies will be crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in 
the global textile market.

Abstract 
The hospital is a health service unit that is responsible for public health problems. Hospitals certainly 
need blood to carry out service activities to the community which include the interests of organ 
transplant operations, cancer treatment, and other diseases to heal patients. Because the more levels of 
blood needed, of course, the need for an optimal blood distribution system to maximize blood quality. 
One of the most recent optimization techniques is the Symbiotic Organisms Search algorithm, also 
known as the SOS method. but the obstacles encountered in previous research this algorithm is not 
optimal in solving cases on a large scale. This paper aims to modify the Symbiotic Organisms Search 
algorithm to solve combinatorial problems on a large scale. Modifications were made by replacing the 
parasitism phase with the mutation phase and adding a local search as a guide for the initial solution. 
SOS modification algorithm will be compared with the original SOS algorithm and Particle Swarm 
Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results of the experiment found that the SOS Modification 
Algorithm was able to find the smallest distance compared to its two competing algorithms. So it can

Conclusion  
From the study that has been carried out, it can be concluded that the modification of the SOS algorithm 
is able to produce better distance output for blood bag distribution routes, for the Pekanbaru city area, 
compared to the original SOS algorithm and PSO algorithm. this can be seen in terms of the minimum 
distance that can be produced. The modified algorithm is able to provide the smallest distance for the 
distribution of blood bags with a total of. 37,51 while the original SOS algorithm is only able to produce 
the smallest distance in the number of 51,52 and the PSO algorithm 51,7. The fastest computing time 
that can be achieved by each algorithm with a very large maximum iteration parameter (1000000 
iterations), the modified SOS algorithm is 1,03 seconds, the original SOS algorithm is 4,35 seconds and 
the PSO algorithm is 2,38 seconds.

Abstract 
Optimizing supply chain costs is essential for maintaining a cost-effective yet efficient operation that can adapt to 
market changes. This research focuses on optimizing apparel supply chain costs by maximizing overall efficiency 
through the application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a linear programming (LP) approach. Yarn suppliers 
in the complex fabric supply chain are categorized into effective and average frontiers using DEA, providing a 
comprehensive evaluation of their performance. To assess independent efficiencies for each DMU, we formulated 
goal functions and constraints using MATLAB software allowing for a nuanced understanding of supplier 
performance within the selected subset. The collected data reveals crucial insights into yarn supply chain dynamics, 
emphasizing factors such as lead time, purchase profit, availability, and purchase quantities. The identification of role 
models within effective frontiers, depicted as convex curves, establishes benchmarks for suppliers seeking to improve 
efficiency. Ineffective Decision-Making Units (DMUs) within the curve gain insights into their shortcomings and 
strategies for improvement. Suppliers can identify role models by determining the shortest distance from effective 
frontiers, promoting the adoption of best practices. These insights serve as a foundation for strategic decision-making, 
empowering businesses to optimize supplier relationships and cost-effectively enhance overall supply chain 
efficiency. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of advanced computational tools in analyzing complex 
supply chain networks.

1. Introduction
The business focus on supply chain management has been influenced by the increasing diversity of customer demands, 
continued information technology improvements, and growing environmental concerns (Sheffi and J.B. Rice 2005). 
In the SCM (supply chain management) industry, selecting the right set of suppliers to supply materials and 
components to your manufacturer or products to your retailer is a common issue that has been a hot topic for decades. 
In a highly competitive global market, buyers with high expectations often look for supply chains to enhance their 
end-to-end capabilities, such as cost reduction and increased productivity. On the buyer’s side, purchasing department 
managers are constantly searching for competitive suppliers who can meet their needs and build long-term 
relationships (Park J et al. 2010). According to Chan (2003), supply chain management aims to gain an advantage in 
terms of customer service and cost over competitors. Supplier selection refers to the process of identifying, analyzing, 
and negotiating with suppliers as part of supply chain management. In the dynamic landscape of the apparel industry, 
where trends change rapidly and consumer preferences are evolving, efficient supplier selection plays a pivotal role 
in sustaining competitiveness and maximizing profitability. Considering the rapidly changing market conditions and 
customers seeking the best value, long-term relationships with vendors became very critical in the apparel industry. 
Therefore, apparel retailers are looking for vendors who can provide the best cost in the fastest way. The selection of 
suppliers involves intricate decision-making processes, as it necessitates the evaluation of multiple criteria while 
making the best use of available resources (Boer et al. 2001). The selection of suppliers involves intricate decision-

more profitable from the efficient supplier and what to do for reducing transportation cost, raw material cost and lead 
time. By selecting better industry can improve their efficiency, reduce the risk loss, and increase profit. 
7. Conclusion
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a liner programming technique or methodology is used to measure efficiency and 
evaluate the performance of Decision Making Unites (DMU). This is the most popular method for estimating the 
frontier for assessment of efficiency. DEA may categorize yarn suppliers into effective frontiers and average frontiers, 
as well as identify role models. All effective frontiers result in a convex curve, while ineffective DMU`s lie inside the 
curve. Other Supplier can find their role models by determining the shortest distance from these effective frontiers. 
The frontiers that are less effective can understand the reasons why this is happening and how to become more 
effective. In addition to this, the management team can learn which supplier to prioritize over others while making 
cost effective decisions. As a result, this research is aimed at demonstrating the application of DEA through study, 
showcasing its potential to aid businesses in making well-informed and efficient supplier decisions.

Abstract 
The garments industry in Bangladesh is a significant contributor to the country’s economic growth. However, it faces 
severe challenges in terms of fire safety. Yearly fire-related incidents not only cause harm to individuals but also result 
in substantial economic losses. This paper addresses the insufficient fire risk assessment in the garments industry and 
proposes the implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT) integrated fire prevention and alert system. By leveraging 
IoT devices and their integration into fire safety systems, this solution aims to save lives, protect property, and preserve 
the environment.

IoT; Garments; Safety Systems; Integrated Fire Safety 
        Introduction 
The use of IoT in safety monitoring has been discussed in (Kabir 2021). In various studies, researchers have shown 
how connected smoke sensors, fire alarm panels, and other smart devices can enhance fire safety (Saeed et al. (2018); 
Imteaj et al. (2017); Listyorini and Rahim (2018); Victoria Yalli et al. (2021), Rahman et al.(2023)). Therefore, the 
application of IoT devices in fire safety systems, particularly in garment factories, can save lives. This paper aims to 
propose an integrated fire safety system for garment factories using IoT devices, based on a risk assessment process. 
The goal is to find an effective IoT solution that can minimize risks to workers and assets during fire evacuations. 
Developing a conceptual model for fire safety in workplaces with a large number of employees, such as garment 
factories, would greatly benefit the industry (Wu et al. 2018). This becomes crucial due to the inadequate safety 
standards and regulations exposed by previous incidents, which also raised concerns about the responsibilities of 
factory owners and local authorities (Rae and Provan 2019). Considering the significant contribution of the ready-
made garments (RMG) industry to Bangladesh’s GDP, substantial improvements in factory safety, particularly fire 
safety, are necessary. 
Technological advancements, like the IoT, have brought significant changes to our lives. In the IoT paradigm, 
smart devices with unique identification are deployed to collect environmental data. These devices are connected 
to the Internet using advanced communication technologies to exchange information. The collected data is then 
processed to make intelligent decisions. IoT devices are widely used in various applications such as smart homes, 
smart cities, body networks, smart grids, and vehicles.

window or another secure location to wait for the rescue team, while also sending the user’s location to the authorities. 
Additionally, the app guides fire safety regulations during these critical situations. 
 
Apart from its features, the fire safety app offers multiple connectivity options. It will be available for download 
on both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The app ensures a safe working environment by verifying 
the presence and proper functioning of fire suppression equipment, along with strict adherence to fire safety 
regulations (Wang et al. 2020). It can directly receive notifications from fire detection sensors using Wi-Fi or 
Bluetooth, and it can also send fire alerts to nearby app users through these connections. Furthermore, the app can 
send fire notifications to a cloud server, notifying relevant authorities. In an emergency, the app sends SMS 
messages or pre-recorded voice calls to various stakeholders, including garment workers, owners, local 
authorities, and the fire service department. It can also send alarm messages to an assigned email address when a 
smoke detector is triggered in a garment factory. The primary goal is to keep all stakeholders informed about the 
situation. 
 
4.2 Fail-safe System 
If any of the sensors stop working, the nearby sensors can detect this and inform the system administrator. The system 
itself can recognize sensors that are experiencing problems by communicating with them. In case there is an obstacle 
on the escape route or emergency door, the sensors can detect it and inform both the system administrator and the 
local authorities. If the cloud application server of the app is not working, it can still communicate with other nearby 
mobile phones through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection. 
 
        5. Conclusion 
There are many casualties and damages to both people and property in Bangladesh as a result of fire incidents. 
However, we can minimize or prevent such losses by employing technology, implementing fire prevention policies, 
raising awareness about fire safety, providing training, promoting moral ethics, and enforcing rules and regulations 
through relevant authorities. To address this issue, a system that combines the IoT with fire prevention and alert 
capabilities is being proposed. The primary objective of this system is to save lives and prevent property damage. 
Currently, this integrated system is in the conceptual stage, but efforts are underway to transform these ideas into a 
fully operational system. The goal is for the software version of this system to effectively reduce fire-related losses in 
garment factories throughout Bangladesh.

Abstract 
Natural fiber focuses on reducing product weight and expense while limiting the environment's impact. Composite 
materials are continuously evolving, as are the industries that support them. Natural fibers have recently sparked 
greater investigation. These composite materials have a variety of uses. Natural and synthetic fibers work together to 
provide a stronger substance. Synthetic fibers are often not environmentally friendly and are not recyclable, making 
them damaging to the environment. In this present research work analysis of different mechanical properties like 
tensile, flexural strength, and impact on natural fibers (jute, murta, and cotton) as hybrid composite in four 
combinations (jute-cooton-jute, murta-cotton-murta, jute-murta-jute and murta-jute-murta) are studied. Each 
combination consists of two natural fibers where one has two layers of woven fiber and another has one layer of woven 
mat. Epoxy resin as matrix material and hardener with natural fibers as the reinforcement material is used to make the 
specimens. The hand lay-up technique is used to fabricate the specimens. After testing the specimens, it was found 
that the jute-cotton-jute fiber hybrid composite has superior tensile property and water absorption properties and the 
jute-murta-jute fiber hybrid composite has superior flexural and impact properties as compared to the other hybrid 
composites.

Abstract 
Jute packaging materials have garnered industrial interest and recent research attention for their antimicrobial finishing 
for food safety and security. This research paper addresses the growing need for sustainable packaging solutions in 
the food industry and explores the development of functional jute fabric as a viable alternative. The study aims to 
enhance the functional properties of jute fabric to meet the demanding requirements of food material packaging. The 
research methodology involves a systematic approach to impart antibacterial properties to the jute fabric. Various eco-
friendly and food-safe additives are considered for treatment, including surface coatings and chemical modifications. 
The antibacterial efficacy is assessed through agar disc diffusion method against common foodborne pathogens. The 
study explores the optimization of treatment parameters to achieve effective microbial inhibition without 
compromising the overall integrity of the jute fabric. Special attention is given to ensuring that the developed 
antibacterial properties comply with safety standards for food contact materials. The findings of the research indicate 
a successful enhancement of the mechanical strength and functional properties of jute fabric for food material 
packaging. The research demonstrates the successful development of functional jute fabric with enhanced antibacterial 
properties against Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Escherichia coli bacteria and the zone of inhibitions for those 
bacteria were 11 mm and 12 mm respectively. The significant efficiency of such antibacterial activities against 
foodborne pathogens might help ensure the safety and prolong the shelf life of packaged food goods. The findings 
suggest that the fabricated jute fabric holds promise as a sustainable and effective alternative to conventional 
packaging materials.

Abstract 
Public services in Indonesia are currently facing challenges to meet the increasing expectations of the public amid 
limitations in budgetary resources, human capital, and institutional capacity. Public services provided by the Ministry 
of Industry implement Total Quality Management (TQM) and service innovation to enhance service quality, as well 
as risk management to achieve organizational goals and objectives. This study aims to investigate the structural 
relationship between TQM, Service Innovation, and Risk Management on the organizational performance of the public 
sector within the Ministry of Industry. Data collection was conducted through an online survey of 23 public service 
units within the Ministry of Industry, resulting in 316 collected responses. The data were analyzed using Structural 
Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings indicate that the implementation of TQM, service innovation, and risk 
management in the Ministry of Industry's service units positively and significantly influences organizational 
performance, aligning with theoretical literature. The most influential dimensions of TQM are culture, processes, and 
human resources, while leadership is identified as an area needing improvement. Service innovation and risk 
management act as partial mediation in influencing the relationship between TQM and organizational performance. 
The research findings are expected to provide guidance for managers and stakeholders in enhancing operational 
effectiveness and overall performance of public service organizations in the industrial sector. Additionally, this study 
contributes to academic literature in the fields of organizational management and the public sector by presenting 
empirical evidence on the relationships between TQM, service innovation, risk management, and organizational 
performance.

1. Introduction
The provision of public services in Indonesia is based on the regulations stipulated in Law Number 25 of 2009 
concerning public services. The implementation of public service systems must adhere to the general principles of 
good governance and corporate governance, including elements of professionalism, transparency, accountability, 
timeliness, speed, ease, and affordability (Pemerintah Republik Indonesia, 2009). The government strives to provide 
quality services according to the needs of the community, as good public services positively impact the satisfaction 
and trust of the public in the government (Lanin & Hermanto, 2019; Lestariningsih et al., 2018). However, achieving 
public satisfaction is challenging due to continuously rising public expectations amidst limited resources (Mättö, 
2019). Evaluating the quality of public services is crucial for assessing public satisfaction (Van Ryzin, 2006), yet the 
supervisory body overseeing public service administration in Indonesia (Ombudsman) reported 8,292 complaints from 
the public alleging maladministration in public services throughout Indonesia in 2022 (Ombudsman Republik 
Indonesia, 2022). These allegations included violations of procedures, abuse of authority, discrimination, and others. 
Pribadi (2021) stated that factors such as service quality, accountability, work culture, and service performance 
influence public satisfaction, emphasizing the need for the government to consider these various factors in providing 
public services according to the needs of the community and existing laws. 
Public service organizing organizations are obligated to provide public services in accordance with their established 
objectives, covering the implementation of services, managing public complaints, information management, internal

AI-Based Paperless Container Delivery System; a Model for 
Smart Chittagong Port 
Lt Col Mostafa Arif-ur Rahman, 
Major Md Wahidul Haque 
Abstract 
Information Technology (IT) is transforming rapidly and solely igniting the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) and 
providing a lot of conveniences to increase productivity and efficiency. Similarly, seaports, being the major players 
of the supply chain have undergone many rapid developments with the introduction of containerization. Chittagong 
port continues to cope with the changing pattern of trade and aspires to be a smart port in line with Smart Bangladesh's 
Vision 2041. This research aims to evaluate the delay and security concerns of the paper-based container delivery 
process from the yard and suggest an AI-based paperless delivery system. A combination of both quantitative and 
qualitative methodology is used in this research. It is found that in a year, amongst 0.3 million container trailers, 36605 
(approximately 10.2%) trailers were cleared in less than one hour and 62466 trailers (approximately 20.1%) took more 
than 12 hours. Based on this result, in-depth interviews of 19 people from five stakeholders were collected and 
thematic analysis with Atlas Ti was conducted. The result of the study shows that an RFID-based rewritable Smart 
Device System with specific database connectivity with three servers of two ministries can reduce the average time 
of delivery to less than one hour. It also shows that AI-based face recognition applications at the gate entry, exit, and 
delivery point can reduce forgery to zero level, meaning it can make 100% safe delivery. The outcome of this research 
is expected to make Chittagong Port’s container delivery system approximately ten times more efficient and 100% 
secure. This will in turn reduce approximately 90% of container trailer-related traffic movement and jams inside and 
outside the port area and make the port safer and more secure.

 Abstract 
Efficient healthcare system relies on well-placed blood facilities. Blood centers collect donated blood, process it, and 
deliver it to hospitals for transfusion. Due to the importance of health care, this study addresses blood center placement 
as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The purpose of this study is to develop a decision support 
system for determining the right location within the healthcare system  for establishing a blood center in Rajshahi's 
most densely populated district. The system is developed through MCDM technique, Using the Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) combined with TOPSIS, which guides decision-makers in evaluating and selecting appropriate blood 
center locations. By using the system, identified criterias are weighted by AHP, and then alternatives are ranked by 
TOPSIS. Based on the normalized criteria weights, the ideal best and worst values of each of Rajshahi's four thanas 
have been determined. Based on the analysis of all alternatives, a score of six criteria determined Shah Mokhdum a 
thana to be the top, Motihar thana to be the second, Boalia to be the third, Rajpara thana to be the fourth. Shah 
Mokhdum thana emerged as  the most suitable, since it met all of the criteria. In this strategic process, this integrated 
approach helps decision-makers make more informed decisions by providing a comprehensive analysis of the 
alternatives. The proposed blood center will benefit the local community by providing safe blood to those in need.

1. Introduction
Access to reliable and timely blood supply is crucial for effective healthcare delivery. Blood Centers play a vital role 
in ensuring an adequate and safe blood supply is available for patients in need. However, the selection of blood bank 
locations requires careful consideration and analysis. With the increasing trends and growing demand for blood, it is 
essential to carefully plan to ensure an adequate supply of blood. The decision regarding the blood center's placement 
significantly impacts both the organization's success and the well-being of the population it serves. The uncertainties 
surrounding the blood supply and demand, perishability of blood, and compatibility of blood types make the selection 
of blood bank locations a challenging task [2]. In case a blood center is set up in the wrong location, it may lead to 
inefficiencies, inadequate blood supply, and increased transportation costs. Facility location decisions are particularly 
important in the healthcare system because any abnormality might lead to mortality or morbidity (Rusman, 2014). It 
is crucial to employ thorough and efficient decision-making methods for selecting the location of blood banks. During 
crisis like covid 19 pandemic, natural disasters, or other emergencies, the importance of having easily accessible and 
strategically placed blood banks becomes even more critical (Larimi, 2022).Rajshahi is one of the most densely 
populated cities in Bangladesh, and ensuring an efficient blood supply chain is essential to meet the healthcare needs 
of its residents [5].There is a shortage of safe and reliable blood supply in Rajshahi resulting in difficulty in providing

5. Results and Discussion  
In the first phase of our study, we identified and defined a set of critical criteria for evaluating the optimal location of 
a blood center and conducted pairwise comparisons among these criteria to establish their relative importance. The 
results of the AHP analysis revealed the hierarchical structure of criteria importance. The weights assigned to each 
criterion indicated their contributions to the decision-making process. Hospitals emerged as a highly significant factor. 
Building upon the criteria weights obtained from the AHP analysis, we proceeded to evaluate potential blood center 
locations using the TOPSIS method. We formulated a decision matrix that integrated data related to each criterion for 
all possible locations. By calculating the distance of each alternative from the ideal solution and the negative-ideal 
solution, we quantified the relative closeness of each location to the optimal choice. After evaluating all alternatives, 
Shah Makhdum Thana emerged as the top performer, Motihar thana is second in rank. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, we presented a decision support system that combines AHP and TOPSIS methods to guide the optimal 
location selection of a blood center in Rajshahi City Corporation. The systematic process of criteria identification, 
weighting, and alternative ranking offers decision-makers a comprehensive and transparent framework for making 
strategic choices. Our study contributes not only to the field of healthcare facility location but also to the broader realm 
of multi-criteria decision-making, offering a practical methodology that can be adapted to various strategic planning 
scenarios. In the future, researchers can explore the use of other Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques 
such as Vikor to solve problems related to blood center facilities. Comparing the results obtained from these different 
methods can provide further insights. Additionally, the process can be modified by including more criteria, sub-
criteria, and alternatives for improved results. Machine learning techniques can be utilized to determine the optimal 
location for a blood center, by selecting the appropriate algorithm such as supervised or k-means clustering.

Abstract 
Heat exchange is a common operation in many processing industries, such as petrochemicals, refineries, 
pharmaceuticals, thermal, chemical, and integrated industries like food, dairy, and sugar. Various passive 
techniques, such as twisted tape, HiTrain wire matrix mold, and others, find extensive use, as they are inexpensive 
and simple to use. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of utilizing a porous density (PD) twisted 
tape insert in place of a standard twisted tape on heat transfer performance. It is assumed that the fluid flow is 
turbulent, incompressible, and steady. The energy loss resulting from fluid motion is disregarded, but the flow 
and heat transfer processes are thought to be fully developed. The twisted tape inserts in the trial will have a twist 
ratio of 10 and a Reynolds number range of 5,000 to 12,500. There will be three distinct densities of porosities in 
the twisted tape geometry such as highly dense, low dense, and without porosity twisted tape. SolidWorks was 
used to create the solid model's geometry, while ANSYS was used to create the fluid model and perform the 
simulation. The objective was to evaluate the hydrothermal performance of porous-density twisted tape inserts 
with varying perforation ratios in the tube, ranging from low to high density, in comparison to normal twisted 
tape.

1. Introduction
Heat exchangers are apparatuses that facilitate the transmission of heat between two or more incompatible fluids, 
including gases, vapors, and liquids. Regardless of the type of heat exchanger used, the heat transfer process can 
be gas-to-gas, liquid-to-liquid, or liquid-to-vapor. It can also happen through direct fluid contact or a solid 
separator, which prevents the fluids from mixing. Heat exchangers find several uses in both residential and 
commercial environments. When building a heat exchanger system, engineers must take into account a number 
of factors, such as the fluid's properties that will flow through the tube, the material of the shell and tube, and the 
structural design. This is because the efficient and effective conveyance of liquid or gaseous fluids in industry is 
dependent on the design of the heat exchanger system. A heat exchanger's stream design details the interconnected 
growth of the fluids within the heat exchanger. Heat exchangers employ four different flow configurations: hybrid, 
cross, co-current, and counter current. Twisted tape (TT) inserts are a newer form of passive heat transfer 
enhancement technology that is gaining attention due to its high transfer efficiency, swirl flow formation, longer 
residence period, and secondary flow generation perpendicular to the flow. The most important and effective 
passive method of improving heat transfer performance is to employ TT inserts, which enhance heat transfer 
performance without increasing system volume. Heat transfer enhancement by introducing the twisted tape (TT) 
for both laminar and turbulent flows is one of the promising swirl generators. Twisted tape inserts are thought to 
improve heat transfer by encouraging transverse mixing, creating swirl flow or vortex inside a heat exchanger, 
effectively disrupting the thermal boundary layer, and dissolving the viscous sublayer. Additionally, a twisted 
tape can be inserted and introduced with ease into an existing model that has a heat exchanger tube. (Ramteke et 
al. 2014)

compared to low porosity and regular TT inserts. The PEC for high porosity TT insert varied from 1.206 to 1.268 
at different Re, while low porosity TT inserts ranged from 1.133 to 1.217, and standard TT inserts ranged from 
0.742 to 1.110, all in comparison to the plain tube. 
 
The high porosity TT insert showed a significant 62.5 percent improvement over standard TT and an efficiency 
boost of over 6.44 percent over low porosity TT in twin pipe heat exchanger performance. Thus, across a range 
of Reynolds numbers, high porosity TT inserts were found to be more effective than both standard and low 
porosity TT inserts.

5. Conclusion 
The study's main objective was to evaluate the effects of twisted tape inserts with a porous density (PD) on heat 
transfer efficiency in a closed conduit using numerical methods. Plain tubes, normal twisted tapes, and high and 
low porosity tapes were all compared in the study. Twisted tape inserts improved heat transmission and fluid 
mixing between the center and edge fluids by increasing circumferential velocity. In comparison to alternative 
inserts, high porosity twisted tape demonstrated superior thermal conductivity and produced lower temperatures. 
 
High porosity twisted tape had larger pressure drops, which expanded the pressure ranges. When considering 
various types of twisted tape with varying Reynolds numbers, high porosity tape consistently had higher Nusselt 
numbers. A higher friction factor and a higher pressure drop were observed in the high porosity twisted tape. 
According to the study, high porosity twisted tape outperformed low porosity and conventional twisted tape inserts 
in terms of efficiency, greatly enhancing the performance of the twin pipe heat exchanger. For high porosity 
twisted tape, the Particle Efficiency Coefficient (PEC) was highest over a range of Reynolds numbers.

Abstract 
In globally AAC, AAAC & ACSR (All Aluminum Conductor, All Aluminum Alloy Conductor & Aluminum 
Conductor Steel Reinforced) are most used for transmission lines. To transfer bulk power from long distances and to 
meet the increased load demand either we must construct the new UHV (Underground High voltage) or EHV (Extra 
High Voltage) transmission lines or update the existing transmission lines (Required New Structure- Like all Tower, 
pool and all other related accessories Including Conductor & New Land). Uprating of existing transmission lines 
(Required New Structure- Like all Tower, pool, and all other related accessories Including Conductor & New 
Land)..i.e. modifications in the existing transmission line to enable increased current flow limits. Making new 
transmission lines also has a few constraints: ROW constraints (Lack of availability of corridors for construction of 
new transmission lines due to High Population Density, waste of fertile land, and Forest/ Ecology conservation) and 
Time constraints.

2. Introduction 
In the realm of industrial operations, the optimization of expenses and efficient time management are paramount objectives. However, 
the challenge persists due to the inefficiencies arising from the scattered distribution of necessary items across various locations within 
factories, resulting in substantial time and labor costs (Yerpude, 2018). To address this issue, the implementation of a Smart Inventory 
Management System (SIMS) emerges as a promising solution, offering streamlined operations and enhanced productivity (Bose et al., 
2022). This innovative system efficiently stores and organizes product data, facilitating swift location of desired items within the 
inventory, thereby minimizing search time and labor costs (Chen et al., 2019). Although the concept of SIMS may appear simplistic at 
first glance, its long-term benefits are profound, offering a straightforward and cost-effective return on investment (Skuvault, 2019). 
The novelty of the SIMS lies in its user-friendly interface, optimized operation, ergonomic design, minimal maintenance, and cost-
effectiveness. Leveraging SIMS yields substantial time and cost savings, simplifies product location, and provides real-time inventory 
visibility. Additionally, the system enables inventory optimization and enhances organizational security through customizable user 
authentication (Skuvault, 2019). Efficient inventory management is particularly crucial in industries such as food processing and 
distribution, given the substantial volume of stored products that can escalate costs and reduce warehouse efficiency (Lianga, 2013). 
Traditional inventory management models often struggle to cope with the complexities of global enterprises, resulting in inefficiencies 
and operational bottlenecks (Srivastava, Kumar Choubey, and Kumar, 2020). However, emerging technologies like Wireless Sensor 
Networks (WSN) are revolutionizing inventory management by providing real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making 
capabilities (Zhang, Alharbe, and Atkins, 2017). These systems, based on lot-sizing techniques and IoT devices, optimize inventory 
levels and streamline replenishment processes (TAMER and KOKLU, 2021). Moreover, specialized inventory management systems 
tailored for specific industries, such as construction and hospitality, further enhance efficiency and resource utilization (Jing and Tang, 
1013","Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Industrial & Mechanical Engineering and Operations Management, Dhaka, 
Bangladesh, December 26-27, 2022

Abstract 
This research aims to address the persistent challenge of delayed machine fault notification in textile factories through 
the development of a cost-efficient alert system tailored specifically for this industry. Delayed notification of machine 
faults often leads to substantial downtime and diminished operational efficiency in textile manufacturing settings, 
where workers must navigate cumbersome communication channels to inform management and request technical 
assistance. To overcome this obstacle, the project proposes the implementation of an alert system integrating Internet 
of Things (IoT) devices and wireless communication technologies. This system ensures the seamless transmission of 
real-time alerts, thereby enabling swift response to machine malfunctions. Accessible through intuitive user interfaces 
on handheld devices or strategically positioned control panels near machinery, the system streamlines the fault 
reporting process and reduces the time and manual effort required to notify floor supervisors and technicians. By 
facilitating rapid communication, this project aims to enhance operational efficiency and minimize production 
disruptions in textile factories.

1. Introduction
In many textile factories, the responsibility of reporting machine breakdowns falls on the workers or supervisors, who 
typically use their mobile phones or relay the information manually to managers or technicians. However, the time 
taken in this information transfer process can be substantial, leading to increased lead times and missed production 
deadlines. Thus, there is a clear need for an affordable system in this sector that streamlines the process, independent 
of the varied working procedures of the machinery, by allowing manual input from workers to notify technicians of 
breakdowns promptly. This project aims to develop such a system to facilitate breakdown maintenance, improving 
communication between supervisors and workers and ensuring swift notification of machine failures. By minimizing 
downtime and establishing an efficient fault resolution system, it will enhance operational productivity. Moreover, it 
will address challenges posed by remote machine placements, reducing repair delays and enhancing responsiveness. 
The target customers for this system are industrial and manufacturing companies with diverse production processes, 
including both large corporations and small-scale factories across various industries such as automotive, electronics, 
and consumer goods. The primary objective is to mitigate these shortcomings while ensuring a cost-effective 
implementation approach. However, many machines in textile and other factories lack such systems and are 
predominantly operated manually.  
Concerns may arise regarding the use of traditional communication methods, such as manual phone calls between 
workers and managers to report machine faults, which can result in time wastage and communication gaps. The 
proposed Alarm System for Machine Maintenance addresses this challenge by offering a proactive solution that 
integrates manual alerts with real-time layout plan visualization. By doing so, it aims to substantially enhance 
maintenance efficiency and operational productivity.

Abstract 
Fabric, a versatile material composed of interwoven fibers, serves diverse purposes spanning from clothing and 
furnishings to industrial applications. It exists in both natural forms like cotton and wool, and synthetic forms such as 
polyester and nylon, each impacting characteristics like texture, breathability, and strength. Fabric structure refers to 
the construction of textiles, particularly evident in woven fabrics where yarns interlace perpendicular to each other, 
forming geometric patterns like plain, herringbone, and diamond. The textile industry continuously innovates fabric 
production techniques, including automated processes and software-driven quality control. This paper explores the 
development of a novel software system for automatic fabric structure detection, leveraging advanced algorithms to 
analyze images and categorize fabric patterns. This innovation holds promise for streamlining quality control and 
aiding design processes in industries like textiles and fashion. The research demonstrates the efficacy and accuracy of 
the software, marking a significant advancement in automated fabric analysis. Furthermore, it highlights the potential 
applications in textile manufacturing and quality assurance, contributing to improved efficiency and laying the 
groundwork for enhanced quality control processes. Ultimately, this paper aims to innovate fabric formula detection, 
empowering industries and consumers, fostering efficiency, and advancing knowledge in the field.

Abstract 
The leather tanning industry is essential to Bangladesh's economy, significantly boosting employment and 
economic growth in the country. More than a million Bangladeshis work in this sector, which provides 
chances for both skilled and unskilled labor.But the chemical management component of tanneries carries 
inherent hazards, hence existing approaches need to be reassessed and redesigned.  However, there are 
significant obstacles to improving the tanneries' working conditions and productivity in the chemical 
management part. To develop productivity and safety, lean is an option that needs to be explored more 
widely in the tannery context. Through interviews with industry expertsand a careful evaluation of the body 
of current literature, this study has identified potential barriers to starting lean practices in the chemical 
management of the production floorAfter the literature review, the barriers are analyzed using the MCDM 
tool to rank them according to the collected data.  The barriers will be ranked using the Best Worst method. 
In order to overcome these significant obstacles and enable the successful adoption of lean techniques for 
sustainable chemical management in Bangladeshi leather tanning, policymakers, tannery owners, and 
development organizations can benefit significantly from the information provided by this study.

5. Conclusion 
Safe chemical management has become a clearly demanding topic for Bangladesh's tannery sector as a result of the 
industry's struggles to meet the demands of international brands and buyers due to its non-compliance with regulations 
regarding unsafe chemical handling, which results in the loss of customers, reputation, work orders, and negatively 
impacts the health of workers (Hossain and Hossain 2023). After reviewing many articles, the authors found that no 
specific studies have been done for lean implementation in chemical section as Lean production is one of the powerful 
transformations that has been widely explored and practiced by a meaningful number of organizations worldwide 
(Belhadi et al. 2018). Moreover, Lean offers various benefits for industry practitioners, such as preventing rework and 
addressing safety concerns in addition to enhancing customer satisfaction and meeting quality standards. Nevertheless, 
the benefits of Lean have not yet been well understood by industry practitioners for several reasons, such as the cost 
of using Lean tools or the lack of experience in Lean implementation (Demirkesen and Bayhan 2022).  
Thus this study focuses on identifying the major barriers for implementing successful lean practices in the chemical 
management, weighing and ranking them using MCDM’s Best-Worst method tool. Within this context, 8 main factors 
were identified such as successful communication, Stakeholders Cooperation, Environmental Performance, Technical 
Capabilities, Lack of management commitment, Organizational Policy, Operational issue, and Finance barriers that 
are liable for chemical management deviation in Bangladesh tanning industry. After finalizing the factors or barriers 
from literature review, few tannery industry experts were selected for their feedback about the selected barriers. In the 
context of Bangladesh, ‘Operational Issue’ was found to be the foremost barrier and ‘Organizational Policy’ was found 
to be the worst or least barrier to implementing Lean activity in the chemical section. The factor ‘Operational Issue’ 
means that the majority of the workers have inadequate knowledge in chemical storage and unloading due to the lack 
of training. Also, they have inadequate knowledge about every chemical operation and the consequences of poor 
chemical handling in the tanning industry. Moreover, solutions like development of organizational learning culture, 
early deployment of lean culture through training and allocation of sufficient time and resources for change are also 
important. 
The study consists of some limitations, the aforementioned claim can only be justified within the resources and time 
constraints in which this study was conducted. Firstly, feedback taken from the participants or industry experts to 
analyze were limited. Secondly, the research for leather industry is limited and that is why less research paper for lean 
implementation was found on different databases such as scopus, google scholar etc. This research can help other 
Bangladesh industries, such as textile, food processing, polymer, pharmaceuticals, and etc. adopt Lean practices in 
their manufacturing. All of these industries have substantial impacts on the environment and society. This research 
can help industrial managers and planners develop strategies to overcome these barriers.

Abstract 
As society evolves to encompass new formats of mobile technologies. It can be observed in everyday resources such 
as vehicular mobile technologies. This is becoming increasingly evident and observable in resources such as driver 
assistance software, autonomous vehicles, navigation support, and driver security for accident prevention. To better 
understand user’s willingness to accept and subsequently adopt said automotive technologies, theoretical frameworks 
and acceptance models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Plan Behavior (TPB), Perceived 
Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) were utilized and reviewed throughout various studies. The 
outcome suggested that the more generalized, TAM was widely utilized and accepted in terms of predicting user 
willingness to accept and adopt mobile technology in vehicular settings.

Introduction  
The usage and utilization of technological resources have evolved throughout the last decade. It has expanded in 
various formats and catered to the needs of users in different walks of life. On a global level, users are expected to 
adhere to unforeseen changes brought forth by shifting climate and health conditions. Such changes include 
transporting themselves instead of shared traveling accommodations, and health concerns brought forth by global 
pandemic precautions due to the implications of COVID-19. The need for sustainable and accessible alternatives to 
such needs has become increasingly apparent throughout various facets of society (Tam et al. 2021).  
 Such concerns can be addressed through the product development and growth found in mobile technologies. Whilst 
often misconstrued or limited in terms of its perception. Mobile technologies have widely expanded in its outreach 
and overall growth as predicted by the implications of Moore’s law (Arpaci  2021). As a result, the need and therefore 
the dependency upon such technologies has grown to a newfound extent. Users vary in terms of their demographic 
and each demographic varies in terms of their needs. Based on a user’s background, their hierarchy of needs shifts 
depending upon the structure of their lives and means of living (Chen et al. 2013). For example, users who identify 
themselves as parents or caretakers may require technological resources that cater to their needs in childcare and or 
safety of their families (Burnett & Diels, 2018). In contrast to this, younger, more independently inclined users such 
as young adults or students may require financially resourceful alternatives (Park et al. 2011). Whereas single 
professional adults who work long hours or have fewer collaborative schedules but multiple tasks or objectives to tend 
to in their lives may need mobile technological resources that cater to their busy schedules and on-the-go lifestyles 
(Regan et al. 2018). Regardless of each user’s specific needs, the technology itself has grown and shifted to 
accommodate the diverse, versatile, and continuously expanding needs of its users.  
While this concept has primarily been notable in the evolution of computer-based resources, its mobility is now 
accessible and viable in various formats. This includes technology observed within automotive innovation. As the 
auto industry has sought to better accommodate its users’ needs and preferences, it has taken into consideration the 
growth of mobile technologies, the accessibility increases that have been brought forth throughout society with such 
growth, and how efficient it’s been (Regan et al. 2018). These changes can be observed in practical measures such as

  User demographic also continues to play an important role in the likelihood of technological adoption and acceptance 
(Sugandini et al., 2019). Users who are younger and or more equipped in terms of technology training and experience 
have displayed greater inclination toward utilizing vehicular technologies that gear users towards further autonomy 
and engagement (Saariluoma, 2020). While price ranges continue to be contingent upon the manufacturer’s make and 
model options, compared to previous iterations, many are opting to include information technology more accessible 
within base models of vehicles to draw consumers into investing in their vehicles (Abdi et al., 2022). Additionally, 
third party applications and tools which are compatible with such vehicles are now available for consumers to purchase 
independently and add on as they please (Ruddock, 2023). Furthermore, with the ongoing demand and expansion for 
autonomy throughout different sectors of technology, it is anticipated that it will be a prevalent issue amongst vehicle 
manufacturers as well (Mishra & Kumar, 2021).

 Overall, based on the outcomes presented in the approaches towards validation as seen in studies that observed the 
impact of user experience, in terms of potential stressors on adoption (Sugandini et al. 2019) and accepting newfound 
technologies within ongoing familiar sources of transportation (Kleidermacher, 2005), it should be noted that 
theoretical frameworks such as Technology Acceptance Models which observe the implications of perceived ease of 
use (Davis & Venkatesh, 2004) and consumer adoption of such technological expansions (Arts et al. 2011) bore 
similarities in their predictions. Such yields could further substantiate the exercise of such theories as the expansion 
of mobile technologies are further implemented in the growth of autonomous vehicles and user acceptance of 
information technologies within their vehicles. Overall, it has also been indicated that both computer technology and 
autonomous vehicular technology alike will double their performance capabilities every sixteen months (Olsen, 2019). 
Which can in turn, expand the capabilities of   Further research could explore the relationship between the predictions 
established in theories of user willingness to adopt technology regarding the steady progression of mobile technologies 
in vehicles identified in consumer feedback and financial growth within that sector.

Abstract 
Pollination is a crucial ecological process for the sustainment of both natural and agricultural systems. Approximately 
85% of flowering plants depend on animal pollinators for successful reproduction. Over 75% of global food crops 
rely on pollinators, making them indispensable for sustaining human populations. The pollination process is 
accomplished by wind, water, insects, birds, bats, mammals, amphibians, and mollusks.  The pollination process in 
angiosperms is robust because of the efficacious design features of flowers and pollinators. The axiomatic design 
offers a methodology to judge if a design is good or bad. This paper analyzes the design features of flowers and 
honeybees related to the pollination process. The functional requirements (FRs) of components of a flower and a 
honeybee are tabulated and mapped onto nature-chosen design parameters (DPs). The “independence axiom” of the 
axiomatic design methodology is applied to analyze couplings and to evaluate if the features of a flower and a 
honeybee form a good design (i.e., uncoupled design) or a bad design (i.e., coupled design). The analysis revealed that 
the flowers and honeybees are a good design to support pollination. This approach to judging whether nature’s entities 
are good or bad designs can be valuable for biomimicry studies. This approach can also be useful in teaching design 
considerations of biology and bio-inspired innovation.

1. Introduction
Pollination is a vital ecosystem service, required by 76% of global crops, and an estimated 87.5% of all flowering 
plants. The most important crop pollinator species globally is the western honeybee (Apis mellifera L.), enabling 
roughly 50% of global crop pollination. Honeybees pollinate about hundred or so plants such as strawberries, apples, 
pomegranates, beans, sunflowers, cotton, coffee plants, sesame, okra, and many more as presented by Pariona (2019).

5. Discussion and Conclusions 
 
In real-world designs, some DPs do multiple tasks. For example, a kitchen knife is used for peeling, cutting, 
chopping, dicing, slicing, mincing, separating tasks. Similarly, the mandibles of a honeybee located on the sides of 
the head act like a pair of pliers. The mandibles are used for any chores in a hive such as grasping or cutting wax to 
construct the comb, biting into flower parts (anthers) to release pollen, carrying detritus out of the hive, and gripping 
enemies during nest defense. In his case, many FRs are fulfilled by a single DP. This looks like a coupled design. 
Coupled designs are created when the number of DPs selected to satisfy a given set of FRs is less than the 
number of FRs. In an ideal design, the number of FRs and the number of DPs are the same. But a careful 
analysis will reveal that all FRs are not fulfilled at the same time. Honeybees use mandibles (single DP) to 
satisfy multiple FRs at different times. Therefore, it is not a coupled design, but an ideal design. 
 
Axiomatic design is a general design methodology that can be applied to evaluate the couplings of very small to very 
large systems. It can be applied to product design, service design, machine design, tooling design, software design, 
manufacturing system design, or logistics design. This paper focused only on the evaluation of the design features of 
a flower and a honeybee to test if the FRS and DPs are coupled or not. The analysis revealed that the anatomical 
features are uncoupled, and therefore it can be concluded that they are a good design.
