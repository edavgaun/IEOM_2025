Abstract 
The shipping sector is one of the major contributing factors to greenhouse gas emissions. As it is growing fast, shipping 
could produce 17% of global emissions by 2050 if it left unchecked. In this paper, we assess life cycle environmental 
impact of an aluminum patrol vessel of 25-meter size in Malaysia with the help of life cycle analysis (LCA) method. 
This paper also identifies the major hotspots of the life cycle impacts from the ship to examine the primary influential 
factors on environmental impact. Three main groups in the life cycle of the ship have been identified namely 
construction, operation, and disposal. In this analysis, this ship is considered to use the principle of cradle to grave 
that means this ship is built from raw materials and will be recycled after the ship is decommissioned. The results 
show that the operating part has given the highest value in climate change impact (GWP100) with 1.36048×108 kg 
CO2-Eq compared to the construction value in climate change impact (GWP100) with 1.70506×106 kg CO2-Eq.

1. Introduction
The shipping sector is one of the major contributing factors to greenhouse gases. According to International Maritime 
Organization (IMO), the shipping industry accounts for at least 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the sixth 
biggest in terms of total emissions share (Baldi et al. 2014). As it is growing fast, shipping could produce 17% of 
global emissions by 2050 if it left unchecked (Chen et al. 2019). Marine transport has been essential for international 
trade with about 90% of the world’s trade is carried by sea (Goldsworthy et al. 2019). In recent years, we have seen 
the growth of the ship in the shipping industry  (Ling-Chin and Roskilly 2016). The rapid increase of number merchant 
ship at sea causes the demand for raw material, fuel, and maintenance and also creates problem with the disposal for 
ship rack after ship was decommissioned (Sun et al. 2019).   
The concern for environment impacts was growing among the regulators, ship designers, classification society, ship 
owners and other stakeholders to make ship sector environmentally friendly using a variety of methods including life 
cycle assessment (LCA) method (Islam et al. 2016). Life cycle assessment is a comprehensive approach in which all 
processes involved in product creation from raw material acquisition through the final production, use, and disposal 
are analyzed. The effectiveness of the life cycle assessment (LCA) comes from its ability to provide a boundary 
assessment of the environmental impact on the product throughout its life cycle covering all phases (Bert Metz et al. 
2005). This paper evaluates life cycle impact of a 25-meter aluminum patrolling ship by using life cycle assessment 
(LCA) method with the help of OpenLCA software (OpenLCA 2021). This work identifies the major hotspot of the 
ship life cycle impact from construction to disposal.

4. Conclusions 
Ship industry mostly uses oil as the main fuel in generating propulsion by using combustion causes a lot of GHG 
emission that promotes climate change. shipping industry can cost a lot of energy and effect on environment. We can 
see the most problem of ship transport is associated with energy efficiency of ships.  It is important to improve the 
ship energy efficiency and reduce the ship emissions. Various emission reduction measures have been proposed to 
reduce the ship emissions. Fuel efficiency also make a lot of effect to environments and management cost. From the 
analysis, we see that the major hotspot for environmental effect comes from the operational process. The results show 
that the operating part has given the highest value in climate change impact (GWP100) with 1.36048×108 kg CO2-
Eq compared to the construction value in climate change impact (GWP100) with 1.70506×106 kg CO2-Eq.

Abstract 
Global food waste has become an increasingly important issue over the past decade given the alarming percentage of 
wastage that occurs specifically in the hospitality industry with much of this waste ending up in landfills. The 
environmental, economic, ethical, and social cost of this food waste to individuals, societies, and globally are 
significant. Recent research has tried to address this issue by identifying the reasons behind food waste and methods 
of reducing it by focusing on superficial behaviour change. The current study takes on a social practice approach and 
explores this potential superficiality in the Australian hospitality context by focusing on food service businesses. Data 
was primarily gathered through semi-structured interviews with actors from food service businesses (FSBs) ranging 
from fast food to high-end eateries. The findings illustrate the multiple practices pertaining to food waste (via a food 
waste process map), as well as highlighting the ways these practices are deep-rooted into social beliefs and norms.

and

in creating/managing food waste. Specifically, through social practice theory, the study contributes to strategies and 
actions that can be undertaken to collectively manage waste in the food service sector.

Abstract 
The popularity of YouTube has made watching videos entirely accessible to anyone. We now have not only the power 
to choose what we want to see, but also we can create it ourselves. An unavoidable aspect of the internet is the existence 
of YouTube rabbit holes.  Since 2005, that the video-sharing website went live, YouTube has seen the emergence of 
genres whose popularity was totally unanticipated and which would never have been thought of by conventional 
television networks. A new movement has evolved in recent years that may lack celebrities, spectacular reveals, or 
shock tactics etc. While gamers showing off their talents, obsessively detailed restaurant reviews, culinary skills, 
shouting conspiracy theories, and softly whispered serenades etc. have all reached mainstream success, this one trend 
has also gained significant traction. And this is the genre of ‘restoration videos’. It's just people taking rust-ridden, 
dust- and grime-ridden objects and carefully fixing them. There's a whole world of restoration videos on the YouTube, 
where individuals record themselves pulling an antique tool or other piece of machinery out of the trash. Similarly 
spectacle are the videos where old automobiles are given a new lease of life in a garage after a gruelling regime.  On 
YouTube, the restoration community has millions of views and likes in addition to multitudes of subscribers. Generally 
speaking, restoration can be divided into a few categories, such as toy repair, shoes, small machines, automobiles, 
consumer electronics, furniture, and tools, to name a few. The items restored on these channels feel quirky, exquisite, 
and distinctive in today's copycat environment, and much of this content is created at a very low cost. The story of an 
ugly, unwanted, and relatively dysfunctional object being given a second chance at life is both delightful and 
captivating. It also shares several characteristics with the category of videos known as autonomous sensory meridian 
response, or ASMR (Wikipedia, 2024). It is thus interesting to analyse why restoration videos are so popular? The 
paper discusses, setting of the research agenda to analyse the salient aspects of content consumption behaviour of 
YouTube restoration video viewers. Literature review shall be undertaken to identify the existence of academic and 
research based knowledge pool contextualized to this popular phenomenon. That shall help identify the research gap, 
research problem and thus the subsequent agenda for prospective research. The paper also discusses identifying 
suitable qualitative and/or quantitative studies that shall help address the research problem in order to understand the 
phenomenon of such distinct content consumption. This research agenda shall be helpful in identifying a structured 
approach to research the content consumption aspects of restoration videos, which in turn shall be useful to examine 
whether the constructs such as hypnotic quality (Open Culture, 2020), sustainability (Rhodri, 2019), vicarious 
satisfaction (Christopher, 2021) and auditory and visual stimuli (Trenholm et al, 2022), and/or some other behavioural 
motivations drive the viewing of restoration videos?

4. Conclusion and the Road Ahead 
The research agenda identified and discussed above shall be helpful in researching the content consumption aspects 
of YouTube restoration video viewers, which in turn shall be useful to examine whether the psychological constructs 
and/or some other behavioural motivations drive the viewing of restoration videos? This agenda shall be further shared 
and discussed with other researchers in a structured manner in order to identify refinements if required in the research 
methodology and/or any other aspects under discussion that may be needed to be studied in context with viewers’ 
content consumption of YouTube restoration videos.

Abstract 
Tool-work electrical contact resistance varies depending on the contact area between the tool and the workpiece. 
Specifically, as tool flank wear progresses, the contact electrical resistance reduces. This phenomenon is consistent 
with Holm's contact theory, even at high temperatures during cutting. We successfully measured tool-work electric 
contact resistance during intermittent cutting, where the cutting time per edge is short. In addition, we derived an 
equation to calculate flank wear width using the contact electrical resistance value. This enabled us to successfully 
determine flank wear width from the contact electrical resistance, albeit limited to cutting conditions with shallow 
depths of cut, such as finishing cuts. However, the current measurement method requires approximately 7 ms from 
the start of cutting to complete the measurement of contact electrical resistance. This time frame does not apply to 
tools with diameters less than 12 mm under standard cutting conditions when cutting carbon steel with cemented 
carbide tools. Within this 7-ms timeframe, overshoot of the waveform during the flow of constant current for 
measuring contact electrical resistance, as well as its decay time, have a significant effect on the measurement. In this 
study, we attempted to identify and suppress the causes of the overshoot. Although we identified the cause of 
overshoot, we were unable to identify the factors causing long decay times. Therefore, by altering the sequence of 
contact electrical resistance measurement, we successfully reduced the measurement time to 3 ms and made it 
compatible with measurements using smaller diameter tools.

Figure 15.  Relationship between depth of cut and tool-workpiece contact resistance for each method 
 
Comparing the results of these two methods revealed that measuring tool-work electrical contact resistance with the 
new sequence posed no issues. However, as previously stated, the new measurement sequence requires two spindle 
rotations to measure the tool-workpiece contact electrical resistance. However, this can be managed by carefully 
considering the timing of the Power MOSFET switch ON/OFF. Using the new measurement sequence, the previously 
required measurement time of 7 ms was reduced to 3 ms. Figure 16 shows the addition of the tool diameters that can 
be measured in 3 ms to Figure 7. For instance, in the case of 1/2 revolution machining at a cutting speed of V = 100 
m/min, the measurable target increased from tool diameters of 8 mm or more to 3.5 mm or more, whereas in 1/4 
revolution machining at the same cutting speed, the target increased from tool diameters of 15 mm or more to 6.5 mm 
or more. For example, when cutting similar to JIS SKD11 (ISO does not have an equivalent definition). which is 
commonly used in molds, the recommended cutting speed V is approximately V = 40 m/min. In this case, for 1/2 
revolution machining, the tool diameter should be 1.5 mm or more, and for 1/4 revolution machining it should be 3 
mm or more.

6. Conclusion 
Investigation into the cause of overshoot waveforms hindering reduction of measurement time during tool-work 
electrical contact resistance measurement. 
An investigation was carried out to determine the cause of the overshoot waveforms that were impeding the reduction 
of measurement time during tool-work electrical contact resistance measurements. The possible causes were assumed 
to be rotating contacts, DC amplifiers, or wiring inductance, and verification was performed accordingly. The results

revealed that the overshoot was caused by surge currents generated by the Power MOSFET switch and inductance. 
However, it was impossible to suppress it with countermeasures. Furthermore, the cause of the gradual decay after the 
overshoot could not be determined. Cutting with the constant current ON resulted in no overshoots or subsequent 
decay owing to switching. Using this result, the measurement sequence was modified, albeit with measurements taken 
every two spindle rotations, reducing the measurement time for tool-workpiece contact electrical resistance from 7 to 
3 ms. As a result, the range of measurable tool diameters was expanded to include smaller sizes.

Abstract 
In this study, we aim to develop a data-driven and personalized retail marketing system based on the relationship 
between each product and its transaction behaviour. This research will further analyze the correlation between 
products' transaction histories and customer preferences to refine the personalized retailing system. We segment 
customer-purchasing behaviour using clustering to enable these characteristics in our retail marketing system. We 
used correlation analysis and experimental design to engineer and select features. Association rules were used to 
identify causal associations on a transaction dataset that had already been split based on quartile time horizon and 
customer-purchasing group. The Network Analysis revealed that the VIPs' transactions were more complex than the 
Potential Customers', meaning that the VIPs' patterns of purchases were more random, and the Potential Customers 
were grouped. Potential customer transactions are clustered into small groups, whereas VIP transactions are scattered. 
In Main Path Analysis, the products' core paths are plotted, and the biggest accumulative weight on the graph is 
eliminated, along with other insignificant associations. An association's critical path analysis determines the most 
important path. However, since we use historical data for empirical research, real-world datasets should be used to 
apply our findings for a comprehensive assessment.

Abstract 
This paper discusses optimization of the Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP) under uncertainty in demand 
and supply. This research proposes an optimization framework that addresses the capacitated facility location problem 
by considering delivery companies to identify optimal warehouse locations so that orders are met at the lowest cost 
depending on warehouse capacity.  This research was applied to the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with high 
demand for delivery; therefore, census data were taken in the cities available for study, and a small proportion of each 
city was customers.  A novel mixed integer linear programming was proposed and solved by Python to obtain the 
minimum total transportation and fixed costs for warehouse construction. The proposed warehouse sites were 
presented on a map, and each city was connected to its optimal warehouse. This research investigates the effects of 
determining the optimal warehouse sites for supplying goods to different cities in Saudi Arabia with high demand. 
This paper addressed one of the major problems that most companies face, namely, the Capacitated Facility Locations 
Problem (CFLP). A Python language based on different libraries was used to solve the problem, and the results were 
obtained. The results revealed that there were 19 proposed sites distributed throughout Saudi Arabia for constructing 
warehouses, which could meet customer demands and minimize transportation costs. The results also demonstrate 
that optimal warehouse sites can save money, decrease undesirable transportation and inventory costs, and satisfy 
customer requirements.

Abstract 
Aktas found a non-linear relationship between working capital management (WCM) and profitability when the 
industry median of the WCM indicator was used as the target. This implies a relatively negative relationship between 
WCM and profitability in firms with excess working capital and a relatively positive one in firms with working capital 
less than the industry median. However, there are two limitations to the aforementioned study. First, it used only the 
industry median as an indicator to test the non-linearity of the relationship between WCM and profitability. Second, 
it did not consider socially influential events, such as COVID-19. Therefore, this study had two objectives. The first 
is to verify the results obtained when the analysis is conducted for Japanese firms using a non-linear model and 
including the period during which COVID-19 occurred. Second, we test whether the relationship between WCM and 
profitability is non-linear using the industry mean as an indicator along with the industry median. We use a non-linear 
model to analyse the financial data of companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2022, which 
includes the COVID-19 period. The results are similar to those of a previous study, which used the industry median 
for the WCM indicator as the target. However, the analysis using the industry mean for WCM indicators as targets 
did not yield significant results. This is because some industries had unusual amounts of working capital because of 
the impact of COVID-19. 
Keywords

Abstract 
Most Japanese listed companies announce earnings forecasts by the CEOs (referred to as ‘management forecasts’). 
Management forecasts are particularly important for investors' decision-making because they are published by 
managers with inside information. What heuristic decisions do investors make when management forecasts are used? 
Prior studies examined the decisions of investors who received information on the five-year management forecast EPS 
achievement rate and five-year earnings surprise (management forecast EPS–actual EPS). However, the trend status 
of the actual EPS and management forecasted EPS has not been studied. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a 4×3 
online experiment on the 4 types of trend status of the 3 periods of ‘always increasing’, ‘always decreasing’, ‘down 
then up’, or ‘up then down’, and 3 types of final year achievement status: achieved, not achieved, and not stated. The 
participants were 600 Japanese stock investors asked to evaluate stock valuation, prospects, reliability, and EPS for 
the next period to test how they make heuristic judgments. The ANOVA results show that judgments were made by 
looking at the trend only (p<.001) for stock valuation, prospects, trustworthiness, and EPS for the next period. It was 
also evident that decisions based on the management's EPS forecast achievement (p<.07) were made only on a 
decreasing trend. These results suggest that management should emphasise the trend when the actual EPS is upward 
and show the achievement status when it is downward for investors to perceive their company as an attractive 
investment target.

Abstract 
Accounting fraud is the intentional material misstatement of financial statements or disclosures (in notes to financial 
statements or SEC filings), or the commission of an illegal act that has a direct material effect on financial statements 
or financial disclosures. Accounting fraud reduces public confidence in capital markets and impedes economic 
development. Studies are underway to develop a model for detecting accounting fraud using the descriptions in Form 
10-K and other reports. This is because researchers believe that by identifying linguistic patterns that mask accounting
fraud, a fraud-detection model with high detection accuracy can be built. This study examines the linguistic
characteristics that occur when accounting fraud is committed within the text of the MD&A section of an annual
securities report, constructs a fraud-detection model, and evaluates its effectiveness. Based on interpersonal deception
theory, we hypothesize that during accounting fraud periods, managers do not refer to their company's business
conditions in detail and use more general language, thus reducing word specificity. The results of measuring
vocabulary specificity using Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), which calculates word scarcity, demonstrated that
IDF was lower during the accounting fraud period than during the non-fraudulent accounting period. This indicated a
significant decrease in vocabulary specificity. Based on these results, we constructed a model for accounting fraud
detection using IDF-weighted features and found that the detection accuracy improved.

Abstract 
Traditionally, automation has been leveraged extensively in larger warehouses to streamline processes, reduce human 
error, and increase productivity. However, small-scale warehouses face unique challenges that complicate the adoption 
of such technologies. This research is structured around three critical questions: Firstly, it delves into the specific 
challenges these warehouses encounter in adopting automation. Secondly, it assesses the impact of various automation 
technologies, such as AGV robots, barcode systems, and OCR scanners, on improving efficiency and productivity. 
Thirdly, it explores effective strategies and best practices for seamlessly integrating these technologies into existing 
operations. By employing a comprehensive research methodology that includes surveys, interviews, observations, and 
leveraging the researcher's hands-on experience as a warehouse specialist, the study provides insightful analyses into 
the automation landscape for small-scale warehouses. The findings highlight significant barriers such as inadequate 
funding and disparities in access to technology, despite the pivotal role these facilities play in the logistics sector. The 
study proposes that government incentives or subsidies could facilitate a more equitable adoption of automation 
technologies. These insights offer practical recommendations for policymakers and warehouse owners, aiming to 
foster more efficient, less labor-intensive, and technologically advanced operations within these crucial logistics hubs.

1. Introduction
Within the domain of warehouse operations, a lack of cutting-edge technologies frequently deprives small-scale 
facilities of the benefits that these innovations offer to improve operational efficiency. This evident disparity often 
originates from a variety of constraints, including financial limitations and challenges related to the allocation of 
resources (Horvath and Szabo, 2019). Therefore, smaller warehouses frequently fall behind their larger counterparts 
in adopting sophisticated technologies for their operations. 
Undoubtedly warehousing is the essence of logistics. This assertion finds strong support in the data in Figure 1, which 
highlights the pivotal role of warehousing and storage within the broader logistics landscape. When examining the 
data through a quarter-on-quarter lens, it becomes evident that there has been a notable increase of 1.1% in the context 
39","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

to directly address the current needs. Furthermore, the study takes a comprehensive approach by examining various 
aspects of automation adoption, including challenges, benefits, and strategies for successful implementation. This 
ensures that the study offers a comprehensive grasp of the issue at hand.  
 
Additionally, given that the survey questions are aligned with current industry advancements, specifically the adoption 
of concepts from Industry 4.0 and the integration of automation technologies. Along with practicality and realism, the 
proposed solutions too, address the challenges identified in the survey questions in a manner that can be readily 
implemented by enterprises.  Lastly, the study's findings and recommendations have broad applicability, extending 
their relevance to a wide range of small and middle-scale logistics and warehousing enterprises. 
 
Nonetheless, there are too, flaws worth considering. First, the possibility of sampling bias. Sample of respondents has 
a major influence on the study's conclusions. If this sample is not representative of the entire population of small and 
middle-scale logistics and warehousing enterprises, the study's generalizability may be limited. Furthermore, many 
survey questions rely on the views and judgements subjected to respondents. Although these insights are useful, there's 
a likelihood that they might insinuate elements of subjectivity and even bias into the answers. 
 
The study's primary reliance on survey data, a single form of data gathering. he exclusive use of this method may 
constrain the depth of insights that can be gained. Finally, the study did not deeply explore the specifics of 
implementation and the potential hurdles that may be encountered during the execution of the proposed solutions. 
 
Moreover, it is imperative to acknowledge specific limitations. Firstly, the study's findings and recommendations are 
subject to the fast-paced evolution of technology and industry trends. This inherent time sensitivity implies that the 
applicability of the suggested solutions may wane over time if they are not continually revised and tailored to adapt 
to evolving circumstances. Secondly, the generalizability of the study's findings may have constraints rooted in the 
context and the sample used for the survey. It is plausible that the results may not universally apply to all small and 
middle-scale logistics and warehousing enterprises. Additionally, the implementation of the proposed solutions might 
face limitations due to the availability of resources, including financial, technological, and a skilled workforce. The 
market dynamics, governmental regulations, and economic conditions are examples of external elements that can 
affect the effectiveness of automation technology implementation. These outside variables may affect how 
successfully the suggested remedies work and are outside of the enterprises' control. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this project has effectively addressed the research questions and has successfully achieved the research 
objectives. The analysis of survey data have yielded valuable insights into the formidable challenges encountered by 
small-scale warehouses as they strive to implement automation for optimizing their processes. 
 
Chief among these challenges is the substantial financial burden that often obstructs the adoption of automation 
solutions in small-scale warehouses. These establishments frequently grapple with limited capital and investment 
capacity, serving as a significant impediment. Our findings have shed light on potential solutions, including 
government intervention and the imperative need for pilot runs. Pilot tests have proven to be instrumental in shifting 
prevailing mindsets and facilitating the transition towards automation. 
 
Furthermore, our research has delved deeply into the contribution of various automation technologies towards 
enhancing efficiency and productivity within small-scale warehouses. Despite the prominent barriers, especially the 
challenge of securing adequate funding, our study underscores the critical need to extend opportunities and trust to 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This empowerment is crucial for SMEs to make meaningful contributions to 
economic growth and transformation. A compelling aspect that has emerged is the remarkable synergy among barcode 
scanners, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), and OCR scanners. These technologies effectively complement each 
other, streamlining processes within small-scale warehouses and delivering tangible benefits. The collaborative 
approach optimizes inventory management, enhances order fulfillment accuracy, and reduces operational costs. 
 
Our exploration of effective strategies and best practices for implementing automation in small-scale warehouses has 
also provided essential insights. The survey results underscore the significance of conducting pilot tests to assess the 
feasibility and benefits of automation. Furthermore, reskilling and educating employees are vital components of 
successful automation adoption. Providing the workforce with technological knowledge ensures they can leverage

automation tools for maximum efficiency. To maintain competitiveness, it is imperative to provide continuous 
education and regular training to keep employees updated with current technology trends. 
The primary findings of this project underscore the persistent challenges of funding and the essential need for 
technological knowledge, even within Singapore's high-tech and advanced landscape. While it presented some 
difficulty in finding survey respondents favorably inclined towards our findings, their responses have been invaluable 
in shaping our conclusions. 
Further studies should consider a Comparative Analysis of Warehouse Management Systems, where a detailed 
evaluation of different systems, including SAP Business One, can provide insights into their efficiency and 
applicability within small and middle-scale warehouses. Understanding their performance in varying operational 
contexts is critical for informed decision-making. Expanding the scope to a global perspective on small and middle-
scale warehouses is another promising avenue. By comparing warehouse operations across different countries and 
evaluating the adoption and influence of automation and Industry 4.0 technologies, researchers can unveil regional 
variations and best practices. This broader view contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of global logistics 
trends. Addressing these areas can contribute to the ongoing evolution and enhancement of warehouse operations in 
an increasingly technology-driven world. 
While these suggestions can significantly enrich the field of study, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations faced in 
the current research. Due to time constraints, the pool of respondents could not be expanded as desired, potentially 
impacting the comprehensiveness of the findings. Additionally, a digital twin model can be explored to incorporate 
real-life scenarios to enhance its real-world applicability. These avenues for future study can address these limitations 
and offer a more extensive understanding of the complex logistics landscape.

Abstract 
This explanatory research seeks to investigate what drives pineapple output growth in Northern Mindanao from a 
socio-economic perspective. The study attempts to analyse the socio-economic determinants at two levels, namely, 
individual farm owners and MNEs operating in the top pineapple producing region in the country. The research 
methodology entails a sequential mixed-methods design combining survey, case study, extensive desk reviews, and 
triangulation of the results to provide a comprehensive study. The underpinnings of resource dependency theory, 
stakeholder theory, and institutional theory provide a solid theoretical framework for the study. The study aims to 
investigate what predisposes individual farm owners to engage in pineapple cultivation and how the 
interorganizational relationship or interplay between MNEs and the individual farm owners, the influence of 
cooperatives and/or farmers associations, and the government support impact pineapple output growth. By gaining 
understanding of the challenges and vulnerabilities in pineapple production, the study can provide inputs for potential 
policy interventions to enhance pineapple output growth and empower farmers and MNEs to ensure generational 
renewal of pineapple cultivation in the Philippines. This study also contributes to the evidence-based evaluation of 
how farm owners directly or indirectly pursue economic opportunities, contribute to food security, and help influence 
sustainable economic growth in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal.

The proposed framework that is underpinned by an integration of three theoretical lenses: - resource dependency 
theory, stakeholder theory, and institutional theory, is believed to be one of the first studies that do so in the scope of 
this research.  It is also potentially one of the few mixed-method studies involving primary and secondary data that 
seek to offer a nuanced understanding of the interplay among the stakeholders from a socio-economic perspective in 
a duopsony set-up that is scarcely researched.

Abstract 
The agro-export sector for fruits, especially blueberries, is crucial to the global and Latin American economies, 
particularly in Peru. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains and international demand, 
highlighting the need for improved efficiency and resilience through methodologies such as Lean Manufacturing and 
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). The main challenges include prolonged machine setup times, operational errors, 
and equipment failures, negatively impacting overall equipment efficiency (OEE). These issues result in delays and 
high costs, affecting product quality. Optimizing these processes is urgent to ensure the sector's sustainability and 
competitiveness. The proposed model integrates Lean Manufacturing and TPM tools, implementing strategies like 
SMED, autonomous and preventive maintenance, and work standardization. These actions aimed to reduce setup 
times, improve machine availability, and standardize procedures. Training personnel and constantly reviewing 
indicators were essential for the model's success. The results showed a 45% reduction in setup time, a 43% increase 
in overall equipment efficiency, and a 36% improvement in machine availability. These findings demonstrated the 
model's effectiveness in enhancing productivity and operational efficiency in the blueberry production line. This 
research significantly impacts academia and the agro-export industry by providing a replicable model that improves 
competitiveness and ensures long-term quality and sustainability. Researchers and professionals are encouraged to 
explore new optimization strategies, focusing on continuous improvement to address future challenges and foster 
sector growth.

1. Introduction
The agro-export sector, particularly concerning fruits like blueberries, plays a vital role globally, in Latin America, 
and specifically in countries like Peru. The demand for these products has faced significant challenges due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, leading to disruptions in supply chains and a decrease in international demand (López-Ridaura 
et al., 2021). This sector's importance lies not only in its economic contributions but also in its role in providing 
livelihoods for many agricultural entrepreneurs in the region. The impact of the pandemic on farming systems has

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of the study revealed that the implementation of the proposed model, which integrates Lean 
Manufacturing tools and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), resulted in significant improvements in the operational 
efficiency of the blueberry production line. Specifically, a 45% reduction in setup time, a 43% increase in Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), and a 36% improvement in machine availability were observed. These results were 
validated through quantitative indicators that demonstrated a notable reduction in downtime and an optimization of 
operational processes, reflecting the feasibility and effectiveness of the implemented model. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its ability to address critical issues in the agro-export sector, a vital component 
of the Peruvian and global economies. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant vulnerabilities in supply chains 
and international demand, highlighting the need to improve the resilience and efficiency of production processes. This 
research provides a robust and proven model that not only enhances the competitiveness of agro-export companies in 
the global market but also ensures the long-term sustainability of the sector through the implementation of innovative 
and efficient methodologies. 
 
This study makes significant contributions to the field of industrial engineering. The proposed model effectively 
combines Lean Manufacturing and TPM methodologies, providing a comprehensive approach to the continuous 
improvement of production processes. The research demonstrates how these tools can be specifically adapted and

applied in the context of agro-industrial production, offering practical guidance for implementing improvements in 
other companies in the sector. Additionally, the study enriches existing literature by providing empirical evidence of 
the quantifiable benefits of these methodologies in a real production environment. 
 
In the final observations, the need for deeper and broader studies to explore the applicability of the model in other 
contexts and production sectors is emphasized. The implementation of continuous improvement cycles (Kaizen) is 
suggested to maintain and expand the obtained benefits. Furthermore, greater investment in personnel training and the 
acquisition of advanced technologies that can complement and enhance improvement efforts is recommended. This 
study provides a solid foundation for future research and practical applications, encouraging researchers and 
professionals to continue exploring and developing innovative strategies to optimize production processes in the agro-
export sector.

Abstract 
A recent analysis of e-waste market flow and technology trends identified solar (PV) panels as the fastest growing e-
waste stream in Australia in the coming years owing to the ongoing boom in the installation of PV systems over the 
last 10 years. As a rapidly emerging e-waste stream with absence of local processing options, there is a need to 
develop strategies and approaches to manage this e-waste stream to prevent them from ending up in landfills.  As the 
quantity of this waste stream is rising, there is increasing concern from local governments, state and federal 
governments and industry on the insufficient management options to safely dispose of end-of-life PV system 
components across Australia and a lack of established re-processors and recyclers capable of recovering valuable 
resources. This study aims to examine the growing issues on PV system waste management and disposal in 
Australia and the way forward. The study will identify the issues and challenges associated with solar panel waste 
disposal and develop innovative approaches to address its collection and recycling in Australia. This study adopts 
both quantitative and qualitative research approaches involving online survey questionnaires and semi-structured 
interviews. The study interviews employees of metropolitan and regional councils, and surveys residents and 
businesses in the communities. Based on the outcomes of this study, practical approaches on the way forward are 
recommended. The study provides real-world suggestions for dealing with the growing issues on PV system waste 
management in Australia. From a practical perspective; this study will be useful to metropolitan and regional 
councils, environmentalists, policy makers, researchers and organizations in developing appropriate recycling 
strategies and schemes for addressing the ongoing concerns on PV system waste management in Australia.

Abstract 
Electronic waste commonly known as e-waste is among the fastest growing waste streams and has remained both a 
local and a global problem. Consequently, efficient management of e-waste has become a concern due to increasing 
urbanization, population growth and early obsolescence of electrical and electronic equipment. In Australia alone, it 
is estimated that more than 44 million tons of e-waste mainly from computers, laptops, television and mobile phones 
will be disposed of by 2028. This creates enormous environmental and health risks due to inappropriate recycling 
and disposal practices. This warrants the need to develop innovative approaches to address e-waste collection and 
recycling practices using technological innovations such as blockchain technology. Blockchain technology has the 
potential to substitute the slow manual processes used in e-waste management through creating digital asset token 
(e.g. security token) associated with e-waste tracking and tracing, and preventing e-waste ending up in landfills. This 
study aims to examine how blockchain technology can be used in the automation of processes for achieving 
sustainable e-waste management practices in Australia. The detailed processes involved in the implementation of 
blockchain technology for tracing, tracking and transparent e-waste management is examined. This study adopts a 
qualitative research method and employs semi-structured interviews of managers of local governments with 
responsibilities of managing e-waste. The findings of this study will significantly assist government agencies, 
industry, researchers, and other e-waste management agencies in reducing e-waste management costs and

Abstract 
This paper is a practical example of utilizing Game Theory for effective Consensus Decision Making. In today’s ever 
increasingly multifaceted world, there is an essential need for complex decisions to be resolved in a responsible 
optimum manner. The solution process needs to be suitably applied, that appropriately resolves the issue.  In most 
cases, utilising Industrial Engineering (IE) Techniques will result in suitable outcomes.  The decision requirements 
can include personal, business, governance, bureaucratic, environmental, technical and other outcomes, that require 
resolutions that may have short-, medium- or long-term impacts. Industrial Engineering Practices such as Consensus 
Decision Making (CDM) utilizing Game Theory (GT), can be utilized effectively, that can in most cases lead to 
optimal conclusions that benefit collectively in a Holistic manner. It should be noted that GT leads to optimized 
solutions and NOT to universally accepted outcomes in some cases. Due to circumstances, the need for effective 
consensus decision requirements is a major challenge. This is mainly due to the participants varying vested interests, 
backgrounds etc. This can lead to conflict or disagreement. The challenge then becomes how best to solve the 
challenges for optimum outcomes that satisfy all or the majority of the parties involved to a greater extent. A solution 
is the introduction of Consensus Decision Making Utilising Game Theory. Consensus Decision Making allows for a 
positive methodology, treating all participants equally, leading to meaningful agreements for the group. 
Keywords 
Consensus, Decision, Benefit, Conflict, Optimum. 
1. Introduction
In our society, respectful agreement is the norm for a multitude of various situations. These could include normal daily 
activities such as domestic circumstances, purchasing items in a store, business decisions in the workplace, authority 
decrees or even international differences.  
1.
Consensus Decision Making is a creative and dynamic way of reaching agreement between all or most
members of a group. Instead of simply voting for an item and having the majority of the group getting their
way, a group using consensus is committed to finding solutions that everyone actively supports, or at least
can live with (Seed, 2022). (www.seedsforchange.org.uk)
The need for an appropriate outcome, hopefully for all interested parties, is the ultimate state of affairs. 
By utilising effective communication techniques holistically, Industrial Engineers (IE) are able to successfully achieve 
effective outcomes benefiting organisations and even individuals in their daily lives 
Traditionally decisions are usually made unilaterally (top down organisations), dictatorially (dictatorships or strong 
organisations or strong personalities) or by senior management or rubber stamped (weak democracies following strong 
leaders)

7. Conclusion 
In conclusion “concepts of game theory permit a wide range of applications, at the same time they are selectively 
useful in solving problems of a certain type, in drawing attention to certain features of a problem, and in reaching 
certain types of conclusions.” (Martin, 1978).

The need for a suitable methodology allowing for the resolution of many simple or complex issues allowing for 
acceptable agreement is essential. An applicable Industrial Engineering technique that facilitates effective Consensus 
Decision Making is the utilization of Game Theory developed by John. 
It should be noted that Game Theory may not lead to Universal acceptance in the decision making process in all cases. 
However, Game Theory when utilized effectively, usually leads to optimum solutions. These outcomes can be 
acceptable to all or most of the participants in many cases.

Abstract 
We investigate the application of machine learning techniques to predict student enrollment rates at Turkish foundation 
universities. In this study, prediction was made with three different algorithms: multiple linear regression, decision 
tree, and random forest. The model used historically collected data to accurately forecast future enrollment rates and 
delivers useful findings for optimizations within the area of university institutions. Key factors taken into consideration 
by foundation universities in Turkey in the process of determining student registrations and capacity of departments 
were examined. A number of variables affect the success criteria, and benchmarks set to evaluate how well these 
variables perform. In general, the practical use of machine learning in enrollment estimation was discussed in the 
project and an enrollment forecast was made for the 2024-2025 academic year. It was emphasized that foundation 
universities should benefit from machine learning to increase efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and enable 
relevant managers to make better decisions and develop strategies.

1. Introduction
Student enrolment rate is an important performance indicator of colleges' long-term academic and financial stability. 
The main aim of this research project is to develop a stable and accurate machine learning model that can predict the 
enrollment rates of private universities in Turkey. It allows universities to identify enrollment trends over time and 
identify potential bottlenecks, guiding the institution toward more efficient and effective student enrollment and 
institutional management. 
Upon a successful project accomplishment, subsequent objectives listed below are fulfilled:

© IEOM Society International 
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The Random Forest model got the lowest average MSE (0.1059), followed by Decision 
Tree (0.1092) and Linear Regression (0.1192). The smaller MSE value operation integrates, the better and near 
accurate prediction the model provides. Lower MSE values indicate that the Random Forest and Decision Tree models 
are better at minimizing error variance. 
 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The Decision Tree got the lowest average MAE (0.1782), followed closely by 
Random Forest (0.1802) and Linear Regression (0.1888). MAE measures average error magnitude, indicating that the 
Decision Tree and Random Forest models are more accurate overall. 
 
Yearly predictions and errors outputs: 
For 2023, all models got a low MSE and MAE values, with Random Forest and Decision Tree slightly outperforming 
Linear Regression. (linear regression got highest error values) 
Random Forest consistently got the lowest errors in 2022 and 2020, demonstrating its robustness and lowest bias over 
the years. 
In 2021, despite all models having higher error rates, Decision Tree and Random Forest outperformed Linear 
Regression similarly with 2023.  
 
Based on a comparison and contrast of average predicted enrollment rates and error metrics (MSE and MAE), the 
Random Forest algorithm was found to be the best model for predicting enrollment rates in Turkey's foundation 
universities. Its higher average predicted successfully estimated and targeted enrollment rate, combined with lower 
MSE and MAE values, demonstrates its superior ability to model complex relationships in the data. Furthermore, the 
Random Forest model's consistency and accuracy across years reinforces its reliability as a predictive tool. 
 
Additionally, when compared to other models used, decision tree and linear regression, the Random Forest approach 
was the most effective, lowest MSE, near accurate targeted predictions with higher accuracy and stability in predicting 
enrollment rates. The Decision Tree model was insightful and interpretable, but it lacked the robustness of the Random 
Forest and contained low bias. Ensemble methods, particularly the Random Forest, improve predictive performance 
dramatically by combining the strengths of multiple weak learners. These machine learning models offer valuable and 
precious insights into the factors that influence student enrollment, allowing universities to tailor their strategies more 
effectively. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The goal of this research is to create a machine learning model that can forecast enrollment rates in Turkey's foundation 
universities. Universities will be better able to manage student enrollment and institutional resources by using this 
information to identify enrollment trends and possible bottlenecks. Optimizing predictions of university enrollments, 
managing resources as efficiently as possible, strengthening decision-making procedures, and utilizing long-term 
financial and strategic planning capacities are the objectives of the project. Additionally, the model will support hiring 
staff, developing infrastructure, and organizing student capacity. 
 
Several studies that have forecast enrollment in schools have been thoroughly examined, providing insight into the 
various methods used in the literature review section. The review showed the implementation of several complex 
algorithms, including advanced neural networks to traditional regression models, along with various data sets, some 
comprising studies with a wide range of criteria, from socioeconomic aspects to historical record trends. 
 
Our results reveal that the Random Forest algorithm is the best-performing model for predicting enrollment rates in 
foundation universities in Turkey, offering higher accuracy and stability. Its durability across different years and 
ability to model complex relationships within data make it a valuable predictive tool. Methods, particularly Random 
Forest, enhance predictive performance by leveraging multiple learners, making it recommended for effective 
educational planning and resource allocation.

Abstract 
The textile industry is a major contributor to the global economy, particularly significant in Peru due to its rich history 
and traditional techniques. This sector not only provides substantial employment but also preserves cultural heritage 
and drives economic growth. Despite its importance, the Peruvian textile industry faces operational inefficiencies, 
particularly in machinery setup during product transitions, leading to high unproductive times and reduced outputs. 
Addressing these issues is critical for maintaining competitiveness and meeting industry standards. The proposed 
study introduced a Lean Manufacturing-based model to tackle these inefficiencies. The model integrated Systematic 
Layout Planning (SLP), 5S methodology, and Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) techniques. SLP was 
employed to optimize plant layout, reducing transportation times and improving workflow. The 5S methodology 
aimed to create an organized and clean work environment, enhancing process stabilization. SMED focused on 
reducing machinery setup times, increasing production flexibility and responsiveness. The implementation of this 
model resulted in significant improvements. The Operational Efficiency Index increased from 83.4% to levels nearing 
the industry standard of 95%. Setup times were reduced by 49.80%, and transportation times between areas decreased 
by 53.81%. These improvements led to a notable economic impact, reducing annual losses and enhancing overall 
productivity and efficiency within the production process. Academically, this research contributed valuable insights 
into the application of Lean Manufacturing tools in the textile sector, a relatively underexplored area. 
Socioeconomically, the findings highlighted the potential for substantial gains in productivity and efficiency, 
promoting sustainable growth and competitiveness in the market. This study underscores the importance of continuous 
improvement and invites further exploration into innovative methodologies to enhance operational efficiency. Future 
research should focus on expanding the application of Lean tools and exploring their integration with Industry 4.0 
technologies to further optimize textile production processes.

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of this study demonstrate that the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools, such as SMED, 5S, 
and Systematic Layout Planning, can significantly enhance operational efficiency in the textile sector. Internal 
activities were identified and transformed into external ones, and non-value-added tasks were eliminated, resulting in 
a reduction of setup time for spinning and warping machinery from 00:45:18 hours to 00:18:34 hours and from 
00:36:48 hours to 00:25:12 hours, respectively. Additionally, a 40.82% improvement in the operational efficiency 
index was observed, increasing from 53.40% to 75.20%. These results highlight the effectiveness of a systematic 
approach to addressing inefficiencies in production processes, providing a robust foundation for continuous 
improvement in textile companies. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its ability to offer practical and effective solutions to common operational 
challenges in the textile industry. Improving operational efficiency not only contributes to cost and production time 
reductions but also enhances the competitiveness of companies in a globalized market. Moreover, the implementation 
of Lean Manufacturing methodologies promotes a safer and more organized work environment, which can lead to 
higher employee satisfaction and productivity. By addressing the root causes of inefficiencies, this study provides a 
valuable framework for textile companies aiming to optimize their processes and achieve sustainable long-term 
performance. 
 
This study's contributions to the field of industrial engineering are significant, as they expand knowledge on the 
application of Lean Manufacturing in the textile industry. Unlike previous research, this study focuses on the specific 
context of small and medium-sized textile enterprises (SMEs) in Peru, offering a model tailored to their needs and 
limitations. The integration of tools like SMED and 5S with Systematic Layout Planning provides a holistic approach 
that can be replicated in other industrial sectors with similar characteristics. Furthermore, the findings of this study 
underscore the importance of meticulous planning and execution to achieve substantial improvements in operational 
efficiency, providing valuable insights that can be utilized by academics and practitioners to develop new optimization 
strategies in various industrial contexts. 
 
The final observations of this study suggest that, although significant improvements in operational efficiency were 
achieved, there are opportunities for future research to delve deeper into the optimization of other aspects of the 
production process. It would be beneficial to investigate the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies with Lean 
methodologies to explore new forms of automation and real-time data analysis. Additionally, assessing the long-term 
impacts of these improvements on the sustainability and resilience of textile companies could provide further insights 
into the effectiveness of these strategies. Finally, comparative studies across different industries are recommended to 
identify best practices and adapt Lean methodologies to diverse production environments, thereby contributing to the 
continuous advancement of operational efficiency in industrial engineering.

Abstract 
Many companies are incorporating supply chain platforms into their business models to remain competitive in 
today's market. The trend is also evident in Singapore, as the country embraces digital transformation to become a 
leading smart nation. The adoption of supply chain technologies across different companies and industries is 
becoming ubiquitous. This research explores the dynamic landscape of such technological adoption by first 
delineating the distinctions between supply chain systems, supply chain software, and supply chain platforms. 
Clarifying distinctions can guide companies in navigating the differences and investigating the complexities 
associated with each. At large contributing to effective supply chain operations management and strategic 
collaboration across industries. An exploratory case study is conducted to inspect perceptions and attitudes towards 
the adoption of supply chain platforms in the local context. A combination of data collection techniques is used to 
gather qualitative and quantitative information. Companies of various sizes and backgrounds are considered, and 
employees at different levels – yet with exposure to the company’s supply chain – are interviewed. Findings indicate 
a widespread awareness of different types of supply chain platforms among employees in Singapore, and consensus 
perceives that the platforms can provide long-term benefits to the company, mainly by improving innovation, 
competitiveness, and communication. The findings are presented using a SOAR (Strengths, Opportunities, 
Aspirations, and Results) analysis, and, where possible, options to overcome barriers, promote the adoption, and 
capitalise on the benefits of supply chain platforms are discussed. The study, with its practical implications, finally 
recommends a framework that companies can follow to assess and facilitate the readiness for adopting supply chain 
platforms. These practical recommendations can facilitate informed decisions within companies. Additionally, 
taking valuable lessons from the Singapore context, other countries can consider the findings highlighted herein and 
review their application in various contexts. Comparisons and contrasts are crucial for advancing the adoption of 
technology in supply chains and ensuring that companies are well-prepared to navigate the evolving landscape of 
supply chain management and operations.

6. Conclusion 
This study differentiates the concepts of software, platforms, and systems in the evolving landscape of supply chain 
operations and management. Supply chain platforms provide an integrated environment fostering collaboration and 
scalability and are becoming increasingly popular among companies in Singapore as the country embraces digital 
transformation to become a leading smart nation. This study investigated employees' attitudes towards the adoption 
of supply chain platforms using a mixed methods approach to gather data and represent the perspectives using a 
SOAR analysis matrix. Responses reveal awareness of supply chain platforms in Singapore and an overall positive 
perception of them, emphasising the potential that they have for improving operational efficiency, innovation, and 
decision-making. Employees are generally open to learning and using the platforms, provided there is adequate 
support in terms of training, communication, and risk management – which are opportunities that companies should 
exploit. IT readiness, financial considerations, and return on investment are crucial factors for consideration for the 
successful adoption of supply chain platforms. Companies could leverage these insights following the proposed 
supply chain adoption readiness framework. The framework suggests conducting an assessment and tailoring action 
plans so that companies can systematically prepare for the integration of supply chain platforms. These should be 
accompanied by communication and a support system so that employees and decision-makers can work together to 
maximise the derived benefits.  
 
Although this framework is based on the Singapore context, its principles can be adapted to different countries by 
taking into account the local market dynamics and regulatory conditions. It should be noted that the SOAR analysis 
used in this research focuses on strengths and opportunities, omitting possible weaknesses and threats that could 
impact the adoption process of supply chain platforms. Additionally, the findings primarily reflect the perspectives 
of employees, without considering the views of partners, customers, or other key stakeholders. Future research 
should aim to incorporate these broader perspectives for a more holistic understanding of the factors influencing 
supply chain platform adoption.

Abstract 
Does the management adjust its tone in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section in response to 
performance? This study aims to determine whether there are differences in the tone of the MD&A sections of 
Japanese listed companies’ annual securities reports from 2020 to 2023 between groups of companies reporting 
operating losses and those reporting operating profits. To proceed with this study, the sample sizes of the operating 
profit and loss companies must be aligned. Therefore, propensity score matching was used to adjust for bias and enable 
a fair comparison. The propensity score, estimated using logistic regression, refers to the probability that the treatment 
variable is an operating loss company. We set financial performance as the objective variable, and size, book-to-
market assets, average sales growth in the last three years, capital expenditures to total assets, ROA volatility, year 
dummy, and industry dummy as covariates in the logistic regression model. Subsequently, based on the estimated 
propensity score, companies with propensity scores similar to those of the control group (operating profit companies) 
are matched with the treatment group (operating loss companies) to form pairs. The difference between the means of 
the treatment and control groups after matching (N = 536) was tested for statistical significance using a t-test. The t-
test results present no statistically significant difference between the tone of positivity in the MD&A section of 
operating loss and profit companies (p = 0.53). This suggests that managers of firms with operating losses may 
manipulate their impressions to artificially improve their performance.

Abstract 
To avoid penalties for failing to meet budget targets, managers sometimes attempt to increase the percentage of budget 
targets met by creating budgetary slack. Budgetary slack is defined as the “intentional underestimation of revenues 
and productive capabilities and/or overestimation of costs and resources required to complete a budgeted task” (Dunk 
& Nouri, 1998, p. 73). However, companies want to avoid excessive budgetary slack as much as possible because this 
leads to a waste of organizational resources. Hence, how can the budgetary slack created by managers be reduced? In 
this study, we investigated two factors that reduce budgetary slack by focusing on the relationship between managers 
and their subordinates: 1) whether the manager shares budgetary-slack benefits with subordinates, and 2) the gender 
of the manager and subordinates. We conducted a 2 × 2 × 2 online experiment under the following three conditions: 
shared budgetary-slack profits (profit sharing), the gender of the department manager and subordinates (gender 
diversity), and the gender ratio in the workplace (workplace gender ratio). Participants were asked to indicate the 
budget for the next fiscal year based on the scenarios (N = 260). The ANOVA results indicated a significant interaction 
between profit sharing and workplace gender ratio (p < .05). Furthermore, male managers in male-dominated 
workplaces create more budgetary slack when they share profits with female subordinates (p < .1). Considering these 
conditions, female employees, being a minority, find it difficult to inform. Therefore, managers’ perceptions of a low 
risk of exposure lead to excessive budget-slack creation.

Abstract 
The procurement of goods and services is a fundamental component of a company's supply chain and is related to the 
quality of the final product, business continuity, productivity and costs. Within this decision-making process, it is 
important to have an information system based on previous risk assessments for the selection of the best supplier. This 
research proposes to integrate risk assessment together with the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to calculate 
the impact of each of the selection criteria in the process of choosing suppliers. The proposed methodology allowed 
the design of an information system for decision making using the Analytical Hierarchical Process with the evaluation 
of a Risk Matrix to choose a supplier. Through the opinion of experts in the areas of purchasing and operations, the 
most important criteria for selecting a supplier were found, considering the associated risk for an organization. The 
designed software allows the user to enter the relevant information of each supplier and the system generates a ranking 
of the best suppliers. It is concluded that risk management and AHP allows to involve preventive analyses that can be 
considered to anticipate possible outcomes and stipulate a contingency plan in case a risk that negatively impacts an 
organization materializes.

Abstract 
Inventory management is a key component in any organization; however, tackling it using traditional practices comes 
with numerous issues like inaccurate demand forecast, a relatively closed system, and lots of room for mistake. 
However, trend problems provide a radical solution using artificial intelligence (AI). This paper seeks to discover how 
inventory management has embraced the use of AI and what it wants to do for the traditional systems. This article 
explains technologies such as Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, NLP, and vision computers are adopted for 
application in demand sensing, inventory management, warehousing, and real-time visibility of the entire inventory 
chain is also explained. There are several steps that are followed when AI is being deployed in the inventory 
management unit, something that include data acquisition and pre-processing, model building and selection, 
integration, and post implementation mastery. The advancement in AI technology benefits the business through 
optimization of increased accuracy, decreased expenses, effectiveness of the processes involved, and better customer 
satisfaction. Thus, the paper aims to capture a broad view of AI application in the typology of inventory management 
and its promising future in the field.

1. Introduction
Inventory management is one of the core business processes, which entails the oversight of items from the 
manufacturers to the centers of distribution and from the distribution centers to the areas of consumption. This process 
involves purchasing, stocking and issuing materials used in production, that is, the various inputs that include the raw 
materials, sub-assemblies, components and products in the company. Inventory is essential in different business fields, 
and it includes retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and hospitality industries because its management influences an 
organization’s operational productivity, clients’ satisfaction, and business revenues (Cheng, 2024). Managing 
inventory has become one of the most challenging tasks for many firms in today’s competitive business environment.

6. Conclusion 
Relative to the focus of this work, this paper has reviewed the revolutionary role of artificial intelligence in managing 
inventory. Now we have reviewed how some of the optimal technologies are changing key sectors such as demand 
planning, inventory management, warehouse management and real time visibility of the supply chain. Almost all the 
drawbacks of classical approaches to inventory management, such as inaccuracy in forecast, lack of visibility, and 
reliance on manual work, are solved by the use of AI technologies. These modern solutions contribute to higher results 
and organizational effectiveness, accompanied by increased accuracy and lower costs, as noted with regards to the 
overall improvement of organizational performance and customer satisfaction. The findings from our implementation 
results in this analysis are consistent with the structure across the different industrial sectors, thus showing the potential 
gains of the AI application in inventory management, where there is greater accuracy on the forecast in addition to 
inventory cost reduction, a boost in the storage section, and overall supply chain robustness. Using the AI system to 
manage inventories is not easy, but the return on investment for these businesses is relatively worth the effort. In fact, 
as mentioned in the previous sections, the implementation of such interventions is conditioned by proper planning, 
effective data management, and subsequent continuous evaluation of the process and its improvement. In modern 
business, therefore, the integration of AI in inventory management is not an option but a necessity in today’s dynamic 
digital world. Any business that is able to incorporate these technologies will stand to benefit from the increasing 
flexibility in the market environment, thereby fulfilling customer needs and widening the competitive gap. In this way, 
AI increases its significance as technologies progress, and more and more inventory management and supply chains 
will be influenced by AI.

Abstract 
Productivity is a mindset focused on progress and continuous improvement, encompassing efficiency and 
effectiveness in production processes. In the piston industry, effective machinery and maintenance are crucial to meet 
market demands and maintain product quality. This study evaluates the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of 
machining line 2 at PT XYZ, a piston manufacturer, identifying factors affecting effectiveness and recommending 
improvements. The research calculates OEE, including availability, performance, and quality rates, and analyzes the 
Six Big Losses to pinpoint major inefficiencies. Data from January to December 2023 were used, applying Pareto and 
Fishbone diagrams to identify the root causes of losses. The average OEE for line 2 was 72.43%, below the Japan 
Institute of Plant Maintenance (JIPM) standard of 85%. Reduced speed losses (11.73%) were identified as the primary 
inefficiency. Root causes included issues related to manpower, machinery, methods, materials, and the environment. 
To enhance effectiveness, the study recommends implementing predictive maintenance within a Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM) framework. This approach focuses on proactive monitoring and timely interventions to minimize 
downtime and improve production efficiency. By adopting these measures, PT XYZ can achieve better machine 
utilization, reduce production losses, and ultimately increase productivity to meet industry standards.

1. Introduction
Purwanto and Jaqin (2021) productivity is an attitude of mind, a mentality of progress and continuous improvement 
of what is. It is a certainty of being able to do better today than yesterday and continuously making constant adaptations 
of economic and social life to changing conditions. It is an ongoing effort to apply new techniques and methods as

Based on the calculation of the six big losses, the most dominant losses are caused by reduced speed losses. Therefore, 
this fishbone diagram analyzes the causes of reduced speed losses based on man, machine, method, material, and 
environment. 
 
5.5 Proposed Improvements  
Based on the fishbone diagram (Figure 4), machine and human factors have a dominant influence on production 
productivity. Therefore, company management needs to take strategic steps to increase productivity, including 
improving machine efficiency. The company is advised to implement autonomous maintenance in the form of 
predictive maintenance, replacing reliance on preventive maintenance which is less efficient in detecting sudden 
problems. The following is an implementation of predictive maintenance (Figure 5). 
 
 
Figure 5. Implementation of Predictive Maintenance 
 
The steps to implement predictive maintenance include training and educating employees to improve autonomous 
maintenance skills, improving standard operating procedures (SOPs) for routine maintenance, implementing a 
condition monitoring system with sensors to detect potential problems, repairing and optimizing machines to reduce 
downtime, and developing a reporting system to improve response to maintenance issues.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the calculation, the Overall Effectiveness Equipment (OEE) value of the line 2 machine in the machining 
process of PT XYZ for the period January-December 2023 is 72.43%, below the JIPM standard of 85%, so 
improvement is needed. Six Big Losses analysis shows the main cause of low effectiveness is speed losses of 11.73%, 
which is caused by human, machine, material, method, and environmental factors. To address reduced speed losses, 
the company will implement autonomous maintenance in the form of predictive maintenance, enabling proactive 
monitoring, analysis and response to machine conditions. This will enable early detection of problems, optimization 
of maintenance schedules, reduced downtime, and improved production efficiency.

Abstract 
This research utilized speed losses to increase overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) at a die-casting company, PT 
XYZ. Decreased production means that demand cannot be satisfied. This happens because the production machine 
cannot produce according to the given demand, one of the factors is speed losses production. To overcome this, the 
define-measure-analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) and total productive maintenance (TPM) used to increase OEE 
and reduce speed losses. This research aims to improve machine performance, production efficiency, and operations. 
This research uses the DMAIC method to identify critical problems and resolve problems that affect the efficiency of 
production machines on the D05E line. TPM used to solving problems found and 5W1H analysis used to analyze 
problems and develop solutions regularly in various fields. The causes of speed loss consist of two parts: 1. Idling and 
minor stoppage (41%), 2. Reduced speed losses (8%). The causes of the most significant loss of speed include human 
factors, machines, materials, and methods. Speed losses as the main issue significantly impact machine productivity, 
leading to the recommendation of predictive maintenance strategies to replace the current preventive maintenance 
approach. Implementing autonomous maintenance by investing in machine inspection tools will help enhance the 
company's productivity.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry is highly competitive, with a company's success largely dependent on the productivity of 
its production facilities and product costs. To remain competitive, it's crucial for companies to establish appropriate 
metrics to assess the performance of their manufacturing systems. (Cheah et al, 2020).This industry continues to 
expand alongside technological advances and increasing demand for high-quality products. One technology widely 
used in the production process is CNC machines, which are known for their ability to produce products with high 
precision and better efficiency. However, despite the application of advanced technology, the manufacturing industry 
still needs to work on keeping these machines operating optimally without experiencing significant time or speed 
losses. 
PT XYZ, a die-casting manufacturing company located in Cikarang, West Java, Indonesia, produces various 
automotive components such as transmission cases, oil pans, steering racks, and cylinder head covers. With increasing 
market demand, PT XYZ must ensure the production process runs smoothly and maintains product quality. The CNC

6. Conclusion  
The causes of speed losses consist of two parts: idling and minor stoppage losses and reduced speed losses. The value 
of idling and minor stoppage losses is 41% and the value of reduced speed losses is 8%. The application of DMAIC 
(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) has proven effective in increasing process efficiency and product 
quality. This systematic approach helps teams identify root causes, evaluate solutions, and implement continuous 
improvements. DMAIC is a valuable tool for improving process and product performance. This research aims to 
increase OEE by reducing speed losses. Making SOPs and check sheets helps in reducing minor machine damage, 
which might cause decreased productivity.

Abstract 
The complexity of production systems has been growing exponentially over the last decade. Social, economic, and 
political trends are pushing manufacturing companies to shorten product development periods, while having higher 
flexibility as well as resource efficiency at the same time. In addition, the adoption of digital technologies has spread 
to industrial applications, generating new growth opportunities. Industry 4.0 represents the paradigm shift which 
exploits advanced digitalisation to create smart factories.  A common issue faced by manufacturing companies relates 
to identifying the main value streams in the production. Such issue is particularly relevant for high variety-low volume 
companies, for which value streams may be composed of hundreds of products and parts. By defining the main value 
streams, it is possible to gain a better understanding of production processes and highlight the key sources of 
complexity that limit efficiency. More importantly, the identification of value streams is one of the key Lean 
Production principles and it represents an enabling step for future improvements. To define value streams, having a 
clear understanding of production flows is key. The wider availability of data generated from the factory floor unlocks 
new opportunities for more informed, tailored decision-making in this context. Technologies such as sensors and 
RFID allow to collect information in real-time and provide an accurate representation of production processes.  To 
analyse the complexity of production flows, Burbidge first introduced the principles for Production Flow Analysis in 
1970s. The methodology proposed in this research builds on these fundamental principles and enhances them with 
Industry 4.0 capabilities, in particular process mining. The use of production data automatically collected from the 
factory floor allows to analyse part routings, which are the basic data representing interrelations between operations 
in Production Flow Analysis. The proposed research aims to provide a quantitative approach to automatically structure 
large amounts of production data based on production data with a specific focus on routings. By defining and analysing 
product routing homogeneity, it is possible to define clusters of products and hierarchically structure the production 
into value streams. This can be achieved by combining process mining and machine learning capabilities with the 
Production Flow Analysis principles. Ultimately, intelligent product routing-based metrics can be translated into 
automatic features that inform decisions related to the management of production systems.

Abstract 
In recent years, Northern Taiwan has experienced a significant increase in both the production of medical waste and 
the number of medical facilities. This study aims to optimize the waste collection routes for these facilities by 
formulating the problem as an Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP), leveraging the benefits of electric vehicles 
for an environmentally sustainable solution. Due to the absence of EVRP benchmarks for waste collection in Taiwan, 
this research utilizes data from Far East Memorial Hospital (FEMH) in Banqiao, New Taipei, to simulate waste 
generation across various medical facilities in the region. The proposed EVRP benchmark will be addressed using the 
Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) and compared with current waste collection practices. Additionally, the dissertation 
seeks to enhance the current waste collection schedule at FEMH. By installing IoT devices in waste bins, the amount 
of diaper waste from 30 ICU rooms will be monitored. This real-time data will be used to create a benchmark by 
formulating the collection process as a Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) and solving it using HSA. Through 
these efforts, the study aims to demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and sustainability in medical waste 
collection in Northern Taiwan.

Abstract 
The flexographic printing sector plays a crucial role in the global, Latin American, and Peruvian economies by 
efficiently producing packaging, labels, and other printed materials. Previous studies have highlighted the importance 
of Lean Manufacturing practices, such as SMED and 5S, in improving operational efficiency within SMEs. However, 
the application of these methodologies specifically in the flexographic sector has been underexplored, creating a gap 
in the literature. Flexographic SMEs face significant challenges, including high variability in machine setup times, 
operational errors, and lack of organization in workstations. These issues lead to inefficiencies, prolonged downtimes, 
and reduced productivity, directly impacting their competitiveness in a demanding market. Addressing these 
challenges is essential to enhance the sustainability and growth of these enterprises. This research proposed a Lean 
Manufacturing-based production model tailored for flexographic SMEs, integrating SMED, 5S, and standardized

Abstract 
The plastic manufacturing sector, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is a critical component of the 
global economy, significantly contributing to economic growth, innovation, and employment. Despite their 
importance, these enterprises face numerous challenges that hinder their production processes, including recurrent 
machine breakdowns, operational inefficiencies, and lack of effective visual management systems. Addressing these 
issues is vital for the survival and growth of SMEs in this sector, especially in the context of the disruptions caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. To tackle these challenges, this study proposed a comprehensive model integrating Lean 
Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) methodologies, specifically tailored for SMEs in the plastic 
sector. The model includes the implementation of 5S for workplace organization, autonomous maintenance to 
empower operators with routine maintenance tasks, planned maintenance for systematic equipment upkeep, and visual 
management to enhance workplace communication and efficiency. These components were designed to streamline 
production processes, reduce waste, and improve overall operational efficiency. The implementation of this model 
yielded significant improvements in key performance indicators. The reprocessing rate per burn mark decreased from 
2.20% to 1.36%, operational efficiency increased from 57.69% to 85.10%, mean time to repair (MTTR) was reduced 
from 5.314 hours to 2.69 hours, and downtime decreased from 9.45 minutes to 5.15 minutes. These results demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the proposed model in enhancing production efficiency and reliability, ultimately leading to cost 
savings and increased competitiveness for SMEs. The academic and socio-economic impact of this research is 
substantial. Academically, it bridges a gap in the literature by providing a practical framework for the integration of 
Lean and TPM methodologies in SMEs. Socio-economically, the model contributes to the sustainability and growth 
of SMEs, which are essential for economic development and job creation. The successful implementation of the model 
in the case study serves as a replicable benchmark for other enterprises in the sector. In conclusion, this study 
underscores the importance of adopting comprehensive, data-driven approaches to address operational challenges in 
SMEs. It calls for further research to explore the integration of advanced technologies, such as digitalization and 
artificial intelligence, with Lean and TPM methodologies to drive continuous improvement and innovation in the 
manufacturing sector. Future studies should also focus on validating the model across different industries and 
operational contexts to enhance its applicability and impact.

quantitative results obtained after implementing the model show a 47.51% improvement in operational efficiency, a 
38.36% reduction in the reprocessing rate due to burn marks, a 49.38% decrease in mean time to repair (MTTR), and 
a 45.50% reduction in downtime. These data highlight the model's effectiveness in improving productivity and 
equipment reliability. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to strengthening the operational capacity and competitiveness 
of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the plastics sector in Peru. By providing a practical and adaptable 
framework based on proven tools for continuous improvement and maintenance, the research offers SMEs a clear 
strategy to overcome recurring challenges that affect their efficiency and sustainability. In a context where SMEs 
represent a significant portion of employment in the private sector and are vital for innovation and economic growth, 
adopting practices such as those proposed in this study can result in substantial benefits at the sectoral and national 
levels, promoting a more robust and dynamic manufacturing industry. 
 
Contributions to the field of study include the empirical validation of an integrated Lean Manufacturing and TPM 
model specifically for SMEs in the plastics sector, a segment that faces unique challenges due to its scale and limited 
resources. This study expands the existing literature by demonstrating that the combination of these philosophies can 
be successfully adapted to SMEs, achieving significant improvements in operational efficiency and reducing defects 
and downtime. Additionally, the methodological approach employed can serve as a basis for future research and 
applications in other industrial sectors, contributing to the development of more effective and sustainable management 
practices. 
 
Finally, some observations and suggestions for further studies are offered. Additional research exploring the 
implementation of the model in different industrial and geographical contexts is recommended to validate its 
applicability and effectiveness under various conditions. It would also be valuable to investigate the integration of 
emerging technologies, such as Industry 4.0, into the proposed model to further enhance the efficiency and 
responsiveness of SMEs. Moreover, future studies could focus on measuring the long-term impact of implementing 
these practices on the sustainability and economic growth of companies, providing a broader perspective on the 
associated benefits and challenges.

in high rates of non-conforming products and prolonged format change times, affecting the competitiveness and 
sustainability of these companies. To solve these problems, a production model based on Lean Manufacturing tools 
was proposed, specifically SMED, 5S, and Standardized Work. These tools were selected for their proven 
effectiveness in improving operational efficiency and reducing waste. The implementation of the model involved an 
initial diagnosis, followed by the systematic application of each tool, focusing on the transformation of internal to 
external tasks, workspace organization, and process standardization. The key results of the study included a 60% 
reduction in format change time, an increase in operational efficiency from 47.66% to 91.15%, and an improvement 
in product quality reflected in the decrease of defective products. These findings validate the effectiveness of the 
proposed model, demonstrating significant improvements in productivity and quality in paper bag manufacturing. The 
academic and socioeconomic impact of this research is notable, as it provides a practical and structured framework 
for addressing production inefficiencies in manufacturing SMEs. Waste reduction contributes to environmental 
sustainability, while improvements in productivity and quality strengthen the competitiveness of companies in the 
global market. This study provides new evidence to the existing body of knowledge on the application of Lean 
Manufacturing in specific sectors. In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of adopting Lean 
Manufacturing methodologies to transform production processes and achieve continuous improvement in the 
manufacturing industry. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to explore and adapt these methodologies in 
various industrial contexts, promoting innovation and sustainable growth.

Abstract 
The textile sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), plays a pivotal role in the economy by 
generating employment and fostering innovation. However, these enterprises face significant challenges, including 
production inefficiencies and quality control issues. Previous research has explored the application of Lean 
Manufacturing methodologies to address these challenges, yet there remains a gap in the literature regarding 
comprehensive models tailored specifically for textile SMEs. This study aimed to fill this gap by proposing a Lean 
Synergy Production Model integrating Change Management, 5S, Methods-Time Measurement (MTM), and Line 
Balancing. The textile sector faces urgent challenges such as high defect rates, excessive cycle times, and low 
productivity. These issues stem from inadequate production methods and poor workplace organization, resulting in 
increased costs and reduced competitiveness. The proposed model addresses these challenges by streamlining 
processes and enhancing operational efficiency. The model implementation involved training employees, reorganizing 
the workspace, optimizing task allocation, and balancing production lines. Key results from the six-month pilot 
implementation included a 65.67% reduction in delivery delays, a 23.08% decrease in defective products, and a 
27.27% reduction in reprocessing rates. Productivity increased by 84.62%, and cycle time was reduced by 25%. These 
outcomes demonstrate the model's effectiveness in improving production efficiency and quality in textile SMEs. The 
study's impact extends beyond operational improvements, contributing to academic literature by providing a validated 
model for Lean implementation in SMEs. Socioeconomically, the enhanced efficiency and quality can lead to 
increased competitiveness and market share for textile SMEs, fostering sustainable economic growth.  Future research 
should explore the model's adaptability to other sectors and its long-term sustainability. This study calls on researchers 
and industry practitioners to further investigate and refine Lean methodologies to support the continuous improvement 
of SMEs globally.

5. Results 
Table 1 shows the results of the validation of the proposed model to improve processes in a small textile company. 
The validation was carried out through a six-month pilot in which the model was implemented to evaluate its 
effectiveness. Key indicators compared before and after model implementation include the rate of delay in delivery of 
goods, the rate of defective products, the rate of reprocessing, productivity and cycle time. At present, the rate of delay 
in the delivery of goods was 67 per cent, while the goal was to reduce it to 15 per cent. The results showed a decrease 
to 23%, achieving a negative variation of 65.67%, although the target of 15% was not reached. The rate of defective 
products was reduced from 26% to 20%, meeting the established target and achieving a decrease of 23.08%. The 
reprocessing rate decreased from 22 to 16 per cent, with a negative variation of 27.27 per cent, also meeting the 
proposed target. Productivity increased from 13 units per day to 24 units per day, exceeding the target of 20 units and 
achieving an increase of 84.62%. The cycle time was reduced from 26.8 minutes to 20.1 minutes, exceeding the target 
of 23 minutes and achieving a negative variation of 25%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in 
improving the efficiency and quality of production processes in the company, highlighting significant reductions in 
delivery delay rates, defective products and reprocessing, as well as a considerable increase in productivity and a 
reduction in cycle time.

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of the study show significant improvements in the efficiency and quality of production processes 
in a small textile company after implementing the proposed model. The rate of delay in the delivery of goods was 
reduced by 65.67%, from 67% to 23%. The rate of defective products decreased by 23.08%, from 26% to 20%. The 
reprocessing rate also experienced a reduction of 27.27%, dropping from 22% to 16%. Productivity notably increased 
by 84.62%, from 13 to 24 units per day. Additionally, the cycle time was reduced by 25%, from 26.8 minutes to 20.1 
minutes. These results indicate that the model not only improved operational efficiency but also increased the final 
product quality and production capacity. 
 
The research conducted is of great importance because it comprehensively addresses the critical challenges faced by 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the textile sector, especially regarding efficiency and quality in 
production. The implementation of Lean Manufacturing techniques, such as the 5S methodology, Methods-Time 
Measurement (MTM), and line balancing, proved effective in solving common problems in SMEs, such as high rates 
of defective products, prolonged cycle times, and low productivity. Adopting these practices not only improves 
internal processes but also contributes to the economic and competitive sustainability of companies in an increasingly 
demanding market. 
 
The contributions of this study to the field of industrial engineering are significant. The proposed synergistic 
production model integrates various Lean Manufacturing tools, demonstrating that their joint application can generate 
more robust and sustainable results than the isolated implementation of each tool. This holistic approach provides a 
practical and applicable framework for SMEs, particularly in the textile industry context, allowing for continuous 
improvement in their production processes. Additionally, the study offers empirical validation of Lean Manufacturing 
techniques, providing concrete evidence of their benefits in terms of operational efficiency and product quality. 
 
Finally, final observations and suggestions for future studies are offered. It is recommended to explore the adaptability 
of the proposed model to other industrial sectors to evaluate its effectiveness in different production contexts. Future 
research could also focus on the long-term impact of implementing these tools on the economic and environmental 
sustainability of companies. The inclusion of new technologies, such as Industry 4.0, could also be a promising area 
to investigate how digitalization and automation can complement and enhance Lean Manufacturing practices. This

Addressing Hospital Surge Capacity Issues amidst a Dual 
Crisis in a Developing Country: Human Resource 
Management Perspectives

Abstract 
Managing human resources in hospitals is a complex process, which becomes more critical in times of emergency or 
crisis. Hospital surge capacity (SC) deals with the ability to manage sudden or dramatic boosts in patient numbers. 
Preparedness for addressing SC issues is vital for effective healthcare delivery. Availability of skilled, adequate and 
motivated healthcare workforce is an integral part of SC. Researchers show that limited attention has been given to 
explicitly addressing human resource management (HRM) issues in SC preparedness plans. Research around HRM 
issues associated with SC of hospitals in developing countries is also notably low. The COVID-19 pandemic brought 
about unprecedented challenges to hospitals across the globe. Hospitals were arguably unprepared for a crisis of this 
magnitude. Sri Lankan hospitals confront a dual crisis as the country’s pandemic impact was compounded by an 
economic crisis. Based on the HRM process perspective and the practice perspective of crisis management, this study 
explored the HRM challenges and response strategies associated with SC issues in four Sri Lankan hospitals, across 
the two crises. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 hospital managers. Thematic analysis was 
performed on the transcribed data, assisted with NVivo. This study add to HRM, crisis management and hospital 
preparedness literature, insights from a developing country context. Findings can be useful to policy makers and HRM 
practitioners in local hospitals for designing sustainable SC solutions to prevail challenges of future crises.

User-Centered Design Approach for Designing an Assistive 
Product for the Elderly Population

Abstract 
The elderly often face challenges such as getting in and out of bed, turning over, sitting up, and generally getting 
comfortable. Despite various product design measures, a large population of elderly individuals remains reluctant to 
use assistive tools and apparatuses. In India, while most elderly live alone or with their spouse, very few live with 
their adult children due to the growing trend of nuclear families in cities and metros. A common issue among the 
elderly, exacerbated by muscle and joint-related ailments, is the difficulty of getting out of bed. They struggle to 
support themselves with their body strength during this process. Although several studies have focused on cognitive 
abilities and independent tools for support, few have addressed the need for a user-centered design approach in creating 
products for the elderly. Therefore, there is a need for products designed with ethnographic studies to provide valuable 
insights for solutions tailored to specific activities. This paper includes a contextual study documenting the motion of 
elderly individuals while getting out of bed. A motion study was conducted with a user group of elderly individuals 
aged 65 to 75 years. Posture analysis was used to ideate solutions, followed by mock-ups. The paper presents a 
preliminary step in designing aids for the elderly.

1. Introduction
According to the United Nations’ Population Division, the elderly population is projected to double between 2023 
and 2050, increasing from 170 million in 2023 to 332 million in 2050 (Figure 1). The elderly live either alone, with 
a spouse, with children and grandchildren, in old age homes, or in hospitals while recuperating from an illness.

playing exercise for postural analysis, specifically during the initial body lift, is also suggested. Anthropometric data 
will be utilized in developing a prototype that provides adequate support for standing upright. 
 
5.  Conclusion 
Guidelines are often divided into two primary categories: academic and industrial. The active involvement of the 
elderly was essential during the research and ideation stages. This product is designed to reduce the physical strain on 
elderly individuals when getting up and out of bed. With the elderly population in the US expected to grow from 17% 
in 2022 to 23% by 2050, reaching 82 million—primarily due to the baby boom between 1946 and 1964 and increased 
life expectancy—there is an urgent need to develop assistive products to meet the rising demand for aids and devices. 
Following this study, the next step is to advance to the design and development phase, which includes creating 
prototypes after further mockup development. Mockups help understand the form and allow for quickly developing 
various feature configurations.

Abstract 
In the competitive landscape of Industry 4.0, maintaining operational efficiency and minimising downtime is crucial 
for achieving production targets and reducing costs. Typical maintenance strategies include corrective maintenance 
(CM), preventative maintenance (PM) and predicted maintenance (PdM). While advanced technologies like the 
Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) dominate current maintenance optimisation strategies for PdM, 
many companies require years to complete digital transformation fully. This research addresses the present needs of 
companies in the early stages of Industry 4.0 by enhancing maintenance strategies to improve productivity and cost-
effectiveness. This project aims to develop an optimised PM schedule using historical data from Mars Petcare’s 
Bathurst factory. By employing advanced analytics and regression modelling techniques, we seek to identify the 
optimal PM intervals that balance maintenance costs with machine downtime, ensuring maximum factory availability 
and operational efficiency. Initial analyses have identified the pack line as the most critical section concerning costs, 
frequency, and duration. In the regression modelling, the cost of PM and CM are identified to have a close relationship 
with PM intervals, PM hours and the Machine. The equations are post-processed into plotting, delineating the 
relationship between PM frequency and total maintenance costs, and pinpointing the optimal intervals. By optimising 
the maintenance schedule, this project aims to reduce costs and downtime while laying the foundation for future 
predictive maintenance initiatives. The findings provide Mars PetCare and similar industries at the early level with a 
strategic tool for cost-effective maintenance management, contributing to enhanced operational efficiency and

Future research should explore ways to make advanced maintenance technologies more accessible, especially for 
smaller organizations, by focusing on cost-effective solutions (Zonta et al., 2020). Additionally, attention should be 
given to balancing PM frequency with potential increases in indirect labour costs and the impact on production output. 
If the additional costs outweigh the benefits, adjustments to the PM schedule may not be justified. Successful 
implementation of the optimal maintenance interval also requires careful planning to ensure maintenance activities do 
not conflict with peak production periods. Effective inventory and supply chain management are critical to securing 
the necessary spare parts without delays or excessive costs. Furthermore, operational flexibility should be maintained, 
allowing adjustments to maintenance schedules to be made without disrupting production processes. This proposed 
PM optimization framework offers valuable insights for cost-effective maintenance scheduling and contributes to the 
broader understanding of maintenance strategies for companies at the entry-level of Industry 4.0. By utilizing historical 
data, this study lays the groundwork for future research and practical applications in the field of maintenance 
optimization, demonstrating the potential for enhanced operational efficiency through data-driven approaches.

Abstract 
With rapid developments in the field of AI and data centers, there is a soaring demand for backup power and due to 
this, genset manufacturers are compelled to increase their throughput and reduce lead times. This study focuses on 
incorporating process optimization and lean tools for lowering the overall takt time by reducing the cycle time of the 
generator assembly process at a genset manufacturing company. The eventual goal is to increase the throughput from 
6 generators per day to 7 per day. The paper follows a step-by-step methodology starting from the problem statement 
and uses statistical analysis to monitor the data. The value chain is identified using the current state value stream map 
and the standard operating procedures (SOPs). The bottlenecks are singled out and a process improvement action plan 
is created. The process is monitored again after the changes are made in the assembly process and the results are 
recorded. A total reduction in process time of 30 minutes is achieved from Cells 2 and 3.

1. Introduction
Due to the growing dependence on electricity in today's society and the rise in power outages caused by natural 
disasters, aging infrastructure, and cyber-attacks, backup power is increasingly important. A backup power setup 
ensures that vital operations continue in various industries. Providing backup power to healthcare facilities, for 
instance, ensures the safety and continuity of life support equipment, operation rooms, and other critical medical 
devices. Data centers and telecommunication networks can also benefit from backup power since it prevents data loss 
and service disruptions. Power failures can have a range of negative outcomes, ranging from inconvenience to life-
threatening situations. Backup power systems help in eliminating these consequences by providing power supply to 
appliances and systems. It means keeping refrigerators running and maintaining heating and cooling systems to ensure 
comfort and safety. It also means keeping communication channels open so that emergency services and individuals 
can reach each other. As environmental calamities and cyber risks grow, backup power solutions boost preparedness 
and resilience. During crisis situations, they provide both individuals and organizations with a power source for 
sustaining operations and responding effectively to situations. Further, they contribute to energy security by reducing 
reliance on the power grid and expanding the range of energy sources available. 
In the manufacturing sector, production systems are facing the ongoing challenge of devising a process to boost output. 
To address this crisis, companies need a large chunk of the workforce and resources to uphold growth and deliver top-
notch products to their clients. By setting up a series of value-adding activities with the application of lean 
methodologies, an efficient process can be crafted. Several tools including motion analysis, value stream analysis, 5S 
methodology, design optimization, and bottleneck analysis can be utilized (Rother & Shook, 2003). Process and 
quality improvement tools especially utilizing lean and Six Sigma concepts are widely used in both manufacturing

5.2 Discussion 
The reduction in process cycle times in Cells 2 and 3 was achieved primarily through the identification and elimination 
of bottlenecks in the assembly process. The use of value stream maps and statistical tools like the Yamazumi chart 
helped us identify the non-value-added activities and aid in optimizing the assembly times. Time study analysis 
pinpointed variations in the assembly times by each assembler which were crucial in pinpointing areas of 
improvement. Overall, a 30-minute cycle time reduction was achieved in Cell 2 and 3 effectively.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The research focused on optimizing cycle times across the Line 1 High Power Range Assembly line across six 
manufacturing cells. After performing detailed time studies and implementation of lean principles, considerable 
improvements were achieved in two cells, where the overall cycle time was reduced by 30 minutes in Cell 2 and Cell 
3 effectively, showcasing efficiency gains of 2.75% and 5.68% respectively. The significant gains were achieved by 
eliminating non-value-added activities and optimizing work processes. The focus was to reduce setup times and 
streamline the overall material handling process. Further scope of research would help in addressing constraints and 
opportunities of the other workstations. Overall, process optimization along with the use of lean manufacturing tools 
demonstrated how productivity can be increased and processes can be streamlined in various manufacturing settings.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on the application of DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) process of Six 
Sigma methodology for increasing the production numbers in an electronics manufacturing industry. The overall 
production numbers are improved by identifying the root causes and improving the process efficiency. Detailed 
analysis of the process cycle time for all stations is conducted and key areas for improvement are identified. Proper 
implementation of the suggested changes is conducted, and the results are verified. Further recommendations are 
provided for addressing the key improvement areas for reducing the cycle time of the bottleneck process. The findings 
highlight the benefits of implementing six sigma processes in an electronic manufacturing industry and provide a 
roadmap for other organizations seeking similar improvements by using data driven decision-making.

1. Introduction
Considering current worldwide trends and improvements, it is evident that the electronic manufacturing business has 
significant importance in today's world. With the world transitioning into the digital era, there is a growing need for 
electronic components and chips. Electronic manufacturing includes the processes of designing, fabricating, testing, 
assembling, and distributing goods, which are like conventional manufacturing methods. Electronic components have 
a wide variety of applications, including cell phones, military equipment, automotive systems, medical devices, 
financial services, and several other areas. To meet the growing demand, organizations are using several strategies to 
enhance their production and product quality while minimizing expenses. Continuous Improvement tools and methods 
like Lean, Six Sigma etc are highly used by industry to effectively address this difficulty.  
These tools promote the use of data driven decision-making practices by using various processes like time study, 
statistical process control, control charts, pareto charts, etc. While six sigma is a methodology and DMAIC approach 
is used in this to address the challenges in most of the industries. Data driven tools and methods are used while 
following this approach. After the collection of the data, they are analyzed with the help of software like Minitab 
where the required numerical tests can be conducted including hypothesis testing, ANOVA, Control Charts, graphical 
representation etc.  
Therefore, for our experimentation we will be following the DMAIC approach of six sigma which will include all the 
phases of the approach. Data collection will be done with the help of a stopwatch for time studies while the production 
numbers will be collected from the ERP system of the company. The challenge will be to increase the production 
number of the gas meter production line.

5. Results and Discussion  
The outcomes for each phase of the DMAIC process are mentioned below.  
1. Define: The outline of the project was defined by identifying our goal to increase the production numbers 
from 402 units per shift to 770 units per shift. It was required to conduct the time study on every station of 
the line while also documenting the performance of the operators. 
 
2. Measure: Time study on each line was conducted and the data was measured as per the requirements. The 
average cycle time for each station was measured. For the board test it was 28.8 seconds, Solder station was 
at 47.18 seconds, assembly station it was 38 seconds, heat stake station it was 46.8 seconds, potter station 
was at 40 seconds and final test and pack station was at 16.5 seconds.  
 
3. Analyze: In the Analyze phase, the solder station was identified as the bottleneck station with an average 
cycle time of 47.18 seconds. Upon further consideration, it was witnessed that the average cycle time for 
Operator F was 157.21 seconds. The overall production efficiency was found to be 53%.  
4. Improve: Operator F was replaced with Operator X, and it was found out that Operator X is 56 seconds 
quicker than Operator F. The overall cycle time of solder station reduced to 42.5 seconds and the production 
numbers increased to 585 units per shift.  
 
5. Control: Use of X-bar S chart has been made mandatory for every station to see any outliers from the control 
limits. A communication matrix was also developed to keep the team and the management in better contact 
with each other.  
 
6. Conclusion  
DMAIC process was used to overcome the challenge of increasing production numbers. Successful results were 
observed after the successful implementation of the suggested improvisations. 
• 
To find the bottleneck station, a time study was conducted for each station on the assembly line while also 
documenting the performance of the operators. 
• 
Solder station was the bottleneck station in the current phase where most of the negative impact was due the 
inefficiency of operator “F”. 
• 
Operator “F” was replaced with operator “X” and the overall cycle time of the process was reduced to 42.5 
seconds which meant that the updated bottleneck station was heat stake station. The production efficiency 
was increased to 76 %. 
• 
To reduce the cycle time on heat stake station, one of the suggested changes was to replace the heat stake 
machine with the updated machine which will reduce the cycle time of the station to 36 seconds.  
• 
Another suggested change was to include another heat stake machine in the line which will reduce the cycle 
time of the station to 23.2 seconds and the updated bottleneck station will be the solder station with a cycle 
time of 42.5 seconds.  
 
The successful implementation of the DMAIC process has increased the production numbers by nearly 200 units per 
shift, which could be improved if the suggested improvements are implemented.

Abstract 
A critical question is what leads some companies, but not others, to be sustainable in their procurement operations. 
Some studies respond to this question using various theoretical frameworks. However, these frameworks, while 
valuable, do not fully reflect the nuances of decision-making in procurement operations. The theory of planned 
behavior (TPB) is recognized as the most influential framework for predicting behavior but its application in 
operations management is hitherto limited. We aim to illuminate the role of individual attitudes, capabilities, and 
behavioral intentions in actualizing sustainable procurement. We develop a framework by adapting TPB to the context 
of sustainable procurement. We test this framework with a sample of 465 procurement professionals based in the EU 
through partial least squares structural equation modeling. We find that sustainable purchasing behavior is 
predominantly shaped by behavioral intention, that is, willingness to pay for sustainability. This behavioral intention 
is significantly influenced by individual attitudes and capabilities in addition to awareness of consequences and 
corporate social responsibility engagement but, interestingly, not by subjective norms. The present study contributes 
to understanding individual-level antecedents of operations management practices and offers suggestions to 
practitioners engaged in fostering sustainability in supply chains.

Abstract 
Purpose – Opportunism is the key risk that can deteriorate the cooperation that prevails between two parties in a 
relationship. Therefore, it is important to curb this outcome to ensure that both the parties orchestrate their decisions 
in the best interest of each other. Accentuating this phenomenon, the context of humanitarian logistics and partner 
relationship is visualized from the lens of opportunism. Design/methodology/approach – Leveraging on the anchoring 
of transaction cost economics, a focus on governance unlocks the positions of formal control mechanisms (contracts) 
and trust to shape governance mechanisms. Distinguishing features of the humanitarian logistics scenario are duly 
theorized on the grounds of opportunism and volatility. A difficult to orchestrate survey of 150 humanitarian field 
executives is conducted. Findings – In terms of humanitarian logistics governance, to curb opportunism, formal 
governance via contracts bear a strong positive effect on trust, while formal governance alone has no significant effect 
in curbing opportunism. However, trust is very much capable of mitigating opportunism. Most interestingly, contract 
can serve as the premise to bolster trust between the parties in the challenging setting of humanitarian relief. However, 
as the volatility of the disaster increases, it can distort the positive synergies of governance levers to make opportunism 
uncontrollable. Originality/value – This research is the first attempt to study the role of volatility and opportunism in 
the humanitarian logistics based on primary data. The insights on contractual versus trust based governance have been 
well contrasted with traditional contexts of logistics and supply chain management. Findings outline that what might 
work in peacetime contexts might not hold for humanitarian logistics.

Abstract 
This research is a continuation of work presented in reference [Soni et al 2024] in which a number of specimens were 
prepared. Micromechanical effective stem properties were computed. Here, we conduct micro and macro stiffness 
analysis of hemp stem reinforced concrete specimens with a 0 and a 0/90/0 orientations and testing. Based upon 
micromechanical models of predicting effective properties of stems and laminates, we have used NDSANDS module 
and CLAP module of ASCA [Soni, 1994]. Effective properties of at least 4 specimens of hemp stem reinforced 
concrete composite specimens are measured for both a 0 and 0/90/0 of hemp stem volume elements and are calculated 
using constituent properties [Bhoopati and Suresh 2019].  A set of hemp stem reinforced concrete composite specimens, 
(Figure 1), are prepared [Soni et al 2024] and considered for conducting tests and relevant stiffness analysis.

Abstract 
Heartfulness (HFN) Meditation has proven to be very affective in nurturing balanced lifestyle in practitioners [Soni 
and Soni, 2021,2021,2024]. A continuous systematic practice provides inner peace, settled-ness and acceptance. 
Through this one starts seeing hidden guidance through even inacceptable happenings. This paper gives a set of 
experiences encountered in the process. One is related to conflict in the schedule and acceptance resulted in an efficient 
outcome. Second is effect of meditation to treat the fatigue because of radiation therapy. That is based upon HFN 
meditation with guidance provided by 10 maxims of Sahaj Marg.   In October 2023, we had a conflict of interest 
between treatment and participation in IEOM conference in Dubai. The acceptance emerged into the situation that 
resulted into accomplishing both tasks efficiently.

Abstract 
A country characterized by lower average living standards, underdeveloped industries, lower gross domestic product 
(GDP), and lower gross national income (GNI) in comparison to developed countries is generally referred to as a 
developing country. Some countries with the world's largest economy are still considered developing countries 
because their GDP per capita is lower than that of countries generally considered developed. There is still an 
ongoing debate about the definition of a developing country. This study aims to find out the developing country's 
lean manufacturing sectors, compare the developing country's GDP with the USA, and evidence for implementing 
lean manufacturing in developing countries. The study is based on literary reviews and online resources provided by 
the university library and public databases. It finds that the adoption of lean manufacturing in developing countries 
is comparatively low. The industries of developing countries face challenges in adopting most of the lean tools 
because of socio-economic culture. Besides, this study also shows how implementing lean tools in developing 
countries helps with the growth of industry and GDP by reducing cost, time, and defects, and how to use non-
utilized talents. With the help of lean manufacturing, developing countries can increase the market.

1. Introduction
Lean is a thinking that emphasizes efficiency, continuous improvement, and value for the customer. The core value 
of lean is to reduce non-value-adding activities and waste. This idea has been well received by many companies 
worldwide and has been proven to increase productivity along with the elimination of waste.  
Waste is that aspect where the customer thinks it does not add value, which they are not willing to pay for. Lean 
Manufacturing keeps an understanding nature with the customer value systematically by identifying as well as 
reducing waste through continuous improvement towards perfection. As the world is globalizing rapidly, the 
competition is thriving, customer demands are increasing, and technologies are advancing (Brito et al., 2019), 
companies are facing fierce competition in the market. To survive this competition, companies must change their 
approach to their business and adopt a new system of manufacturing technology, and here comes Lean 
Manufacturing (Psomas and Antony, 2019). With this new introduction, companies can do more with less, such as 
less time, less waste, less labor, and less cost.

Conceptualizing Stakeholder Influence on Modern Slavery 
Legislation: Towards Greater Transparency in Australian 
Supply Chains 
Talita Meira 
Hult International Business School, Australia

Abstract 
This paper conceptualizes the impact of stakeholder engagement on the effectiveness of modern slavery legislation in 
enhancing supply chain transparency within Australian organizations. By leveraging Stakeholder Theory, Institutional 
Theory, and Modern Slavery Theory, the study develops a conceptual framework to analyze how the engagement of 
stakeholders can influence supply chain transparency when organizations comply with modern slavery legislation. 
The framework integrates Schäfer’s sustainable supply chain transparency dimensions with elements of the Australian 
Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth), such as quality of reports, risk assessment coverage, ethical practices implementation, 
and supply chain visibility. This study addresses the gap in empirical research on the efficacy of modern slavery 
legislation and the role of stakeholders in promoting transparency. The findings are intended to guide organizations 
in developing strategies to comply with modern slavery laws, improve supply chain transparency, and foster ethical 
practices. The proposed model sets the stage for future quantitative research to test and refine the relationships between 
legislative compliance, stakeholder engagement, and supply chain transparency, providing actionable insights for 
policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. 
1. Introduction
The resulting pressure in the supply chain for rapid and cost-effective access to goods and services can increase the 
risk of modern slavery as hidden offences in the supply chains (Nolan & Bott, 2018). Due to the nature of long chains 
with many levels of suppliers, distributors and retailers until a customer's needs are met, maintaining the transparency 
of the whole supply chain is a genuine concern (Francisco & Swanson, 2018).  
Within this context, the United Nations (UN) has included the issue of modern slavery in the supply chain in the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Target 8.7 of the SDGs aims to achieve fair employment, decent work for 
women and men, including young people and disabled individuals, and equal pay for work of equal value by 2030 
(United Nations, 2023). To assist in reaching this goal by 2030, the United Kingdom (UK) introduced the Modern 
Slavery Act in 2015. Following a similar approach, Australia enacted its version of the Modern Slavery Act 2018 
(Cth) (Rogerson, Crane, Soundararajan, Grosvold, et al., 2020).  
The Australian law, implemented in January 2019, addresses modern slavery in global supply chains. Companies with 
consolidated yearly revenue exceeding AUD 100 million must provide Modern Slavery Statements annually. These 
reports must detail the measures adopted to recognize and mitigate the risks of modern slavery in their business 
activities and supply chains (Australia Government, 2023). 
Despite the efforts and commitments of some countries, such as Australia and the UK, to eradicate modern slavery 
from the supply chain, there remains a gap in the literature concerning the efficacy of the regulations on addressing 
the issue (Mantouvalou, 2018; Nolan & Frishling, 2019). There is limited empirical evidence on how effectively these 
mandates are enforced and their tangible impact on supply chains' transparency and ethical operation (Szablewska &

a. Evaluation of the Propositions 
• 
Proposition 1 (P1): Improved reporting quality increases supply chain transparency.  
This proposition posits that higher-quality and more comprehensive reporting directly leads to increased transparency 
in supply chains. Theoretical support for this proposition can be seen in the Institutional Theory, which suggests that 
organizations adopt practices and structures that are seen as legitimate and appropriate within their institutional 
environment. High-quality reporting practices enhance the organisation's disclosures' legitimacy, increasing 
transparency. 
• 
Proposition 2 (P2): The increase in supply chain transparency resulting from high reporting quality is 
mediated by stakeholder engagement.  
This proposition suggests that high-quality reporting is enhanced by the level of stakeholder engagement, which in 
turn improves supply chain transparency. Stakeholder Theory underpins this proposition, highlighting that active 
engagement with stakeholders, such as suppliers, customers, and NGOs, ensures that the reporting is high in quality 
but also relevant and comprehensive. This engagement builds trust and accountability, further enhancing transparency. 
• 
Proposition 3 (P3): Comprehensive risk assessment coverage increases supply chain transparency when 
the level of stakeholder engagement is higher.  
This proposition says that comprehensive risk assessment coverage benefits from greater stakeholder engagement, 
which results in increased supply chain transparency. Drawing from the Modern Slavery Theory, effective risk 
assessments are critical in identifying and mitigating risks associated with modern slavery. When stakeholders are 
actively engaged, they provide critical insights and feedback that enhance the effectiveness of risk assessments, 
therefore improving transparency. 
• 
Proposition 4 (P4): Effective implementation of ethical practices improves supply chain transparency 
when stakeholder engagement is enhanced.  
This proposition suggests that improved stakeholder engagement facilitates the effective implementation of ethical 
practices and leads to better supply chain transparency. The Institutional Theory supports this proposition by 
emphasizing that organizations adhering to ethical standards and involving stakeholders enhance their legitimacy and 
transparency. 
• 
Proposition 5 (P5): Enhanced supply chain visibility increases transparency.  
This proposition asserts that enhanced supply chain visibility leads to improved transparency. Schäfer's sustainable 
supply chain transparency framework supports this proposition by emphasizing that supply chain visibility and 
disclosure are crucial components for enhancing supply chain transparency.  
 
b. Theoretical and Practical Contributions 
The proposed model offers significant theoretical contributions by integrating multiple theories—Stakeholder Theory, 
Institutional Theory, and Modern Slavery Theory—into a cohesive framework. Practically, the model provides 
actionable insights for organizations aiming to enhance supply chain transparency through improved reporting, 
comprehensive risk assessments, ethical practices, and increased visibility, all mediated by effective stakeholder 
engagement. 
 
c. 
Limitations and Future Research 
While this study presents a robust framework for understanding the dynamics of supply chain transparency, limitations 
must be acknowledged. The reliance on the quality and consistency of modern slavery statements, which can vary 
significantly across organizations, presents a challenge. Future research should consider triangulating data from 
multiple sources, including third-party audits and independent reports such as sustainability reports, to enhance data 
accuracy and validity. 
 
Moreover, the model was developed with a broad view of multiple industries, but specific industry characteristics and 
practices can influence supply chain transparency differently. Future research should examine sector-specific 
dynamics to understand how industries respond to modern slavery legislation and stakeholder engagement.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This study provides valuable insights into how stakeholder engagement and modern slavery legislation influence 
supply chain transparency. By integrating multiple theories and frameworks, this research offers an understanding of 
the factors contributing to supply chain transparency.

This research demonstrated that high-quality reporting, comprehensive risk assessments, ethical practices, and 
increased visibility can enhance supply chain transparency. Stakeholder engagement could play a crucial mediating 
role in these relationships, emphasizing the importance of involving stakeholders in transparency efforts. 
 
This study also contributes to the existing body of knowledge by integrating Stakeholder Theory, Institutional Theory, 
and Modern Slavery Theory into a cohesive framework developed by Schäfer around Sustainable Supply Chain 
Transparency. These theoretical insights highlight the multifaceted nature of supply chain transparency and the critical 
role of stakeholder engagement in fostering transparency and accountability. 
 
Moreover, organizations can leverage these insights to improve their transparency practices. Focusing on high-quality 
reporting, thorough risk assessments, ethical practices, and increased visibility, coupled with effective stakeholder 
engagement, can significantly enhance supply chain transparency. These practices are essential for organizations 
aiming to combat modern slavery and promote ethical supply chain management. 
 
However, while this study offers a robust framework, it relies on the quality and consistency of modern slavery 
statements, which can vary. Future research should triangulate data from multiple sources to enhance validity. The 
broad view of multiple industries can influence supply chain transparency differently, so sector-specific dynamics 
should be explored further. Additionally, incorporating qualitative methods will capture diverse stakeholder 
perspectives and provide a more holistic view. 
 
In conclusion, this study underscores the critical role of stakeholder engagement and modern slavery legislation in 
enhancing supply chain transparency. The findings have significant implications for policymakers, practitioners, and 
researchers aiming to combat modern slavery and promote ethical supply chain practices. Organizations can contribute 
to a more just and accountable global supply chain by fostering transparency and ethical behaviour.

Abstract 
BPO companies often provide services like merchant onboarding applications for their clients, which can be taxing 
and hard to monitor due to the many tasks required before fully accomplishing the application. For the company, 
problems that often plague its database and system are long loading times, long data cleaning times, and a high 
transcription error rate. The process was seen to have potential issues, the top four being agents making the wrong 
input, the database malfunctioning, tasks being deleted incorrectly, and tasks with errors not being detected. From 
this, a new system was developed to prioritize the data entry and cleaning stage to make the process more efficient; 
thus, a data collection and management system (DCMS) was proposed to address these concerns. This study used the 
waterfall method of the systems development life cycle (SDLC) to build the DCMS. Once the DCMS was developed, 
it was tested and evaluated by the users involved in the file management process. The DCMS passed the functionality 
test, as it worked as intended. It also passed the usability test with a process sigma of 4.366. Furthermore, the loading 
time, transcription rate, and data cleaning time were reduced by 99.65%, 99.64%, and 99.41%, respectively. Overall, 
the new system was greeted with a positive attitude.

1. Introduction
In the age of information and technology, information systems (IS) are becoming increasingly valuable for many 
organizations and companies in managing data flow and making information available quickly and conveniently. For 
the case company, a business process outsourcing (BPO) provider based in the Philippines, an IS is helpful in tracking, 
monitoring, and organizing their agents’ tasks. As a BPO provider, the company caters to assist payment service 
providers (PSPs), who are third-party companies that help other companies accept a wide range of payment methods. 
One service the company provides is the merchant application process, wherein they verify the business’s capacity to 
accept payment safely and securely. This process also ensures that the business being onboarded is legitimate. Initially, 
the company was using the Task Collection Tool (TCT), a spreadsheet-based application designed to collect and 
monitor the tasks done by agents as they review a merchant’s application. The tool is also used to record the time it 
takes to do each task, which is then used as the basis for the company’s billing to its clients. All in all, the TCT is used 
for productivity reports, case assignment planning, and invoices.

more may cause the system to buffer or slow down. Currently, this is not considered a problem since 500 requests per 
second are already quite high and will need more than 70 active users to use the system simultaneously before any 
buffering can happen.  
 
On average, the DCMS has a loading time of 1.0437 seconds, which is within the acceptable software loading time. 
As for the transcription error rate, the development team reported seven occurrences of transcription error. Unlike in 
the TCT, where many transcription errors happen because of a system malfunction, these transcription errors were 
due to mistakes made by the agent, like choosing the wrong item in a dropdown list or radio button choices. This is 
because many input fields have been limited to radio buttons, dropdown lists, or numeric inputs, ensuring that answers 
to questions are standardized and less deviated from each other. Another reason is that the system is now free of 
system errors and malfunctions. Because the DCMS can now carry a high volume of data and still work smoothly, 
common transcription errors in the TCT can now be prevented. As for transcription errors that are due to human error, 
this is appended by using the “Request Record Change” event. These seven transcription errors translated to a rate of 
0.14%. Then, using CRUD functionalities also helped keep data cleaning time short. Using the CRUD functionalities, 
viewing and editing data records is now facilitated and more efficient. Moreover, this also helped simplify data 
cleaning. With the CRUD form, the admin no longer has to make edits in the actual database; instead, the administrator 
now has a user interface for data cleaning. The percentage decrease of the three metrics is shown in Table 10.

5.2. Proposed Improvements 
In the proposed plan for the DCMS, a dashboard was originally included so that agents could easily check their 
progress and admins could manage the tasks, database, and also make reports faster and more efficiently; however, 
due to time constraints, the dashboard was not added to the developed system. While the current system is working in 
great condition, having a dashboard will make it easier for both agents and admins to do their job. More than that, 
making reports and analyses will be more efficient and definitely faster if the users see and understand key 
performance indicators at a glance. 
 
Furthermore, an advantage of having a web-based system is that it can be accessible through any device. However, 
currently, the interface programmed for the system is only for computer and laptop monitors. For the DCMS to be 
more accessible, it is also recommended that a mobile interface be developed. Doing so will add convenience to agents 
who are doing their tasks. By having mobile access to the DCMS, the OaaS agents will be able to use other gadgets 
and have to resort to making a split screen or navigating between tabs when they do a task. 
 
Lastly, to make the account creation process easier for the admin, it is also recommended that a registration process 
be integrated into the DCMS. This will make the account creation process easier since the agents will decide their 
credentials, and most importantly, this will lessen the work admins have to do.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The company is a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) provider to the financial services industry. One of its main 
functions is Outsourcing as a Product (OaaS), which helps merchant banks onboard and manage their merchant clients. 
This includes various tasks like contacting customers, investigating their business, and more. The tasks of OaaS agents 
are then collected through the Task Collection Tool, which is an automated spreadsheet-based tool made by the author 
during her internship period.

The TCT has been used since 2021, when agents would log in an average of 30-40 tasks per day. Unfortunately, the 
system was incapable of carrying high data volume, making the system error-prone. Later on, this snowballed into 
numerous other problems like high loading time (with an average of 4.810 minutes), high data cleaning time (with an 
average of 6.183 hours), and high transcription error rate (with an average of 41%). It also made the OaaS agents resist 
using the system. Thus, to address the problems the TCT was currently facing, a data collection and management 
system (DCMS) was proposed. By doing so, this will help the task collection process be facilitated more efficiently 
and consistently.  
 
In developing the DCMS, the waterfall method of the Systems Development Life Cycle was used. The waterfall model 
started with a requirement analysis, in which the functional and functional requirements were identified. Furthermore, 
an interview was conducted with agents and the Business Development division so that their human comfort 
requirements would also be included. Then, use-case modeling was done to see the interactions between the system 
and the external users. Moreover, an entity relationship diagram was also made to depict the relations of entities within 
the system. Lastly, a data flow diagram was also made to see the flow of data and how the work is performed. 
 
Afterwards, the company programmers developed the system. Eight OaaS agents then tested the DCMS through 
functionality and usability tests. For the functionality test, 13 positive test cases and four negative test cases were 
identified for the users to test. Upon testing, no users encountered anything outside of the expected outcome. The 
Single Usability Test was used for the usability test. The task completion, time, error, and satisfaction were measured 
here. For this test, an SUM score of 2.8660 was derived, indicating that the interface of the system exceeded 
expectations. 
 
Next, with the integration of the DCMS, the new transcription error rate, data cleaning time, and loading time were 
taken. These new values were taken from the eight current users of the DCMS for two weeks from the time of the 
deployment. According to the development team’s internal report, the transcription error rate was reduced from 41% 
to 0.14%, which is a 99.65% decrease from the original transcription error rate. Next, the loading time was reduced 
from 288.6 seconds to 1.0437 seconds, a 99.64% decrease. Lastly, the data cleaning, which was initially 370.98 
minutes, decreased to 2.1781 minutes, a 99.41% decrease from the original value. 
 
All in all, the DCMS was greeted with a positive response from the users. Moreover, the DCMS greatly improved not 
just the users' attitude towards the system but also the productivity of the employees and the turnaround time for the 
reports. Lastly, the DCMS is a significant step forward for the company’s plan to use business analytics and make the 
company more data driven.

Abstract 
A mass transit system, such as a mass rail transit (MRT), offers a high-capacity, high-speed, and reliable mode of 
transportation. With the rapidly growing population and escalating urbanization rates, it is a sought-after solution to 
mobilize more people with fewer space requirements. However, existing MRT systems might still be challenged with 
long lines and overcrowding, particularly during peak times. This study explores the potential of introducing an 
express train service in addition to the existing local train routes without purchasing new trains. The MRT-3 line of 
the Philippines was used as a case study. Commuters in MRT-3 face challenges such as long queues and overcrowding 
during peak hours. A simulation-based approach was performed to build a virtual representation of the existing local 
train service and then tested how introducing an express train service affects the average stay time of passengers, the 
average number of passengers waiting on the station platform, and the train capacity utilization. The FlexSim 
simulation software was used for modeling. Official data from the Department of Transportation was used to model 
passenger arrivals and departures per hour per station. A total of 8 alternative models were built. Each alternative 
created a new line for express trains that bypasses some stations and stops only at select stations with high demand. 
Station selection was based on their historical foot traffic. The results indicate that all proposed express service models 
effectively reduce average stay time and platform congestion while increasing train utilization. Upon analyzing the 
changes in train utilization efficiency and daily foot traffic, the study recommends alternative 5, which has an express 
service that covers the six stations (out of 13) with the highest demand. The approach of this study offers valuable 
insights for improving urban transit systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable urban mobility and efficient 
public transport infrastructure. A cost analysis of introducing the express train service is recommended for future 
studies.

1. Introduction
Urban transportation systems are going through a paradigm shift to keep up with rapidly growing populations and 
escalating urbanization rates. Together with this are changes in travel preferences, digital transformation initiatives, 
and the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (Filippi 2022). The general direction is to provide efficient and 
sustainable solutions focusing on human-centric approaches. This is aligned with SDG 9 and SDG 11, which seek to 
build resilient infrastructure and encourage sustainable cities and communities. Current challenges include high 
passenger volumes that exceed capacity and strain the conventional transportation infrastructure, affecting how 
efficiently transportation systems operate.

4. Conclusions 
This study aimed to improve passenger experience and operational efficiency by introducing an express train service 
that coexists with the local train service. The specific objectives were to build a virtual representation of the existing 
local train service, evaluate the effects of introducing an express train service on key performance metrics, and identify 
the stations that should be included in the express train route. All these objectives were successfully met, and the study 
provides several unique contributions to the field of urban transportation systems. 
 
First, a detailed virtual representation of the existing local train service was developed using the discrete-event 
simulation software FlexSim. This virtual model accurately mimics the current system's operational dynamics, 
including train schedules, passenger arrival rates, and capacity constraints, serving as a robust platform for further 
analysis and scenario testing. 
 
Second, introducing an express train service was thoroughly evaluated in terms of its impact on the average stay time 
of passengers, the average number of passengers on the station platform, and train capacity utilization. The simulation 
results demonstrated that the express train service significantly reduced the average stay time of passengers and the 
average number of passengers on the station platform, thereby alleviating congestion and improving passenger 
experience. Moreover, the capacity utilization of trains was improved, indicating a more efficient use of the available 
resources without the need for additional trains. 
 
Third, the study identified the alternative combinations of stations for inclusion in the express train route based on 
total foot traffic. By focusing on stations with the highest passenger volumes, the express service effectively balanced 
the demand between peak and lean periods, enhancing overall system efficiency. All the alternatives were proven to 
be more effective than the current system. The study recommends alternative 5 for having the highest utilization 
efficiency, which accounts for 67% of daily foot traffic. This option could also provide balance since more stations 
for the express service would also mean more costs to be incurred in the construction. The study recommends further 
investigating the cost considerations in detail by providing a feasibility study.  
 
In conclusion, the introduction of an express train service, as illustrated by the simulation model, offers a viable 
solution to the pressing issues of overcrowding and inefficiency in local train services. The MRT-3 management can 
refer to the study for considerations of the results and use the base simulation model in case other scenarios are 
preferred to be tested in the future. The methodology developed, which includes simulation modeling of introducing 
an express train route without buying new trains and a decision-making framework through considering foot traffic,

is easily replicable across all other metro rail transit systems. Other regions can adapt the same method of analysis to 
provide more insights into improving the service operations of their train systems and encourage future research 
related to improving public mass transportation in general. This study provides a practical approach to capacity 
management and contributes valuable insights into the strategic planning of urban mass transit systems.

Abstract 
This work investigated the optimum parameters for the recovery of caesium alum (aluminium caesium sulphate 
dodecahydrate) from pollucite (caesium alumino silicate ore) obtained from Bikita in Zimbabwe by sulphuric acid 
leaching. The pollucite ore was characterized by AAS before leaching and after leaching. The mineralogical 
composition of the polucite ore before leaching was found to contain of the following phases: 17.17% aluminium 
oxide, 25.68% caesium oxide, 49.73% silica and less than 2% impurities of rubidium, potassium, sodium, lithium and 
iron. Batch optimisation studies were carried out to investigate the effects of process parameters namely leaching time 
and acid concentration at a constant temperature. -200 mesh size pollucite ore particles were digested in sulphuric acid 
at 100oC with a 30%-55% solution of sulphuric acid within a time frame of 1 – 6hs. Acid digestion was followed by 
hot water wash and vacuum filtration. Caesium alum was crystallized from the leach filtrate by stage cooling to room 
temperature.  Optimum conditions to achieve 90% mass recovery of caesium alum with caesium content of 23% 
analysed by AAS after leaching were, leach time of 4h at 100oC and acid concentration of 40%. It is possible to 
economically recover caesium alum from Bikita pollucite ore by sulphuric acid leaching.

1. Introduction
Caesium is an important rare metal element that has great application prospects in medical and biotechnology 
applications, atomic clock, oil drilling, as a getter in internet technology and space robotics and other contexts (Koch 
2002, Li and Xu 2015, Liu et al.2019). At present, the most important commercial source of caesium is the mineral 
pollucite, a caesium aluminium silicate, Cs2O.Al2O3.4SiO2 (Lee et al.2022).  Pollucite which is the ore of caesium, is 
found in a few zoned pegmatites around the world and is often associated with the more commercially important 
lithium ore, lepidolite. The deposits are sought and mined primarily for their lithium content. Almost all the world’s 
supply of caesium is from zoned pegmatites.  Pegmatites in the Bikita district of Zimbabwe and at Bernic Lake, 
Canada, contain the world’s two largest deposits of lepidolite and pollucite (Lu et al. 2022). 
Sulphuric acid leaching is the commercially preferred process because the method yields a sparingly soluble double 
salt without the need for another compound. The sulphuric acid leaching process of  caesium recovery from pollucite 
ore efficiency is influenced by several parameters that include acid concentration and leaching temperature. The 
process takes place at temperatures between 1000C and 180 0C with a 35% – 60% solution of acid followed by a water 
wash and vacuum filtration. Caesium alum is crystallized from the leach filtrate by stage cooling to 500C then 200C. 
The caesium alum is roasted in 4% carbon, the aluminium sulphate in the alum is converted to insoluble aluminium 
oxide. The resulting product (residue) is then leached with water to yield caesium sulphate which is then converted to 
caesium chloride. Reacting the aqueous caesium sulphate with barium azide gives caesium azide (CsN3). The caesium 
azide is decomposed at 3900C to caesium metal and nitrogen (Xie et al.2023). Optimizing these parameters is crucial

6. Conclusion 
The research conducted demonstrates that it is possible to economically recover 90% caesium from Bikita pollucite 
ore using sulphuric acid as a lixivant under optimum parameters; of raw material particle size -200 mesh, leach time 
of 4hs, temperature of 1000C and lixiviant concentration of 40%.  Reduction in acid dosage to 40% will reduce the 
chemical reagent usage in the recovery thereby reducing the cost of recovery and increasing the profit margins. It will 
also reduce the amount of free acid present in the effluent water, and this will reduce the amount of lime required to 
treat the water before disposing it to the environment. This will result in better compliance with the safety and 
environmental regulations.

Abstract 
Cement kiln dust (CKD) a hazardous waste product from cement kiln burning process was evaluated for its potential 
as a limestone substitute in cement making circular chemistry. CKD XRF elemental chemical analysis is similar to 
that of limestone making it a suitable replacement of limestone. The quantity of CKD waste generated is estimated to 
be 15-20% of the cement produced at Khayah Cement Limited Zimbabwe. Substitution of limestone with low-cost 
waste CKD will avoid environmental pollution, enhance waste utilisation, minimise land fill and reduce cement-
making cost. Experimental laboratory research design was used to make cement by substituting limestone with CKD. 
Ten batches of cement were made by milling 0 to 45% CKD as limestone substitute, limestone, clinker and gypsum 
using quantities obtained from Bogue cement making calculations. For each batch of cement milled full chemical 
analysis were performed using XRF before milling in order to calculate the Bogue clinker chemical parameters for 
cement making and after milling to verify compliance of cement specifications parameters of the cement produced. 
Cement strength and setting time tests results were evaluated in accordance with the Standards Association of 
Zimbabwe Specifications (SAZS) EN 196 and 197 test methods using the bricks made from the milled cement. The 
results obtained from the cement strength and setting time demonstrated that substitution of limestone with CKD up 
to 20% maximum produced a cement equivalent to Portland cement of 32.5 R and substitution up to 10% maximum 
produced a cement equivalent to 42.5 R (Superset). The cement test results obtained of up to 20% of limestone 
substitution with CKD complies with SAZS EN 196 and 197 cement specification requirements. CKD limestone 
substitution in cement making can be used to conserve limestone mining and lower the cost of cement making thus 
making a contribution to the resilient Zimbabwe circular economy.

Introduction
Cement kiln dust (CKD) is a significant by product material of cement manufacturing process. CKD is created in 
the kiln during production of cement clinker. The dust is a particular mixture of partially calcined and non-reacted 
raw feed, clinker dust, coal ash enriched with alkali, sulphates and other volatiles. (Bhatty ,2004).  The CKD is 
captured by the exhaust gases and collected in particular matter control devices called electrostatic precipitators 
(ESPs). It is the conveyed and dumped to the ground. The bulk of the dust is landfilled with significant 
environmental impact and loss to the manufacturing process in terms of the value of raw materials, processing and 
energy consumption during, dust collection and disposal. (Chatterjee, (2004). 
Investigation of CKD management in Lafarge group factories have shown that most plants employ the CKD land 
disposal alternative therefore in most plant the dust has accumulated in huge stock piles. (Lafarge group 
report,2008). From the previous studies it was found that the primary value of cement kiln dust is its cementation 
properties, therefore it can be used as a cement milling additive in replacement for limestone which is being currently

Figure 3. Percentage cement kiln dust added against cement setting time 
 
Figure 3 trend indicates that addition of more CKD in cement results in fast reaction of water and C3A and reduces 
setting time. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the cement batches made, substitution up to 20% maximum of limestone with CKD produced a cement 
equivalent to Portland cement (32.5 R) and substitution up to 10% maximum produced a cement equivalent to SupaSet 
(42.5 R). From the test results, it is recommended to use CKD as a limestone substitute in cement-making circular 
chemistry thus making a contribution to the Zimbabwe resilient circular economy.

Abstract 
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) strategy offset the operation delays, product defects, order declines, customer 
dissatisfaction and worker demoralization in a Manufacturing or service industry. This helps the company to achieve 
an increased Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) close to 95%. The study evaluated how TPM develops a high 
degree of utilization, reliability, and availability of the plant. The study showed an increase in machine efficiency by 
reducing set up times, defects, and total elimination of machine breakdowns. The 7S, Kanban, single minute 
exchange of dies (SMED) and OEE techniques enables the success of TPM. It was established that leadership enables 
the change in manufacturing culture by providing resources, job satisfaction and moral support. The leadership must 
avoid questionable decisions and unethical behaviour that cause harm to the organization by acts that makes them 
lose respect. TPM goes with respect for people (RFP), involvement and engagement in strategic planning to address 
the mental health and give job satisfaction.

Introduction
1.1 Background of Study
In South Africa, the Lean Manufacturing (LM)  philosophy has been adopted successfully in the Automotive Supply
Chain ( SC) who have multiple suppliers and customers. Other industries have relatively small suppliers and
customers and cannot implement all LM techniques to increase productivity. Productivity is improved by increasing
plant availability and reducing the eight (8) waste. To increase plant availability such industries have adopted the
Total Productive Maintenance strategy that reduces downtimes, improves performance, machine life, job, and
customer satisfaction.

The quality of products is maximized by an accurate machine set up to ensure 100% quality test at each station to 
prevent passage of defect from one machine to the next. 
TPM removes the expensive unscheduled breakdowns characterized by long waiting period for spares whilst work in 
progress materials are damaged and scraped.

Figure 4. The effective TPM Framework for Manufacturing and Service industries. 
The working life of the machine increases because of preventing breakdowns and keeping the machine in tip top 
condition all the times. The machines are well lubricated and run at the prescribed correct speeds. TPM is a problem-
solving approach that uses the 5WHY analysis to  get to the root cause before eliminating it and increase the OEE. 
The training and empowering in TPM motivates the employees who increase their operation rates to increase 
productivity. Breakdowns and defects are minimum under TPM thus customer quality is attained, and energy costs 
improves at reduced maintenance cost. The inventory in the production floors is reduced by balancing the machines 
and subordinate any bottlenecks. The workers get a feeling of owning the organization and improve their 
innovativeness. This strengthens the team to work together cohesively towards a common goal, using different skill 
sets and knowledge that enhances performance. Collaborations, sharing of knowledge and experience on TPM must 
be strengthened during the deployment of a new concept in all areas of the organization.

Conclusions
TPM is instrumental in reducing the eight wastes in manufacturing when it is aligned to other LM techniques. It forms 
the strategic vision and planning of clear goals to manage the resources for long term gains. The principle steers the 
ship in the right direction  by respecting people to minimise stress, turnover, absenteeism, and burnout and embrace 
innovation and adaptation to new opportunities. It embraces an effective talent management to create a safe, strong, 
resilient team that can take the business to new heights. Too much ego by taking credit for other people's work is 
buried by TPM since it is a recipe for disaster. Employees are treated equally in their position and any resistance to 
learning new concepts and methods become outdated.  TPM embraces continuous learning, open feedback that help 
leaders stay relevant and effective. The engagement and involvement management culture  educate, train workers to 
upgrade the skill and technical capabilities of the production and maintenance staff to produce the right quality the 
customer needs.

Abstract 
As science and technology develop, there is a non-negligible contradiction between the cost of the shooting system 
and the requirements for image quality in the machine vision system. Light field cameras are of great significance for 
3D reconstruction, virtual reality and other fields, where there is a high demand for high quality images. However, 
high-quality component images imply a high cost. Super-resolution, as an image processing technology, provides the 
possibility of balancing high quality with low cost. Deep learning-based super-resolution methods outperform 
traditional methods in image quality enhancement but require plenty of high-resolution images for training. Therefore, 
we explored how to use low-resolution light field images and a small number of high-resolution images in the same 
scene to generate corresponding high-resolution images. This research utilized a network based on an attention 
mechanism to achieve reference-based super-resolution and improve light field image clarity. Experiments were 
conducted on a public light field image dataset, and the results show that the method greatly improves the resolution 
of the original image.

1. Introduction
A light field is a complete representation of light rays in space, which is conducive to a real-world visual reproduction. 
In a conventional camera, each pixel can only capture light information at a specific position, whereas a light field 
camera can capture light information in different directions at each pixel position through an array of microlenses. 
This allows more light information to be obtained, resulting in light field images that are different from conventional 
two-dimensional images. It can capture the propagation and interaction of light in three-dimensional space, and 
therefore provide more depth and orientation information, which helps to understand and process image data more 
accurately. This has led to a wide range of applications for light-field imagery, including, but not limited to, 
computational photography, virtual and augmented reality, medical imaging, machine vision and 3D reconstruction 
(Jin et al., 2023). 
In machine vision, there is always an urgent need for high-resolution (HR) images, and the same is true for light-field 
images. Richer information is contained in images with higher resolutions. Nevertheless, HR photographs are 
frequently unattainable due to the limits of image sensors and image acquisition hardware. According to Yang and 
Huang (2017), the spatial resolution of a picture is limited by technical constraints on sensor size. Therefore, HR 
cameras are prohibitively expensive and impractical for most practical uses. In addition, the storage cost of HR images 
is one of the reasons that limit the acquisition of HR images (Cheng et al., 2022). Specifically, because light-field 
images need to capture more information than conventional images, this requires higher sampling rates and more 
sophisticated imaging equipment to capture this information, and processing this information also requires greater 
computational power. Therefore, obtaining HR light field images requires more advanced imaging techniques and

5. Conclusion 
The attention mechanism is utilized to implement reference-based super-resolution for quality enhancement of light 
field images. The method utilizes a LR light field image and a HR 2D image of the same scene to enhance the 
performance of the light field image super-resolution while controlling the shooting cost of the camera, thus achieving 
a balance between cost and quality. Attention mechanism is used to match and transfer the texture of the reference 
image, and spatial-angular convolution is used to extract complementary information between LR images. Therefore, 
the model can transfer high-frequency details of an image to other LR images, resulting in super-resolution images 
with sharper edge textures. At the same time, the shooting cost of the light field camera is limited because only one 
viewpoint of the HR image is used. In addition, since a light field image can be viewed as images from multiple 
viewpoints, the method can also be extended to other multi-view images SR. However, this method has a long 
computation time for the model when implementing SR at large angular resolutions due to the calculation of similarity 
between images. Next, this issue will be addressed by reducing the model runtime while keeping the model 
performance constant. In addition, it is desirable to use fewer HR images to train the model to reduce costs. Therefore, 
unsupervised training methods will be explored to make it more suitable for real industrial scenarios.

Abstract 
Through the application of Lean Manufacturing methodology, using the 5S tool and taking process times, for a pilot 
test in a delimited space of the storage area and the respective validation with the use of the Arena simulator, an 
efficiency improvement of 54.72% is achieved concerning the amount of finished product arriving at the warehouse; 
likewise, a reduction in waiting times and total storage3 time of 82.80% and 66.71%, respectively, is achieved. In 
summary, the article presents a significant contribution in the use of key tools, demonstrating improvement in 
processes in favor of productive efficiency.

1. Introduction
Currently, there is a high level of competitiveness among different industries, where the warehouse plays an essential 
role in the supply chain of companies. As the idea of developing excellent customer service grows, organizations see 
the need to generate warehouses with a more efficient flow, being able to protect themselves from variations in demand 
levels (Zahra et al. 2019). In this sense, the term ""warehouse"" is a physical space in which certain types of products 
and/or materials are received, transferred, sorted, and shipped from one point to another (Cakmak et al. 2012). 
Aligned with this constant increase in the need for an efficient warehouse flow, different authors expose the different 
recurring problems that delay and/or affect the development of this objective, which can be linked to the structure and 
placement of the warehouse (Palange and Dhatrak 2021) as well as in the timing of the realization of the storage 
process (Muñoz-Villamizar et al. 2021). 
However, making the necessary changes to adapt the warehouse to a new workflow may generate certain delays due 
to its daily necessity within the normal processes of organizations. In this sense, simulation is a viable option to solve 
these implementation problems, capturing the problems and possible solutions virtually, and being able to generate 
better decision-making related to storage (Emami et al. 2014). 
This will be followed by a review of the state of the art. Then, the theoretical framework will be developed, which 
will explain concepts related to the warehouse and the different ways to solve the existing problems. Subsequently,

highly promising, as they demonstrate the effectiveness of Arena software in optimizing logistics processes and 
reducing times; by implementing this approach in the warehousing area, substantial improvements in efficiency and 
productivity can be achieved, which in turn has a positive impact on operating costs and response time in the delivery 
of materials (Table 6).

6. Conclusion 
While the company may have a system of order in place, it is important to develop a visual plan and carry out 
awareness-raising to ensure an efficient implementation of the 5S methodology compared to the initial state. Through 
this methodology, we were able to verify that the commitment of the entire organization, from top management to 
operators, is fundamental to achieving significant improvements in the company. 
 
If the data is not properly configured, there could be errors when using different simulation software available on the 
market. Therefore, it is crucial to make sure that the parameters are accurate and representative of reality to obtain 
reliable results and make informed decisions. In the same way, the lean manufacturing methodology provides a 
structured work framework, through the application of a set of tools, which facilitates the adoption of improvement 
proposals that are affordable for the company and innovative and easy to understand for the collaborators.  However, 
it is necessary to train the collaborators in these tools and methodologies for their internalization and maintenance 
over time.

Abstract 
Centrifugal Slurry Pump (CSP) is one of the most important fluid transportation equipment, widely applied in 
processing plants. We conduct Reliability Growth Analysis (RGA) on two CSPs, i.e. 352PU342 and 352PU343, in a 
mineral processing plant at Western Australia (WA), both of which are repairable systems and work in duty-standby 
mode, to evaluate their maintenance performance during an impeller material transition from metal to rubber. Three 
Units of Measures (UoMs), i.e. Operating Time (𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂), Cumulative Mass (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶), and Effective Work (𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸), are 
employed to accurately quantify the service life of CSPs, the last one of which is constructed by hydraulic modeling 
and firstly applied in RGA on CSP with embedding the working mechanism, and therefore can better represent the 
service life. Laplace Test is firstly conducted and reveals the improving performance trends for the CSPs during the 
impeller transition. Then, two Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) hypothesis tests, i.e. Cramér-von Mises (CVM) Test and 
Common Beta Hypothesis (CBH) Test, are implemented in sequence to validate that the failure and overhaul data of 
some of the combinations between impeller and UoM fits Power Law Model, in which the wear-out failure patterns 
of the CSPs are identified. Finally, economical life models are developed to find out the optimum overhaul interval, 
i.e. economical life, and the associated minimum average life cost per unit service life for each qualified combination,
based on which the overhaul policy simulations of the qualified combinations over an actual operating time frame are
compared to figure out the one incurring the lowest total cost, i.e. achieving more than 96.5% cost reduction compared
to the current overhaul policy. This study paves the way for massively applying RGA on other critical repairable
systems in processing plants, and further lays a solid foundation for Preventative Maintenance Optimisation (PMO),
to unlock the hidden substantial value of the existing assets and comply with the relevant Australian Standard (AS).

9. Conclusion 
In this study, we conducted RGA on two CSPs in a mineral processing plant at WA, i.e. 352PU342 and 352PU343, 
which experienced a transition from metal to rubber impeller, by employing Laplace Test and Power Law Model. To 
accurately measure the service life and evaluate the performance of the CSPs, three UoMs, i.e. 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶, and 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸, 
were constructed and employed, the last one of which is firstly applied in RGA on CSP with the working mechanism 
informed, and thus can better measure the service life. 
 
Laplace Test indicated the decreasing trends of the failure rates of the CSPs during the impeller material transition at 
the 0.105 significance level. Two GoF hypothesis tests, i.e. CVM Test and CBH Test, validated that the failure and 
overhaul data of the five of six combinations between UoM and impeller fitted Power Law Model, which furtherly 
revealed the wear-out failure patterns of the CSPs, at the significance level of 0.2 and 0.1, respectively. 
Based on the adjusted Power Law parameters, economical life models were established to determine 𝑇𝑇𝑂𝑂 and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂 in 
the selected combinations, the overhaul policies based on which were simulated in the actual working scenario to 
identify the one offering the best cost optimization. Finally, it is recommended to implement the CSPs overhaul policy 
in the interval of 1.49E+05 (kw.h) by using the metal impeller and 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 to minimize the total cost, i.e. achieving over 
96.5% cost reduction compared to the existing eight-calendar-weeks overhaul policy with using both metal and rubber 
impeller. 
 
This study successfully validated the feasibility of conducting RGA based on the high-quality field data, and moreover 
can serve as a standard procedure and technical guide to widely conduct RGA on other critical repairable systems, 
such as conveyor belt, in processing plants for substantial cost reduction, which will not only revolutionise the existing 
Preventive Maintenance (PM) strategies and tactics on repairable systems in the processing plant, to furtherly lay a 
solid foundation for Preventive Maintenance Optimisation (PMO), but also work as one of two cornerstones or pillars 
in the best industrial practices in reliability engineering and asset health or management sector, including but not 
limited to Reliability Block Diagram (RBD), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Markov State Space (MSS) and Monte Carlo 
Simulation (MCS), and more importantly comply with the latest Australian Standard (AS) and International Standard 
(IS), i.e. AS/NZS IEC 61710:2020 and IEC 61710:2013, to furtherly unlock the hidden value of the existing assets. 
Future research should involve more data sets with larger scales and employ more localized UoMs strongly correlated 
to the most dominant failure modes, such as energy dissipation, the integral of thermal and vibration signals over time, 
to further improve the accuracy of RGA and thus reduce the total cost to the maximum extent. Moreover, detailed 
cost-benefit analysis and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) modeling should be conducted to further optimise the maintenance 
strategies of the CSPs.

1. Introduction
The field of spacecraft engineering is currently facing pressing challenges that demand a radical shift in approach. The 
urgent need to develop propulsion-aware, latency-free steered spacecraft capable of efficiently managing the growing 
problem of space debris is a clear indication that the current methods are insufficient. Considering numerous failures 
by space agencies and the impending tests, a new and innovative approach to spacecraft engineering is desirable and 
necessary designed for the planet's well-being rather than narrow space agency scopes. 
Traditional additive manufacturing has yet to enable successful sustainable businesses in the space sector. This 
research provides a turnkey solution for a sustainable space economy. The motivation for this study stems from the 
recognition that a space economy game-changer was discovered in 2023 through the integration of surgical and 
aerospace technologies, establishing a new research area. 
1.1 Objectives 
The primary objectives of this research are: 
1.
To demonstrate a spacecraft design based on current market-available technologies, presented in a process
diagram that achieves a standard 44-47 V efficiency range for optimal aerospace engineering application.
2.
To integrate a power inlet system that seamlessly connects through battery system management to high-
performance power packs with adjustable topology.
3.
To develop a sustainable operation system for space debris management, incorporating autonomous lasers
and AI through aerospace cyber trucking design.
4.
To explore the integration of BCIs (brain-computer interfaces) into manufacturing processes, particularly in
the context of establishing a new bio-metaverse 2.0.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
As per Figure 3 validation representing a 3D rendered model of a key component, a part of the debris collection or 
processing system. Its sleek, multi-ringed design suggests a focus on most efficient space utilization and functionality. 
Based on the visual analysis, several improvements are proposed in connecting to sales to request further information:

shown to provide more intuitive spacecraft control schematics, 
1. 
The additive manufacturing capabilities (G++) could be expanded, and 
2. 
The debris collection mechanism (Figure 2) could benefit from representing all systems of the 
system. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The detailed specifications provided in Figure 1 reveal the design validation process. Different components' surface 
finish requirements (Ra values) demonstrate a rigorous approach to ensuring optimal performance finishing surface 
for the space environment super durability and aesthetics. Including multiple views and precise measurements in the 
engineering drawings indicates a thorough design process. 
 
Integrating advanced systems, such as the ion x thrusters and the atomizing Y outlet (Figure 2), is a strategic move 
that aligns with our goal of leading a project to develop a sustainable and efficient spacecraft for debris management. 
Using a PLC for control further underscores our commitment to industry standards and reliability requirements, which 
no PLC has a stance and a proper educational service for the lifecycle.

design for space debris management. The integration of additive manufacturing, advanced propulsion, and precise 
control systems demonstrates a forward-thinking solution to the pressing issue of orbital debris.

Abstract 
Indonesia is the largest CPO producer in the world, where around 59.1% or more than half of the world's palm oil 
market needs are produced by Indonesia or as much as 45.5 million tons in 2023. From the production of oil palm 
plantations, about 50% is wastewater known as POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent). The release of POME into the 
environment can cause environmental problems such as water and soil pollution that causes damage to aquatic 
ecosystems and eutrophication, in addition to air pollution due to carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen sulfide gases 
which are the main causes of climate change. The Indonesian government is committed to reducing gas emissions by 
29% by 2030, so the government issued Permentan No. 38 of 2020 concerning Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil 
(ISPO) to ensure the creation of sustainability standards for the palm oil industry in Indonesia. Effort that can be made 
by the palm oil industry to support government programs is by processing POME that must adjust the waste 
management criteria determined by the RSPO. One way that can be applied in POME treatment is to use nanobubble 
AOP technology for wastewater treatment that will be released to the environment because of its ability to remove 
various types of contaminants without using chemicals in wastewater treatment. The objective of this study is to 
analyze the commercial feasibility of POME treatment using nanobubble AOP technology. The method used in 
assessing the feasibility of POME processing is the Business Model Canvas (BMC) which considers the Payback 
Period (PP), Return On Investment (ROI), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) values. Based on the calculation results, 
POME processing is feasible to commercialize with the revenue value coming from two main activities, namely water 
re-use processing and converting waste into organic fertilizer, which will produce a PP value of 1 year and 4 months, 
an ROI value of 64,22%, and an IRR value of 65,85%.

1. Introduction
Based on the Commodity Intelligence Report compiled by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 
Indonesia is named the world's largest producer and supplier of palm oil, reaching 59.1% of the world's total palm oil 
demand, or 46 million tons in 2023 (United State Department of Agriculture, 2023). The total area of oil palm 
plantations in Indonesia in 2024 has reached 15.434 million hectares, with a national average productivity level of 
3.36 tons/ha/year (BPS, 2024; SPKS, 2024).  For Indonesia, the palm oil industry also plays an important role as the 
largest export commodity, reaching a value of $28.6 billion (Direktorat Jendral Perkebunan, 2023). In addition to the 
agricultural sector, palm oil has also played a role in the energy sector, where it has been developed into vehicle fuel, 
namely biodiesel, since 2006, supported by Government Regulation No. 32/2006 (Sipayung, 2024). The production 
of oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB), which will later be processed into Crude Palm Oil (CPO), solid waste, and

The PP calculation results show that the time required to return the initial investment value in the POME management 
business using AOP Nanobubble is 1 year and 4 months, which is less than the preference time determined by previous 
researchers. Therefore, we can conclude that the POME management business employing AOP Nanobubble is viable 
and carries a comparatively minimal business risk. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The waste products of the palm oil industry in Indonesia in the form of POME reach 50%, or around 2.5 to 3.37 tons 
per one ton of FFB, increasing the production of greenhouse gas emissions. In an effort to reduce these emissions, the 
government issued a policy MOA No. 38 of 2020 related to the ISPO (Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil) standard. 
The Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) Nanobubble method, which can oxidize various types of contaminants, is 
one of the alternatives for POME management. The feasibility analysis reveals that commercializing POME 
processing using AOP Nanobubble is viable, as evidenced by its NPV value of IDR 2,240,332,703, IRR of 65.85%, 
ROI of 64.22%, and payback period of 1 year and 4 months. Therefore, the palm oil industry can apply AOP 
Nanobubble technology to treat POME, anticipating a more efficient and eco-friendly wastewater treatment solution.

Abstract 
Adaptive reuse of buildings plays a key role in achieving circularity in the built environment. Despite the number of 
studies that focus on the adaptive reuse of built environments on different scales, a limited focus has been given to 
conceptualizing the adaptive reuse of buildings as a circular economy accelerator. It is important to grasp how adaptive 
reuse aligns with circular economy in built environment. As the first step, this paper reviews the existing body of 
knowledge on adaptive reuse buildings as a circular economy accelerator. This study employed the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology to conduct the Systematic 
Literature Review (SLR). Scopus and Web of Science databases were utilized to search articles, and 60 peer-reviewed 
journal articles published between 2013 and 2024 were retrieved for further analysis. Descriptive analysis of selected 
studies revealed that the majority of the publications were from Italy (25%). This study classified three key research 
themes based on extant literature: (1) Policy and planning for adaptive reuse and circularity, (2) Sustainability 
attributes for circularity, and (3) multi-criteria decision and evaluation tools for circularity. This study provides insight 
into how circularity can be integrated into adaptive reuse building projects. As an emerging field, findings herein are 
significant for academics and industry practitioners to broaden the knowledge of current status, research gaps and 
emerging trends on the adaptive reuse of buildings as a circular economy accelerator.

1. Introduction
The growing emphasis on environmental crises and economic impact due to the excessive use of natural resources has 
provoked the topic of circular economy. In contrast to a linear economic model, which is characterized by extracting 
virgin materials, making them used and disposing at the end of the lifecycle of the product (Hossain et al., 2020), the 
circular economy helps to slow and close the resource loops by expanding the product life and minimizing the waste 
through reusing and recycling the material (Moraga et al., 2019). Recently, achieving a circular economy has become 
one of the prime focuses of many industries (Gamage et al., 2024). Nevertheless, the literature discovers that there is

5. Conclusion  
Adaptive reuse of buildings has been identified as a promising approach for promoting a circular economy in the built 
environment.  This study has explored the emergence of literature on the adaptive reuse of buildings as a circular 
economy accelerator. PRISMA protocol was employed for article selection, and 60 peer-reviewed journal articles 
spanning from 2013 to 2024 were selected for the analysis. Descriptive and bibliometric analysis of selected articles 
discover the trends and key themes in extant literature. Globally, adaptive reuse is a growing concept in the built 
environment. However, it has been revealed that most of the research was carried out in Europe, which opens up the 
debate about the need for more research on adaptive reuse building projects to accelerate the circular economy in other 
regions of the world. The keyword co-occurrence network revealed three clusters, which denote key research themes 
in the adaptive reuse of buildings research from a circular economy perspective. These clusters are Cluster (1) Policy 
and Planning for Adaptive Reuse and Circularity, Cluster (2) Sustainability Attributes for Circularity, and Cluster (3) 
Multi-criteria Decision and Evaluation Tool for Circularity.  
 
This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive overview of the current status of 
the research in the adaptive reuse of buildings from a circular economy perspective and provides valuable insight into 
adaptive reuse practices towards circular economy transition. The key research themes revealed in this study provide 
theoretical implications and future research directions. Accordingly, there are opportunities to develop future research 
on (1) developing policies and protocols to overcome barriers identified in these studies and for efficient 
transformation of adaptive reuse projects towards circularity, (2) integrating modern technologies and tools for 
achieving optimized circularity performance, (3) applying project planning approaches aside from disassembly 
sequence planning, (4) developing advanced approaches to verify the environmental and economic impact (5) 
simulating a regenerative capacity in order to achieve social sustainability and (6) establishing macro-level circularity 
indicators for adaptive reuse projects based on different geographical context. These observations can guide scholars, 
practitioners, and policymakers in understanding various aspects of the circular economy and promote adaptive reuse 
building projects as circular economy accelerators. This research has inherent limitations related to systematic 
literature reviews, such as being limited to two databases, Scopus and WOS. Since this is a growing research topic, 
future review studies are recommended to capture the evolving knowledge.

Abstract 
In the implementation of Lean manufacturing (LM) the focus was to eliminate the barriers within the ten generic 
barrier areas to achieve a remarkable  success. The Automotive Supply Chain (ASC) in South Africa (SA) found these 
ten generic barrier areas insufficient because of the culture mix, level of education of employees, religion, and cultural 
values. To optimize the implementation of LM the ASC in SA found seven new barrier areas that needs subordination. 
The seven barrier areas are not yet documented as critical in the academic work.  The seven areas are Green 
Technologies, workers, sustenance, safety, security, profitability, and Marketing, but are discussed elsewhere with no 
relation to implementing LM. These have increased the success rate  in the SA setting. Some of these technologies are 
broken down to subunits because they involve many attributes. The study will elaborate the generic ten critical areas 
then discuss the seven as findings in the ASC in SA.

5.7 Core Values 
The core values aim to build mutual trust, RFP, quality, collaboration, and innovation to meet the customer needs by 
initiating change to LM. Building trust and transparency in the control and handling of all inventories has added 
success to LM. The quick response in the change of product in the value stream has improved efficiency and reliability 
in ASC. 90% of the Core Value area has made LM successful in the ASC. Education and awareness on the Core values 
of the organization is available on charts and company television (TV) in the company library and canteens. The Core 
Values and outstanding lean technique are screened on company TV during lunch time to remind, update the 
employees on pertinent issues, provide feedback on success factors and announce the award-winning teams. 
 
5.8 Proposed improvements 
The implementation of LM can be done by benchmarking industries that uses similar machines and materials. This 
help in collaboration and providing appropriate training to the workforce.  The building up green scrap technologies 
is easily done when benchmarking an industry that has similar functions. 
 
5.9 Significance of the new areas 
The new barrier areas improve the implementation success rate by facilitating Cleaner Production plant operations to 
sustain the business and its core values. Use of green materials allows the materials to be reused at the end of their 
life.  
 
Obsolete materials are raw materials for downstream industries which buy them to generate income. All plastic 
products from thermosets are ground and used as fillers and strengtheners. Some are used as fuel for energy recovery 
supplements in furnaces such as brick kilns. Thermoplastics are recycled and used to make cheaper structural products 
and toys.  
 
Green manufacturing processes cleanse the emissions of any toxic substances to prevent pollution. Use of activated 
carbon catalysts in auto exhaust systems reduces atmospheric pollution otherwise in cities where you have many cars 
the atmospheric gases would be chalking. The security of employees allows CI and productivity at the expense of the 
generic 8 waste. The safety of workers, equipment and machinery enforces the Standard operating Procedures in 
manufacturing to meet the customer needs.  
 
Car breakers have created employment opportunities for people who strip old parts from accident damaged parts for 
reuse. The old parts are reconditioned and companies like Barnet and Mandos have established mutual trust with the 
manufacturers and service garages who get parts from these car breakers. The companies meet the core values of the 
customers. The 2nd hand Toyota parts spares outlet is available at Barnet, Toyo parts, and Car breakers such as 
Mando’s and others resale used parts to repair companies and individuals.  
 
The damaged body parts are sold to plastic and metal recycling companies where they are processed to form raw 
materials at the smelters to sustain the demand for raw materials. Metal scrap dealers buy scrap metal and supply the 
smelters for further processing.  Plastic companies recycle thermoplastics whilst the thermosets are used as fillers or 
fuels for low temperature furnaces. Rubber materials are used by REDISA to form carpets, tiles stadium lawn to 
mention but a few. Metal waste is sold to scrap metal sales company for recycling. Employment opportunities and 
experiential training is offered by most companies that recycle and recondition parts. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The ASC industry has adopted the upgraded 7S techniques and another upgrade may come since they practice CI. The 
new generic areas are used to retain employees, provide safety at work, and generate income to increase profitability. 
The new areas spearhead the setting up of downstream industries that consume scrap for recycling, stock, and sale old 
parts at car breakers which are a lifeline to many people. 
 
The environment is cleaned of the scrap and old parts by scavengers who collect the automotive debris and sell usable 
parts to secondhand shops and recycling plants.  These benefits are coming from the upgraded generic areas that uses 
green materials and processes. Academics and industry can use it as a generic framework to educate, train and 
empower the users in  industry with modifications to suit their specific needs. Academics will use the knowledge to 
educate and train the students who will use the knowledge when they graduate and join the field of work. During their

studies they can use the knowledge to implement LM in the workshops and laboratories. Figure 2. shows a framework 
with both generic and upgraded barrier areas that are to adopter LM. Similarly, the companies that have already failed 
using the generic barrier areas can analyze the new framework and use it for the second attempt.

Abstract 
The electric vehicle market is positioned for significant growth, driving a major reduction in carbon emissions. A 
crucial element underpinning this growth is the sustainable management of supply chains for critical minerals essential 
for electric vehicle battery production, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. This research merges principles 
of economics, engineering, and environmental science to promote a sustainable, competitive, and equitable market 
environment for critical mineral supply chains. This research proposes a Dynamic Pricing Framework that adapts to 
governmental incentives, embodies circular economy principles, and leverages technological advancements in 
artificial intelligence as a solution for sustainable supply chain management of critical minerals.

1. Introduction
The Electric Vehicle (‘EV’) market has seen a surge in consumer interest, and sales are expected to reach 45 million 
by 2030. A concern in the EV battery supply chain is the geographic concentration of critical mineral reserves and 
supply chain activities. For example, China’s dominance over certain stages of supply chain presents a major source 
of geopolitical risk. Furthermore, the environmental and social impacts of mining activities are profound, leading to 
human rights violations and environmental degradation as seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo (‘DRC’) and 
Indonesia. These necessitate a holistic approach to uphold human rights and ensure environmental integrity, alongside 
the core objective of securing critical minerals.  
The motivation of research in this context is that there is a significant deficiency in the pricing models applied to 
critical minerals. Criticality of this oversight becomes more acute with geopolitical concentration, and the consistent 
oversight of environmental and social costs in their pricing. The absence of a pricing framework with widespread 
stakeholder endorsement presents a significant gap, undermining both the supply chain’s resilience and longevity. The 
effectiveness of advanced pricing strategies in other sectors signals a clear need for innovative methods applicable to 
the critical minerals domain – a need that has not been adequately addressed by existing research. Dynamic pricing 
has become imperative for enterprises aiming to harness the full potential of the contemporary commercial 
environment, driving both immediate returns and sustainable economic growth.  
1.1 Objectives 
This research aims to develop a Dynamic Pricing Framework (‘DPF’) intended to promote a sustainable, competitive, 
and equitable market environment for supply chain management in the EV battery market. The DPF dynamically 
prices critical minerals by integrating real-time market data, governmental interventions, and sustainability metrics to

Figure 3. Case study 3 results 
 
6.4 Discussion on Results 
In case study 1, the optimal price is calculated as 74.96 while the expected profit in this case would be 23811. These 
values are 71.85 and 3375.62 for case study 2 and 78.03 and 22754 for case study 3. These values mean that for each 
case study, the framework suggests an optimal price range where profitability is maximized while considering all the 
inputs such as policies, circularity, and ESG inputs. The provided confidence interval helps in making realistic pricing 
strategies by providing a range within which the optimal price is expected to fall. The addressed variability in the 
model is essential for stakeholders to understand as it affects the formulation of realistic and dynamic pricing 
strategies. The stability and predictability of optimal price are crucial for making informed decisions, especially for 
the EV industry which drives the demand for natural graphite. 
 
Case 2 demonstrates the highest expected profit with the highest standard deviation. On the other hand, Case 3 
demonstrates lower standard deviation in profit profile compared to case 1 and 2. This means case study 3 offers lower 
financial risks compared to other cases.  
 
The profit distribution of all three cases illustrates a relatively narrow spread, likely due to the law of large numbers, 
indicating higher predictability and replicability in results. This reliability is essential for creating dependable and 
effective pricing models, especially when proving the bankability of companies. 
 
The proposed sensitivity analysis approach allows analyzing the influence of specific factors on the pricing model, 
providing an itemized view of how each parameter affects costs and pricing strategies which can be expanded upon 
in future iterations. Case 3 has better circular economy initiatives compared to case study 1. While in case study 1 the 
variable cost and fixed cost is lower, and demand is higher which is a more favorable situation. The better values for 
circular economy, although might lead to additional costs but result in long-term savings via sustainable practices. To 
cover the initial costs associated with the circular economy practices the optimal price is calculated higher for case 
study 3. This highlights not only the costs incurred but also the significant improvement in the company’s market 
reputation and investor confidence. 
 
7. Conclusion and Future Work 
The dependence on limited and potentially geopolitically unstable regions for critical mineral supplies exacerbates 
supply chain vulnerabilities and threatens the security of supply. This work proposed a framework with DPF as a 
solution to this challenge, fulfilling the stated research objective. The strategic depth of this approach is reinforced by 
the model’s implementation and validation, which paves the way for future developments, including the integration 
of real-time market data. Such expansion can significantly enhance the model’s predictive capabilities and its 
adaptability to dynamic market conditions.  
 
The preliminary outputs of the model serve as a platform for devising dynamic pricing strategies that encapsulate the 
true fair value of critical minerals extracted through diversified, sustainable practices. The model’s capacity for data 
integration positions it to conduct thorough assessments of ESG compliance and evaluate macroeconomic and 
geopolitical risks, emphasizing the strategic advantage of diverse sourcing methodologies. The proposed approach 
can support diversification by reducing reliance on single sources, particularly from geopolitically unstable regions, 
which enhances supply chain resilience and stability, ensuring a consistent supply of natural graphite. This 
422","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

diversification can be further supported by the bankability of new critical minerals production companies. The 
proposed approach can cover the implications of various scenarios simulated through different scenarios; indeed, the 
standard deviation analysis of optimal prices and profits signifies predictable outcomes and lower financial risks.

6. Conclusion  
In summary, IE’s have the strategic advantages of adding value in the Australian Supply Chain Management. With 
increasing channels of challenges across the Regional, Remote locations, IEs have enough power and knowledge to 
integrate professional knowledge into play. Digitalization of an interesting phenomenon that feeds datasets into 
algorithms that can cluster data, recognize patterns, minimize costs, maximize profit, handle changes, and signalling 
departments back and forth to improve accuracy and resilience in Supply Chain Management. Furthermore, datasets 
are crucial to successful machine learning concepts that analyse data effectively for a comprehensive solution. The 
more data, the better the solutions in the workplace environment. Handling such challenges with computational power 
and energy is essential for company growth and professional values adding prospects in the Australian Industry. 
Though challenges are abundant, innovation and advanced machine learning techniques can address the hurdles to 
enhance wellbeing and hit KPI’s with strong acumen. Applications can range from any industry to government sector 
in the global perspective paradigm. Literature Review enhances accuracy from sources that capture the workplace 
environment for adding values through innovation, methods, models, and suitable data collection methods that 
articulate profound meaning in the industry. It pays to use the data to analyse in specific notions of improvements, 
design models, and retrieve impactful results to proposed improvements and validation methods that guarantee a 
rewarding benefit-based meritocracy. In a future of technological enhancements, IEs have the qualitative and 
quantitative capacity to partially integrate Machine Learning solutions into the Supply Chain Management. With gains 
and perspective, Machine Learning is an empowering tool that shapes future demands and oppositions. One can 
definitely partially combine innovation and machine learning for a more powerful combination to enhance problem 
solving features in a world of supply chain management, focusing on more successful applications.

Abstract 
The Automotive Supply Chain (ASC) industries in South Africa (SA) are thriving to eliminate the bottlenecks by 
implementing Lean Manufacturing (LM) techniques in the production line. The paper seeks to identify the bottlenecks 
by Gemba walks and develop methods to eliminate the eight wastes using the theory of constrains (TOC) and the 
Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis techniques. The bottleneck is exploited using the 
(TOC), error proofing Poka Yoka and intelligent Jidoka tools on the production machines. The use of green materials, 
trained personnel, good housekeeping, and inventory control together with a safe and health work environment 
increased throughput rates to meet customer needs and job satisfaction. The Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) 
was used to correct the looming machine failure and improve the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of Study
Companies that manufacture automotive parts are finding stiff global competition when it comes to strength,
reliability, and quality of their products. This is worsened by another handicap, the bottleneck phenomenon that
shrinks production and causes customer and worker dissatisfaction. The auto parts manufacturers supply popular
Automotive Assembly companies namely Nissan, Ford, Volkswagen (VW) and Toyota that require thousands of auto
parts for one model of a car. The parts are manufactured by different specialized companies and brought to the
assemble line for assembly Just in Time (JIT) to avoid build-up of bottleneck. A good and reliable supplier must
deliver enough materials to be used per shift to the customer in time to reduce inventory. The supply of products from
one production center is demanded by say four companies where manufacturing tools are not the same and need to

Figure 8.  Down times caused by bottlenecks 
Urgent attention and collaboration in the development of materials with the suppliers is needed to ensure correct 
green materials are supplied to the factory.  Any pretreatment required is done to enhance the methods of processing 
to add value without hindrances.  
 
Kaizens to improve the methods must be done on each machine center to establish error proof methods. Selected 
methods must be improved, and standards set to ensure consistency. The wrong methods identified in the study was 
the bending of some parts along grain leading to fracture. The metal sheets blanks must be blanked in a way that any 
proceeding bending operation is across grain. The maximum losses due to change over times is 3% which need to be 
reduced to zero by using fixtures that use fast acting clamps instead of threaded fasteners. A 3% rejects rate is high 
and must be reduced to zero through continuous improvement in the 4Ms. 
 
6. Conclusions and Recommendations 
This section has conclusions and proposed recommendations for future use when applying the LM principles by 
academics and industry. This study showed that eliminating bottlenecks is critical to increase the throughput rate. 
Adopting LM improves the procurement of raw materials, personnel skills, housekeeping, equipment uptime, 
inventory control and provides a good health and safety environment for finished goods delivery to customers. A 
sustainable increase in productivity was driven by collaborating with all stakeholders. Good housekeeping is safe, 
fast and has no delays due to pileup. Trying to increase productivity on the back of employees posed costly safety 
problems hence the need to consult, involve and engage for any change in strategy to get their vital opinions. Sharing 
knowledge by providing training to collaborating companies and suppliers created a synergy for achieving the overall 
goals. Regular Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Gemba walks uncover hidden bottlenecks that were remedied by 
a change in technology, manufacturing equipment, materials, or techniques to provide the highest value gain. Line 
balancing using the available resources offsets the bottlenecks. Investing in intelligent technologies such the Jidoka 
to sense a looming bottleneck is recommended for small auto parts. Automation has high repeatability and produces 
identical parts that have the same quality in terms of shape, size and finish. Most automatic machine tools have sensors 
that can detect a looming error and show by an amber light. When the error is not corrected the sensor will shut down 
the machine to prevent any rejections. Similarly, automation can self-adjust the speed, federate when there is an 
anomaly. For each machine standard operating conditions are developed, set, and adhered to by all machine operators. 
The standards will reduce the non-value adding processes like motion, transport and overprocessing. This will 
increase the OEE, productivity, job satisfaction and financial gains.  
 
6.1 Recommendations for future use 
The study recommends frequent Gemba walk and VSM to identify the resources that cause a bottleneck. Management 
to make sufficient budgets for consultation, collaboration, manpower training, and subcontracting to optimize profits.

starts reduces waste. The use of green materials will have a safe working, positive environmental impact, and creation 
of employment opportunities in the downstream industries. The use of old machines as buffers will offset bottlenecks 
and reduce downtime. Education and training of the workers and community on green machines, materials, manpower 
and methods empowers the community with green waste disposal, job creation and economic development.

Abstract 
Advanced companies have promptly incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain functionalities into 
their service networks, significantly transforming the way their specific sectors see the execution of services. 
There have been a few studies on the use and combination of AI and blockchain, this study attempts to 
investigate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Intelligence (HI) are integrated in the banking sector 
under Industry 5.0. The study used a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative 
investigation of ten leading financial institutions in various nations to determine how often AI and HI are used. 
Information for this study was obtained from publically available sources, company records, and primary 
surveys. PLS-SEM was utilised for the primary data analysis in this study, which focused on how AI-HI 
collaboration affects customer support and personnel well-being. According to the study, AI-HI collaboration 
greatly improves employees well-being but has no effect on customer satisfaction while considering moderating 
factors like task difficulty. Although not considerably, AI explainability improves results, highlighting the need 
for more openness and knowledge.  The study's concentration on big financial institutions, which might not be 
typical of the industry as a whole, poses limitations. Future studies must to take into account a bigger sample 
size, as well as new markets and smaller businesses. The research findings hold great significance for 
policymakers and business leaders who seek to enhance human-AI collaboration and guarantee ethical and 
transparent AI implementation in the financial services sector.

1. Introduction
The fourth industrial revolution, often known as Industry 4.0, is revolutionising industries all around the world. 
It is distinguished by the emergence of digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data, the Internet 
of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. These technologies facilitate the next phase of automation, connectivity, 
and intelligence in manufacturing processes. The financial industry is not exempted to these transformational 
pressures. In fact, Industry 4.0 has the potential to profoundly disrupt and transform financial institutions' 
operations (Lee, et al. 2018). Businesses have been urged to embrace Industry 4.0 technologies in order to grow 
their clientele and profits over the past decade (Naeem & Di Maria, 2022). 
While technology is portrayed as a method of increasing efficiency and productivity in order to improve 
competitiveness in the global market, the notion of Operator 4.0 emphasises the use of such technology to 
achieve a specific level of human-centricity. Operators 4.0 are those who will be aided by technology that

Figure 4. Slope Analysis 
 
Slope analysis in Graph 1 shows how Task Complexity and AI-HI Collaboration interact to affect Customer 
Satisfaction. The graphic would demonstrate that the beneficial impact of AI-HI Collaboration on Customer 
Satisfaction decreases with increasing Task Complexity, in line with the strong negative interaction term seen in 
the path coefficients. This implies that whereas AI-HI collaboration typically improves customer happiness, it 
becomes less successful when dealing with increasingly complicated task circumstances. 
 
4.1 Findings  
The findings of the research indicate a complex interaction between HI and AI in the context of Industry 5.0 in 
the financial industry. Although there is a positive association between customer happiness and the collaboration 
of artificial intelligence and human intelligence, this effect is not statistically significant, suggesting that other 
factors—like task difficulty and service quality—may have a greater influence on customer views. On the other 
hand, there is a noteworthy correlation between employee well-being and AI-HI collaboration, indicating that 
when AI is properly integrated with human efforts, it can successfully decrease workload and improve job 
satisfaction. This demonstrates how AI may benefit employees and enhance their well-being within the 
company.  
 
The study also reveals that, however these impacts are not statistically significant, the degree of explainability in 
AI systems significantly influences staff and consumer well-being. This implies that even though it is desired, 
openness in AI judgements may not have as much of an influence unless customers and staff completely 
comprehend and have faith in the AI systems. A noteworthy moderator that also comes into play is job 
complexity, especially when it comes to the connection between customer happiness and AI-HI collaboration. 
The favourable impacts of AI-HI collaboration on customer satisfaction decrease with work complexity, 
suggesting that more complicated tasks may call for more human judgement and involvement—something AI 
cannot supply alone. 
 
4.2 Limitation of the Study 
• 
Even if concentrating on ten elite institutions yields insightful information, it may not be entirely 
representative of the financial sector as a whole, especially when it comes to smaller firms or those 
operating in emerging nations. For improved generalizability, larger sample sizes may be investigated 
in future studies. 
• 
The research sample size was selected with fewer individuals who were distributed unevenly 
geographically; hence it may not yield reliable results. 
 
5. Conclusion   
The study advances knowledge on how the financial sector's main outcomes under Industry 5.0 are impacted by 
the collaboration of AI and HI. The results indicate that although AI can improve employee and customer 
happiness, its usefulness varies depending on the environment, especially when it comes to task complexity and 
the degree of explainability offered. It is critical for organisations looking to get the most out of AI to strike a 
458","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
balance between AI's capabilities and human judgement, particularly in complicated and high-stakes situations. 
The benefits of working together on AI-HI projects can also be increased by enhancing AI explainability and 
encouraging staff and customer comprehension of AI operations. To build on these findings, future studies 
should investigate these dynamics in various settings and with bigger, more varied populations.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to develop accurate mathematical models to investigate Boron diffusion in textured solar cells. 
Most of the papers found in literature have investigated Boron diffusion in planar solar cells.  However, texturing 
affects significantly both Boron diffusion processes and cell performance. Since texturing creates extra defects in the 
valleys of texturing pyramids, increases the surface area of the cell, and causes significant residual stresses.  We are 
proposing and selecting from literature suitable diffusion models that provide Boron diffusion profiles for textured 
cells that are in good agreement with experiments found in literature.  Numerical results showing the effects of 
texturing geometry on Boron diffusion for a sample solar cell will be presented, analyzed, and validated. We found 
that both the magnitude of the Boron diffusion concentrations and the Boron diffusion depths are decreasing with 
increasing texturing angles. Therefore, the optical efficiency will be significantly affected.

1. Introduction
The aim of this paper is to develop accurate mathematical models for the ion implantation and ion diffusion in textured 
silicon solar cells (Elizabeth et al. 2021), (Johannes et al. 2021, Jurgen at al. 2019), (Netsor at al. 2010), (Song and 
Meixiang 2018). Firstly, we are including the effects of the texturing geometry on ion implantation by improving the 
equations of the standard Pearson IV model.  The existing standard Pearson IV model does not include the effects of 
texturing on ion implantation. The standard Pearson IV model has been widely used by semiconductor community to 
investigate ion implantation in planar solar cells (Elizabeth et al. 2021), (Johannes et al. 2021),  (Jurgen at al. 2019), 
(Hanane et al., 2016), (Fa-Jun et al., 2014). This model needs to be improved for textured solar cells (El Boukili 2019). 
Secondly, we are including the effects of texturing geometry in the equations of ion diffusion in textured solar cells 
through Poisson’s equation (El Boukili 2019). This will significantly improve the accuracy of the ion diffusion profiles 
in textured solar cells. In recent literature, researchers are using the same mathematical models for planar and textured 
solar cells (Hanane et al., 2016), (Fa-Jun et al., 2014).  This is not accurate. The experimental results found in literature 
for ion diffusion are proving that many extra effects are caused by texturing.  These effects are not present in planar 
solar cells. First, texturing will increase the planar surfaces of the solar cell and introduce extra defects at the valleys 
and at the tips of the texturing pyramids. This will reduce the ion implanted dose and then the diffusion profiles of the 
dopants as Boron.  Our motivation in this research is an attempt to add little improvement to the existing mathematical 
models used in literature for ion implantation and diffusion in textured solar cells. The existing models are not 
accurately considering the effects texturing.  This research is needed by the community of solar cells to help predict 
accurately the performance of the recent textured solar cells and reduce their cost to market. The problem we are trying 
to solve in this research is how to model mathematically the effects of the texturing geometry on ion implantation and 
diffusion. This is not a piece of cake. and it is still a big challenge. As far as we know, no one is working on these 
issues.

6. Conclusion 
The findings in this research paper are explaining some of the effects of texturing angles on the Boron diffusion 
profiles in textured solar cells. The simulation results are confirming that the magnitude of the Boron diffusion profiles 
is decreasing with increasing texturing angles. The diffusion depths are also decreasing with increasing texturing 
angles.  Therefore, the optical efficiency will be significantly impacted.   The use of Pearson IV model in implantation 
and diffusion equations provided Boron diffusion profiles that are in good agreement with experimental profiles found 
in recent literature.  We will study the impact  of texturing with random pyramids  on the diffusion of Boron in double-
sided textured solar cells in our future work.

Abstract 
The 4th Industrial revolution and artificial intelligence has become pivotal in the manufacturing supply value chains, 
in terms of enhancing productivity, efficiency and customer service management. Robotics are gradually facilitating 
the production processes at an exceeding rate, whereby the human skill is either being replaced or enhanced in an 
interwoven manner as to assist the industrial processes. For sustainable industrialization to be realized it is a key 
essential for the advancement in technology to be complemented with the advancement in the human skill and there 
be closer interaction between the human skill and the applied technologies. In robots; as this interwoven approach, 
systematically advances production processes in terms of achieving economies of scale, higher efficiencies, 
competitiveness, total quality management , customer relations management and at a more global level in the industrial 
value chain it efficiently addresses the economics of social cost benefit analysis resulting from manufacturing and 
production processes, such as the impact on economic indicators such as labour absorbing industrialisation, skills 
development in manufacturing , purchasing manager index and finally an evidence based localization informed by 
ratio of exports and imports. In light of all the highlighted elements, the paper will in detail discuss the fourth IR and 
artificial intelligence in the industrial manufacturing value chains and the impact in terms of realizing the economics 
of social cost benefit analysis. (The Fourth Industrial Revolution and artificial intelligence have become indispensable 
in modern manufacturing supply value chains, significantly enhancing productivity, efficiency, and customer service 
management. Robotics are increasingly revolutionizing production processes, either replacing or augmenting human 
skills, thereby intricately intertwining with industrial operations. Sustainable industrialization necessitates not only 
technological advancement but also the concurrent development of human skills, fostering closer interaction between 
human capabilities and applied technologies. This integrated approach in robotics systematically advances production 
processes, achieving economies of scale, heightened efficiencies, competitiveness, and total quality management. At 
a global level within industrial value chains, it effectively addresses the economics of social cost-benefit analysis 
stemming from manufacturing and production processes. Key economic indicators such as labor absorption in 
industrialization, skills development in manufacturing, purchasing manager indices, and evidence-based localization 
influenced by trade balances are profoundly impacted. In light of these factors, this paper aims to comprehensively 
explore the role of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and artificial intelligence in industrial manufacturing value chains, 
particularly in realizing the economics of social cost-benefit analysis.

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, while the manufacturing industry has made significant strides in adopting digitization and artificial 
intelligence (AI), substantial challenges continue to impede their widespread integration and realization of full 
potential. AI holds the promise of reshaping competitiveness, agility, and sustainability within manufacturing, yet its 
deployment remains uneven across different industry sectors. This disparity is exacerbated by high initial costs, 
technological readiness gaps, and organizational resistance to change, all of which hinder transformative outcomes. 
Moreover, leveraging AI effectively to enhance product design, cost optimization, and quality management 
necessitates overcoming logistical complexities and adapting swiftly to evolving market demands. Issues such as 
insufficient infrastructure support for AI deployment, cybersecurity risks, and ethical considerations further 
complicate implementation efforts. 
 
Additionally, disparities in digital literacy across workforce segments and the imperative for continuous upskilling 
present critical challenges as manufacturing enterprises endeavor to harness AI for improved inventory management, 
supply chain efficiency, and customer responsiveness. 
 
Addressing these multifaceted challenges is crucial to unlocking the full potential of digitization and AI in driving 
sustainable growth, innovation, and global competitiveness across the manufacturing sector. This study has explored 
these challenges, analyzed current practices, identified barriers, and proposed strategic recommendations to facilitate 
a conducive environment for AI-driven advancements in manufacturing.

Abstract 
The goal of this project is to control a robotic arm in real-time through computer vision. Live video feed is used as 
input for this project. The hand gesture is discovered in the video feed using Google's MediaPipe framework and sent 
to the Arduino Uno through serial communication. The servos of the robotic arms are programmed by an Arduino 
Uno in turn. This challenge required the use of MediaPipe and OpenCV. The code was implemented in Python. The 
present investigation investigates the possibilities for intuitive control of machines or robots through human-machine 
interaction. This project can address SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure).
