Abstract 
Background music is one of inseparable and indispensable elements in video games. It is considered as one of the 
aesthetic elements that contributes to players’ enjoyment. This research is a part of ludo-musicology studies, which 
aims to investigate the effect of background music on the players’ immersion, including sense of spatial presence, and 
emotions during the game. Participants were assigned in groups to play the same virtual social game experience 
(VSGE) two times – one time with their headphones on, and the second time without any headphones. Every game 
lasted for 15-20 minutes. After the experiments, participants were asked to fill questionnaires to compare both 
experiences regarding the immersion, spatial presence, and the emotions they feel during the game using Likert scales. 
To validate the participants’ answers, we held a forum group discussion (FGD) consisting of 5 participants to gain 
deeper understanding regarding the causes that support the players’ immersion.

Abstract 
The paper proposes an optimization procedure for the design of a three-phase 
Interior Permanent Magnet synchronous motor. The multi-objective function 
maximizes the average torque, and the constraints are the efficiency and torque 
ripple. Various metamodels were generated for each of the multi-objective 
functions and constraints, and the metamodels with the best prediction 
performance were selected. By applying a multi-objective genetic algorithm, 
several optimal solutions were compared to those of the initial model. The 
proposed multi-objective optimization method can guide the design of IPMs for 
electric vehicles with high reliability and strong demagnetization characteristics.. 
This program allows estimating the back emf, flux density, electromagnetic 
torque, and ripple torque by analytical MATLAB program coupling to finite 
element magnetic method (FEMM) and GA optimization. Finally, rotor 
lamination was stamped and assembled in the motor for the back EMF test and 
no load-test. The design optimization is based on a new algorithm belonging to 
the class of Controlled Random Search algorithms. This optimization technique 
has been able to find a very efficient design pointing out its effectiveness besides 
its versatility and robustness

1. INTRODUCTION 
This paper will describe the design optimization of a three-phase interior PM synchronous motor. 
The aim is to investigate the possibilities to maintain constant power in the field-weakening region 
minimizing the active volume and maximizing the power output. The design optimization of the IPM 
motor is based on a new algorithm belonging to the class of Controlled Random Search (CRS) 
algorithms that derive from the algorithm proposed in Hong, G 2018, Shuangshuang 2020. Multi-
objective optimization of maximum average torque and outpower is employed to design a 5 kW- IPM 
synchronous motor. Several parameters of stator diameter, slot depth, air gap, and magnet angle are 
variables. Mid-drive motors are known for higher performance and torque when compared to a 
similarly powered traditional hub motor in Edhah, S.O. 2018 because they have higher torque and 
power density. This design proposal will be applied for the middle drive motor for a sports scooter 
developed by Selex company in Vietnam. The Express delivery motorcycle for Viettel post drivers 
has some special requirements such as high load capacity and long distance for one charge.

The purpose of rotor designing and building the prototype has been to investigate if the physical 
properties of the motor predicted in the design stage can be actually achieved in practice regardless 
of any design limitations dictated by the available magnet materials or the requirements for having 
specific motor dimensions. 
5. CONCLUSION 
      An effective analytical model is developed and verified with a prototype. To optimize the design 
process of the motor in a very short period of time and also without any need of FEM an intelligent 
optimization algorithm is fully implemented and described. The result of optimization shows the 
efficiency of the entire approach. The analytical model and the optimization program are both 
implemented using MATLAB which makes it easier to use. To validate if the suggested motor truly 
meets the requirements and boundaries, results are verified using FEM which is also controlled via 
MATLAB and will be initiated automatically after optimization. The entire package is a very 
powerful tool for the optimized design of a permanent magnet synchronous motor.

Abstract 
LS-PMA-SynRMs can operate with a direct start for net voltage or drive-by power converter 
with torque control methods. Especially, the LS-PMA-SynRM has a higher irreversible 
demagnetization level than IPM because it has a less permanent magnet in rotor slots in 
comparison with IPM. This paper will develop different rotor designs and modeling of a line-
start permanent magnet assistance synchronous reluctance motor (LS-PMA-SynRM) with 
permanent magnets arrangement in V type considering skew slot and demagnetization effect. 
The short circuit current is analyzed and compared by finite element analysis FEA in no skewed 
and skew slots. The demagnetization performance of LS-PMA-SynRM is analyzed considering 
V magnet shape and skewed angle. The proposed model of LS-PMA-SynRM has been 
improved efficiency, torque, and output power. Finally, the LS-PMA-SynRM with 3V layered 
magnets rotor is prototyped to verify by full efficiency map to evaluate EVs application.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent studies show that line start permanent magnet assistance synchronous reluctance (LS-PMA-SynRMs)
present promising technologies because of their advantages such as simple structure and minimized the amount of
permanent magnet Hyunwoo Kim 2020 and Cheng Gong 2021. Therefore, new types of motor are being studied
to improve the efficiency of Line Start Permanent Magnet Assistance Synchronous Reluctance Motors (LS-PMA-
SynRMs). When LS-PMA-SynRMs are operated at a synchronous speed, the secondary copper loss is eliminated
so the efficiency can improve significantly. To save energy, use less rare-earth materials, and decrease the cost in
terms of material and manufacturing processes LS-PMA-SynRMs are a good choice. A comprehensive study on
line starts permanent magnet assistance synchronous reluctance (LS-PMA-SynRMs) is developed for direct start
or torque control methods by power inverters. This study shows that the LS-PMA-SynRM has less rare-earth
materials, low cost, comparable constant-power speed range, maximum torque per ampere, and efficiency of LS-
PMa-SynRMs. In particular, LS-PMA-SynRMs have an interesting choice in electric traction and more-electrical
aircraft applications because they have a special flux barrier and magnet arrangement to improve constant torque
in wide range speed and less risk of irreversible demagnetization in short circuit and overheat temperature.

.Conclusions 
This paper has analyzed and compared the demagnetization of three multi-layered LS_PMA-SYNRM machines 
for industrial and traction applications. The 3V shape with 5 slice skewing has the lowest volume of magnets and 
high torque and power density. Under short circuit conditions, the 3V shape skewing slot-LS-PMA-SYNRM 
machine has a lower demagnetization level in comparison with the straight design. To verify the proposed design, 
back EMF and demagnetization performances have been evaluated with limit temperature rises. The back EMF 
has been analyzed based on the FEA modeling to verify maximum speed.  The thermal simulation was 
implemented to validate overheat capacity.

Abstract 
This paper presents the design optimization procedure of three-phase interior permanent magnet 
(IPM) synchronous motors with minimum weight, maximum power output for a wide constant-
power range. The particular rotor geometry of the IPM motor with several variables and constraints 
has been implemented by the DoE method. This study is to combine an accurate ﬁnite-element 
analysis with a multiobjective optimization procedure using a new algorithm belonging to the class 
of controlled random search algorithms. The optimization procedure has been employed to design 
two IPM motors for EVs. A prototype has been realized and tested. Torque’s current characteristic 
result comparison between simulated and measured performances shows the reliability of the 
simulation results of the proposed procedure. The proposal motor design is based on both analytical 
models and special software to determine the magnetic sizes and geometry parameters of stator 
and rotor. The experimental test and analytical results have been used to evaluate silicon steel 
material for designs. To maximize efficiency performance, an optimal algorithm program built-in 
Matlab and FEM has been written and shown in PC interfaces

Introduction 
The IPM motors built with magnets placed inside the rotor body are attracting great attention in several variable-
speed applications, such as electric vehicles and industrial and domestic appliances, where the most challenging 
requirement are high efﬁciency, high torque density, good overload capability, and extended speed range. The 
performance of IPM machines is significantly affected by the magnet rotor topologies in Chen Peng 2021, 
Wenliang Zhao 2015. Thus, several Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Design Trend are developing 
different topology rotor designs such as V-shaped from manufacturer Tesla; double V magnet shape from 
manufacturer China, delta shape from manufacturer AVL, hybrid delta shape based on the V shape from both 
manufacturer Tesla and manufacturer Nissan; hybrid double V shape from both manufacturer T and manufacturer 
V. Those design of rotor shape have aimed to maximize efﬁciency, torque density, overload load capability Chen
Peng 2021, Wenliang Zhao 2015, Yang, Y 2017. This study will focus on multi geometry parameters of the rotor
design concept with VV magnet arrangement. This study will improve design average torque current characteristic
by hybrid rotor shape design and step skewing magnet segment. In this paper, the Torque and power vs current of
the IPM step-skew magnet rotor are manufactured to verify by experiment methods.
Electromagnetic Design 
The objective of improving the ﬂux-weakening capability of IPM motors received wide interest in literature in 
Chen Peng 2021. The design was formulated as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem consisting of 
maximizing the machine efﬁciency while minimizing its weight in [6]. The method for maximizing performance 
by modifying the PM quantity was analyzed in Liu, X 2017. The rotor design optimization of IPM motors for wide 
speed ranges using an FEA-based multiobjective genetic algorithm with three-goal functions (motor torque, torque 
ripple, and ﬂux-weakening capability were present in Wang, A.; 2011. This paper proposes a design optimization 
and evaluation procedure of three-phase IPM synchronous motors suitable for wide constant-power region 
operation to minimize the motor weight and maximize the output power. An analytical program was developed to 
estimate torque, efficiency value by MATLAB coupling to FEMM into one program as figure 2. The analytical

The corner point is located between measurement points (4000 and 5000 rpm motor speed in driving mode), and 
therefore can be just estimated by calculations ▪ Corner speed not significantly changing, when DC voltage is 
varied between 350V and 450V. Output power at high speeds increases intensively between 350VDC and 400VDC. 
Some high-speed points at 350VDC and 400 VDC in regenerative braking mode were not measured due to testbed 
issues. Power curves in Q1 and Q4 beyond base speed are not symmetric, mainly due to transmission losses.  
150kW peak output power target was not reached 
Conclusions 
This paper has analyzed and compared the DoE optimization of the step-skew IPM motor for EV applications. To 
verify the proposed design, The Optimized VV variants of a 3-phase 48-slot and 8-pole I PM machine is 
manufactured and tested. The torque, power, and efficiency under peak torque performance and short overload 
have been measured at a maximum speed of 16000 rpm. A significant contribution of this study is to figure out 
DoE result and commends of, max torque, and testing procedures of IPM motor which is useful for developing 
IPM motor for EV applications. The optimized results and tested performance are good agreement.

Abstract 
Efficiency is affected by the geometry parameter and rotor slot number selection therefore a 
Genetic Algorithm based optimal design of a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor is applied 
to improve the efficiency of IM 2.2kW-4P from efficiency class IE2 to IE 4 motor design. An 
analytical calculation will investigate power, losses, and efficiency with different geometrical 
parameters of stator/rotor. Different constraints and different variables are imposed to achieve the 
best design within a specified range of variables. A genetic algorithm is used to achieve optimal 
design of the Squirrel Cage Induction motor-SCIM 2.2kW-4P with 36 stator slots/ 28,32, 40, and 
44 rotor bars are verified under starting and constant speed. Their electromagnetic characteristics, 
such as electromagnetic torque, stator current, and magnetic flux density are compared in between 
two configurations. The paper contributes that the proper geometry parameters have a strong 
impact on the induction motor efficiency and the best design is applied for a 2.2kW induction 
motor with fixed stator and rotor diameters. The results obtained after running the optimization 
technique give visible improvements in efficiency as well as cost. To obtain the best design 
efficiency and cost of material is obtained using multi-objective Genetic Algorithm.

Introduction 
Energy Demand is increasing day by day and Power generation is also pressurized to maintain Continuity and Generate 
a huge amount of power to match demand. So, the increasing imbalance between generation and demand made us 
focus on energy Conservation. All the Transmission lines are operating at full load. The goal of this paper is to give a 
contribution to the design optimization of a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor using two different objective 
functions: namely ""Efficiency"" and ""active Material Weight"". A GA method for designing of three-phase squirrel cage 
induction motor have developed in Rakeshkumar Chaudharyl 2016, M. Çunka and R. Akkaya 2006, J. Haataja and J. 
Pyrhones 2000 K. B. Mohammad 2004. In this study, Genetic Algorithm coupling to MATLAB for calculation and 
FEM-CAD for geometry drawing is used as an optimization method the SCIM 2.2kW-4P with variables of stator/rotor 
diameter, the depth and width of the stator/rotor slots, and the air-gap length. The efficiency and losses of some 
simulated induction motors with different rotor slot numbers have been shown and discussed. Three of the rotor slot 
selected numbers are 28, 32, and 40 with skewing rotor slots.

function cost decreases but efficiency also decreases. To choose the best value of efficiency or cost to compromise in 
another value of objective function. To solve this problem; a method of ""dual optimization"" can be implemented with 
two objective functions together. An NSGA-II programs in MATLAB in Deb K 2002 and 2006 is used for dual 
optimization with efficiency and active material cost as the objective function 
Figure 4 MATLAB results for Efficiency and Cost as Objective Function 
Figure 4 shows the relation between two objective functions this is obtained using NSGA-II Program in MATLAB. 
The numbers of generations selected are 200 and 50 populations for each generation. The above graph shows that with 
the higher efficiency; the cost of the motor is higher, and it decreases with a decreased efficiency. The proposed design 
with 90.6% (higher IE4) can be designed as per requirement from results obtained using the NSGA-II program. 
Conclusions 
 This paper has analyzed and compared the electromagnetic performance of three induction motors for industrial 
applications. The 44-rotor bar has the lowest iron loss. To verify the proposed design, a detailed design of a 3-phase 
36-slot and 4-pole IM is assembled and verified torque, power, and efficiency performances. The back EMF
waveforms have been analyzed based on the FEA modeling.  The thermal simulation was implemented to validate
overheat capacity. The main aim of the present investigation is to optimize the induction motor efficiency using a
genetic algorithm tool. It optimizes geometric parameters such as inner stator diameter, geometric ratio, stator slot
height, back iron thickness, air-gap length and stator tooth flux density, rotor tooth flux density to minimize the
machine weight and maximize its efficiency. The GA optimized approach has been successfully applied on a typical
2.2 kW, 4 poles induction machine. It can be drawn from the optimized results, that the choice of the magnetic metal
sheets has in important impact on machine efficiency. The achieved results with three material sheet types of this
investigation have clearly demonstrated that the machine efficiency can be improved by this optimization procedure.
Such achievement can be considered of great interest since it results in a paramount of energy saving and consequently
an important reduction on the energy running cost.

Abstract 
Additive manufacturing (Wiki on 3-D printing) is an emerging manufacturing technology that needs to be perfected 
before it can start delivering. It is a game changer. It is planned that the AM printer will be kept in the customer’s 
premises and will receive instructions head office over IoT (Wiki on IoT) for printing layer by layer and the job will 
be done before the eyes of the customer. It has been proposed in the literature that for optimal performance of AM 
printing Taguchi Methods (Wiki on Taguchi Methods) can be used for parameter optimization. If AM is deployed for 
customization, then experiments (and generating required sampling points) is likely to be costly. We touch on a few 
AM-related organizational issues such as strategy (cost leader CL and differentiator DIFF). Finally, we give a few 
heuristics for scheduling jobs on AM machines.

Abstract 
In this paper we start with a brief literature review on HM, FM and BM. Then we relate these among themselves 
to argue that FM = HM + BM. We map these advanced manufacturing technologies to the strategy of the 
organization. Later we give several interesting hypotheses and conjectures. Finally we draw a table that relates 
different types of flexibilities of HM, FM and BM.

1. Introduction and Literature Review
For advanced information systems in Supply Chain and Organizations refer to Xu (2011). Agent is a software 
entity that can autonomously with its environment. Management practice has gone up to level (as enterprise social 
media & social media) where many routine jobs can be automated. And typically in the context of AMT as above, 
functional agents (such as production, marketing, HR, finance) that have routine jobs that can be automated. And 
agents (functional agents) can use predictive analytics. As Lawrence and Lorsh have noted, organizations need to 
do differentiation (along functional lines) and must do integration (and this in the context of AMTs means there 
has to be an integrating agent that is also known as goal determination agent). And integration still is an art that 
has to be performed by chief executive, the analytics is diagnostic (as uncertainty is high, the goal determination 
is increasingly difficult). Typically in Holonic manufacturing integrating agent is highly required, and in Fractal 
manufacturing this integrating module is easier (as it uses the concept of PWP & in each PWP there is high 
centralization). In FM resources are redeployed as market conditions change. And this has following implications. 
Extreme Programming is used for software development for Holonic/Fractal manufacturing (that are exposed to 
higher levels of uncertainty (here priority of objectives change very often) as it assumes the strategy of analyser), 
that have reconfigurable properties; and this is required as the system tends to mimic goal determination agent. 
Here there will be loose coupling (and here use of service oriented architecture is recommended). In case 
uncertainly is a bit less and one may go for SCRUM programming. 
Management control systems tends to be increasingly diagnostic for those elements that are-automated in the form 
of AGENTS; and lesser portions of operations/strategy making is INTERACTIVE. 
Bionic manufacturing tends to mimic the human system (that is composed of nerves and brain); here nerves 
denotes centralized decision making. Here software development process is FDD (feature driven development); 
and here there is tight coupling. In BM goal determination is much easier. As all manufacturing resources are 
reconfigurable, BM, HM and FM can co-exist in a factory. However in general learning curve may not be there 
as there is frequent reconfiguration as market conditions change. A clarification: in Holonic manufacturing there 
is goal determination/integrating agent; and in FM there is PWP and goal determination is within a plant and in

2.9 Can Holonic/ Fractal/ Bionic Manufacturing Replace MRP-2 and JIT? Few Observations 
Conjecture 4: Given the large number of population that belongs to ‘have not’ category, conventional mfg JIT & 
MRP2 will continue to be used. This is from economic point of view. 
 
More over as resources are frequently re deployed, the Bionic Mfg (that is top down) will not be able to have the 
Learning Curve Effect that conventional JIT is able to have. 
 
Conjecture 5: Holonic/ Fractal/ Bionic Manufacturing as yet will not be able to replace MRP-2, as these AMTs 
(Holonic/ Fractal/ Bionic Manufacturing) are not geared for complex product structures such as Naval Ships and 
Aero planes. Also these AMTs are ill prepared to handle the layout by fixed position that is used frequently in 
manufacturing of Naval Ships and Aero Planes.  
 
2.10 Evaluating Holonic and Fractal Mfg (HM/FM)  
Evaluating Holonic Mfg would be similar to evaluating a shop where MRP is being used. Here lot sizes are few, 
and product variety is very high; and hence the criteria would be: set up cost (generally low in HM), Inventory 
carrying cost, machine utilization, shortages, machine downtime, capacity utilization and delays (tardiness of 
jobs).  
 
Whereas, in FM, criteria are different for each of the fractals, that are dedicated to a specific product/segment.  
 
In the context where a product has sufficiently high volumes and it can afford a separate plant (known as PWP: 
done in fractal mfg) then such reconfigurable mfg systems, have higher tolerance to change; whereas, in HM 
integration levels are high, and as a consequence here there is lower tolerance to change (relatively).

3. Conclusion 
In this paper we gave a state of art literature review on bionic, holonic and fractal manufacturing. We related these 
to each other so that we get a better understanding of these manufacturing systems. We related these concepts to 
the strategy of the organizations. Several interesting propositions, conjectures and statements are given. This is a 
useful contribution we make in this paper. Most of the novel ideas presented in this paper are taken from four 
books of working papers by Sharma (2019-2021).

Abstract 
Fire outbreak, traffic accidents, rescue operations etc. are fairly common in a human settlement all over the globe. 
The government funded fire stations are responsible to control such situations at the earliest possible. The response 
time and road route must be minimized to ensure that the adversity is taken under control quickly. To set up such 
a fire station at an optimal location we also need to consider the budget involved and the value of the locality 
which it would serve. This paper presents three models i.e. establishment cost, optimal service level and hybrid 
model of locating a fire station in a city by extending the mixed linear programming formulation using binary 
genetic algorithm. The proposed models are tested for problem sizes of n = 30 and 60 using GAMS 23.5 and 
comparisons of optimum results are reported. Hybrid model performs best that help to decision-makers to enhance 
their decision capabilities.

1. Introduction
We all have seen bright red coloured fire trucks rushing on the roads. Fire-fighters are summoned whenever there 
is a fire outbreak, traffic accidents, rescue operation or any kind of disaster and emergency situations. Time is the 
biggest challenge for them as each second could be fatal for human lives and could also bring huge loss to property 
as well. Presently, most of the fire department operations are concentrated mostly in the urban areas. Fire trucks 
take the shortest distance to the place of incident along with ambulance to control the adversity and provide 
medical assistance to the victims. To improve the rescue operations, the most important factor that comes into the 
play is locating the fire stations at the optimal places in a city. Since, fire department is run by the government 
and public funds are used for the setup, the fire department need to work according to the budget provided by the 
government. As this is an emergency requirement for the society, fire department can not compromise on their 
quality of service and the requirements which are stated in the regulations. Thus, numerous constraints and 
variables are taken into account before deciding the optimal location of a fire station. For example, if a locality 
has a high value; meaning the locality comprises of industries, large human settlements, expensive properties etc. 
then a fire station should be set up at a near distance from it. 
This type of facility location problem comes under the umbrella of hard to solve problems. Hence, computer is 
required to solve these kinds of problems for the time being. The advancement of computer technology has 
brought convenience to the solution approaches. General Algebraic Modelling Systems (GAMS) is a 
mathematical modelling programming environment which is useful for solving complex mathematical problems 
easily. The problem is fed and coded in the GAMS IDE. Various linear models are made and ran in the software  
by importing data tables from MS Excel. The outputs are recorded and put up for tests and analysis. The best 
model is then selected on the basis of the results produced.

and also the cost is minimized that will help in setting the budget for the fire department accordingly. This is a 
result we obtained under ideal conditions; thus, it is subject to change when applied practically in the real-life 
depending on a lot of other quantitative and qualitative aspects which are not taken into consideration in our 
analysis.

Abstract 
This paper develops and analyzes a model for hospital location and capacity allocation.Thefocus is on an 
urban/developing area. The first model is the convectional model and the secondis an improved model with better 
constraints, previous work in the planning of hospitals and/orhealth centers in a region has been done with less 
constraints hence is easily implementableand has less administrative load but costs may be higher.This work focuses 
on developing andanalyzing a model for hospital location and capacity allocation while optimizing a number 
ofobjectives, e.g. minimizing cost of establishment and maximizing coverage of patients.The model 1 is easily 
implementable and has less administrative load hence costs may behigher, prescribed Model has more variables 
(hence more CPU time) and requires more administrative load for implementation but costs are probably 
lesser.Hence cost can be reducedconsiderably if we can trade with speed of solution.

1.Introduction
Hospitals or health care centers play a pivotal role in mitigating serious injuries that occur in a region and are a 
critical resource because of limited space and large construction investment and operating costs. They are shared 
among different types of patients with different access targets determined by their location, previous work in the 
planning of hospitals and/or health centers in a region hasbeen done with less constraints hence is easily 
implementable and has less administrative load but costs may be higher. Determining the precise location of 
healthcare services is essential because ofthe vital importance of these centers. In most cities, lack of proper space 
allocation and optimal location of the city's services with facilities, especially health services (hospitals and clinics), 
have led to an ascending increase in urban and citizen problems. This work focuses on developing and analyzing a 
model for hospital location and capacity allocation while optimizing a number of objectives, e.g. minimizing cost of 
establishment and maximizing coverage of patients. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2

Abstract 
 
Return and risk are two important attribute of any portfolio. On likes to max return by keeping at a given level 
or min risk by keeping return at a min level. Or one takes a composite of return and take negative of risk 
aversion factor multiplied by risk of a portfolio and max it subject to wealth constraint (this is the traditional 
mean-variance approach: see Subramanyam and Patel () and Shama and Pankaj ()). In this model the risk 
aversion factor remains the same whatever be the wealth available with the decision maker. It is well known that 
as wealth of an individual increases his risk proneness also increases. This aspect is considered in the model that 
is presented in this paper by assuming that as wealth band changes, then also changes the risk aversion factor. 
Now we give two models of such situation that considers the mean-variance approach to portfolio selection, and 
conduct numerical investigation to see which of the two models do better.

Abstract 
The global engineering workforce needs to have the ability to analyze ‘big’ data sets critically to understand how and 
when to apply data in various settings and also understand how data can be interpreted to reveal a deeper contextual 
understanding about risks involved from multiple perspectives. In order to be able to provide aspiring engineering 
professionals with the complex skills necessary to use a variety of data sets, undergraduates require exposure to 
fundamental skills, challenging problems based in real world settings, and exposure to undergraduates with different 
disciplinary perspectives. This paper will provide an overview of a university-wide effort to facilitate the development 
of the fundamental data analytics skills through transdisciplinary workplace relevant learning opportunities that bring 
engineering students together with the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and arts. Discussion will focus on the 
transdisciplinary faculty design effort and how industry professionals were involved in the construction, 
implementation, and support of the effort. Discussion will focus on the curriculum that is offered through a Data and 
Decisions Minor as well as the opportunity to earn a Digital Tech Credential that is co-approved by a consortium of 
employers and institutions in the Capital Collaborative of Leaders in Academia and Business (CoLAB). The 
information presented in this paper provides an opportunity for universities and industry professionals to consider 
creative partnerships that can better prepare future leaders of the engineering workforce. Engineering educators and 
future employers can use the findings presented in this paper to consider how to implement similar approaches at other 
institutions.

1. Introduction
The global engineering workforce needs to have the ability to analyze ‘big’ data sets critically to understand how and 
when to apply data in various settings and also understand how data can be interpreted to reveal a deeper contextual 
understanding about risks involved from multiple perspectives. Recent studies have cited the need to have a workforce 
that has strong technical data analytics skills coupled with the ability to communicate findings. Technical knowledge 
combined with skills such as effective written and oral communication allows individuals to work across an 
organization to make recommendations based on results derived from analyses (Canada’s Big Data Consortium 2022). 
International reports underscore the need to have a workforce that is equipped with problem solving skills that allow 
them to think critically and analytically to address challenges (World Economic Forum  2020). These reports are 
coupled with trends that indicate the workforce will need to have higher order cognitive skills such as critical thinking, 
decision making, and complex information processing in order to be positioned to productively contribute to technical

continued economic growth and have highlighted the need to develop talent pathways that address needs in data 
analytics skills. Students that attain the Capital CoLAB Digital Generalist Credential through completion of the Data 
and Decisions Minor are of great interest to industries in the Partnership that are recruiting for jobs that require data 
skills. 
4. Conclusion
To date, the curricular experiences that are part of the Data and Decisions effort have provided unique opportunities 
for currently enrolled engineering students as well as students more generally to develop data analytic skills as well 
as decision making skills. In addition, the curriculum advances communication skills and team-based collaboration 
skills which are highly sought after in the workforce. Students demonstrate their mastery of these important skills 
with the attainment of a minor and potentially with an additional workforce relevant certificate. Future efforts plan 
to examine more closely the specific learning outcomes of the students and the long-term outcomes as students 
matriculate into full-time jobs.  
In conclusion, the efforts at Virginia Tech to facilitate interaction between faculty from different and departments to 
design curricular offerings in key thematic areas has produced a series of learning experiences that are unique and 
important for the future workforce. The holistic experience that includes multi-disciplinary team-based learning 
around real world data challenges is developing future engineers that will have the skills necessary to analyze, use, 
and evaluate data more effectively in the workplace.

Abstract 
This study aims at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions caused by drayage operations in port areas. Due to 
globalization and economic prosperity, freight movements have been increasing during the past decades. In port areas, 
a large portion of freight movements is made by trucks, causing significant negative impacts on traffic conditions, 
energy consumption, and GHG emissions. In the last decade, battery-powered vehicles have become an emerging 
topic, but only limited research attention has been paid to Battery Electric Heavy-Duty Trucks (BEHDT) in drainage 
operation. Addressing this understudied but promising field, we examine the research potential of using BEHDTs for 
daily container movements by proposing mathematical formulations, developing solution methodologies, and building 
simulation testbeds to evaluate transportation systems. Meanwhile, given that the most challenging issue for using 
BEHDTs is the battery life, we also consider the current status and future development trend of the battery industry. 
We will estimate the impacts of using BEHDTs from 2022 to 2050. The freight movement problem will be 
decomposed into two subproblems. The first is figuring out the minimum cost flow for demand satisfaction. The 
second solves a bin-packing problem based on a flow solution, which also considers the BEHDTs’ charging plans 
with range constraints. The numerical experiments are conducted with real-world data which can provide quantitative 
comparison in terms of truck travel costs, fleet size, and GHG emissions. Sensitivity analysis will be performed under 
different mixtures of diesel trucks and BEHDTs.

Abstract 
Electricity is widely used to manufacture goods and services in all sectors of the economy. While a country's standard 
of living and degree of economic development is primarily determined by its energy use, electricity generation and 
distribution influence productivity and overall economic growth. Unfortunately, many developing nations, like 
Nigeria, are still unable to supply their populations with enough long-term power, which is essential to enhance their 
standard of life and fuel economic progress. 
Despite being Africa's largest economy, only around 60% of the Nigeria’s 200 million residents has access to electric 
power. With a rapidly expanding population, it is critical to increase electrical supply to satisfy demand. The Federal 
Government of Nigeria (FGN) wants to boost access to power from 45 percent to 90 percent by 2030. 
This paper examines policies created from 2001 to 2020 to investigate how they increased the country's generation 
and supply of electricity. The findings demonstrate that, because Nigeria is still in the early phases of economic 
development, it would be sensible to promote renewable energy to boost the economy, decrease energy poverty, and 
protect the environment. This may be accomplished by diversifying the country's energy mix and constructing 
renewable energy power plants.

1. Introduction
Energy poverty, climate change, and energy supply security are three fundamental concerns that the world faces today 
in the realm of Energy (Zhao  et al. 2022). As environmental concerns have grown in recent years, the problem of 
energy poverty has gotten much attention. Energy poverty is a multidimensional issue with many aspects. As a result, 
many academics approach energy poverty from different viewpoints  (Igawa  2022). Energy poverty has been used to 
describe the absence of household energy services or fuel poverty. Research in energy poverty in high-income and 
low-income countries distinguishes between accessibility and cost. At the same time, energy poverty in low-income 
nations has received attention on developing countries' lack of access to electrical grids. Energy poverty in high-
income nations has focused on the affordability component (Zhao  et al. 2022).  
Igawa et al. offer three ways to differentiate the accessibility and affordability at a global level. Firstly, access to 
electricity has increased by 10% in the previous two decades, reaching 90% in 2018. Recent research on energy

6. Conclusion  
Nigeria's electrical infrastructure serves around 60% of its population; however, the power is unreliable and 
insufficient. As a result, most Nigerian families produce power using generators or solar panels  (Elegbede, Kerr et al. 
2021). They do, however, demand more stable, economic, and long-term electrical sources. 
According to this analysis, Nigeria's power sector challenges may be remedied if appropriate regulations are put in 
place to encourage renewable energy investors. For example, households with direct electrical connections might 
employ off-grid solar to transition to cleaner, renewable energy sources. This opens the possibility of building 
additional power plants to generate and distribute electricity to areas and consumers who are not currently serviced by 
the national grid. This calls for cleaner and more sustainable power to be generated by utilising the country's untapped 
natural resources, such as wind, biomass, and tidal.

Abstract 
This paper focused on the application of marketing management concepts in product oriented 
engineering establishments where the introduction of a new product, bio coal was studied. The Porter’s 
generic studies were assumed and applied during the market analysis to ensure positive product impact 
in the market. Superstar marketing was adopted as the market penetration strategy to capture many 
customers. The Marketing Management Information System (MMIS) was adopted as a tool for effective 
bio coal marketing. 
Keywords: Bio coal, marketing management, MMIS, product marketing cycle 
1. Introduction
Marketing Management permits for meeting the optimal customer satisfaction necessities as well as ensuring that 
the establishment through the process is getting a turnover. During the process of Marketing Management, the 
establishment identifies the customer needs to be satisfied, design a product to meet those needs and ensure that 
it is better than existing products. Subsequently, the establishment converses the benefits to the users in order to 
promote higher purchase. The product must be at the right place and the right time and must also consider the 
available competition. The summary of the essential marketing concepts is shown in Figure 1.

The data which is composed from the external sources cannot be used straight but must be first assessed and 
organized in a proper order. It can be then used by the Marketing Manager for taking decisions and making policies 
about marketing. 
So, marketing intelligence is an important component of MIS. 
5.3 Marketing Research 
The third significant constituent of MIS is the Marketing Research (MR). MR is done to solve specific marketing 
problems of the company for example in this case to investigate on the potential to increase the heating value of 
the bio coal. MR gathers information about the problem, this data is tabularized, examined and deductions are 
drawn (Kotler  1997). Then the recommendations are given for solving the problem. MR also delivers material to 
the marketing managers. However, this information is exact information and can be used only for a precise 
purpose.  
5.4 Marketing Decision Support System 
The fourth component of MIS is the Marketing Decision Support System. These are the tools which help the 
marketing managers to evaluate data and to take improved marketing decisions. They include hardware i.e. 
computer and software programs such as STATISTICA for data analysis (Mougayar. 1998). Computers help the 
Marketing Manager to examine the marketing info and also help them to take better decisions. In actual fact, today 
marketing managers cannot work without computers. There are many software programs, which help the 
marketing manager to do market segmentation, price fixing and advertising budgets. 
6. Conclusion
Marketing Management is critical in meeting the marketing targets for product oriented engineering 
establishments. The effective marketing of bio coal can be highly achieved through application of the marketing 
generic studies and conducting a detailed analysis. Having a detailed MMIS for the bio coal value chain to the 
market will enhance decision making in sales support.

1. Introduction
For more than a decade, the Internet has fueled active consumer participation. As of January 2021, the Philippines 
recorded 73.91 million internet users (Datareportal, 2021), an increase of 6.1% between 2020 and 2021. In the 
aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak, the country continues to depend on e-commerce to cope with economic recovery. 
The Philippines' e-commerce industry has seen a spike as lockdown measures have impacted brick-and-mortar firms. 
As an outcome, the importance of e-commerce was recognized in the country, which signifies economic recovery and 
growth. With e-commerce's contribution of 3.4% to the country's GDP in 2020 (Department of Trade and Industry, 
2021), this shows that there is economic potential for the surge of the use of e-commerce. The shopping platforms 
have become a tool of most retailers because of the government restrictions for health protocols in the public areas of 
the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the GWI report of Q3 2020, a broad survey conducted 
for internet users aged 16 to 64, 87.8% of the users visited an online retail site or store using any device. On the same 
report, 85.7% of the users used shopping platforms, and 80.2% purchased a product online. These numbers indicated 
a significant e-commerce activity of the Filipinos. 
This research study will cover the top five most visited e-commerce sites in the Philippines, Shopee, Lazada, Zalora, 
eBay, and the Facebook Marketplace (Statista, 2021). As limited as these platforms are, there is still a need to measure 
customer satisfaction to improve their services further. Many customers started using shopping platforms rather than

Abstract 
Offsite construction technique presents substantially speedier construction processes whilst lowering construction 
wastes. The level of prefabricated for offsite construction projects depends largely on the amount of complexity and 
the level of prefabricated components, which can be classified into two levels such as 2D penalized and 3D volumetric 
construction. However, there is often no specific method adoptable for determining the level of prefabrication 
construction. This research aims to determine the level of prefabrication requirement for offsite construction and their 
significance.  An online database collected for offsite construction projects was analysed with decision making models. 
The results revealed that the building volume, i.e., the building footprint and height were the most influential factors. 
Furthermore, three other factors related to timber material, low-income target user, and residential function of 
prefabricated projects were also identified as crucial in deciding the prefabrication level. The research concluded with 
certain guidance recommended for choosing the appropriate prefabrication level for building construction. For 
example, penalized construction generally had a higher level of implementation than volumetric construction in 
prefabrication.  
Keywords Building performance, Offsite construction, prefabrication level, Determining factor and Penalized 
construction. 
1. Introduction
Prefabricated construction， also known as off-site construction or modern method of construction (MMC), is a 
modern construction approach consisting of two working sites, i.e., the off-site manufacturing site and construction 
site (Wuni and Shen, 2020). The prefabricated components are built in an offsite once the design is completed, then 
delivered to a construction site for assembly (Jiang et al. 2018). Offsite construction is an important trend in building 
industrialization, as it helps enhance the characteristic of the construction industry which has been largely dependent 
on traditional on-site construction (Young et al. 2020). The prefabricated construction method provides substantial 
advantages, such as reducing environmental effects, shortening project duration and improving productivity (Mostafa 
et al., 2020). Bertram et al. (2019) claimed that offsite construction can reduce project duration by 20% to 50 % and 
construction costs by 20 %. However, the term ‘prefabrication element’ covers a range of different approaches, 
systems, and forms (Bertram et al.2019). It can be any component/s, sub-assemblies, volumetric pre-assembly, or 
modular building (Apaydın  2011).  
The levels of prefabrication can be different according to the degree of complexity and the scale of the prefabricated 
component. Mostafa et al. (2020) stated that not every design is suitable for the highest level of prefabrication and 
assembly technique (i.e., 3D volumetric modules) as certain situations could make it less competitive. Therefore, in 
order to maximize the benefits of prefabrication, finding the suitable prefabrication level to fit different situations is 
crucial. This study examines the benefits and challenges of different levels of prefabrication in construction. The study 
also adopts a wide-ranging qualitative approach by analysing project samples collected from the industry. Utilizing a 
decision-making model for investors to decide prefabrication level, the study defines inputting features of projects in 
107","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

These attributes or critical input factors were initially identified from the 80 real off-site projects found. Each factor 
for deciding prefabrication level was analyzed in terms of the importance ranking. Five recommendations for deciding 
suitable prefabrication level were provided: 1) For the ‘building footprint and height’ factor, it was suggested to choose 
volumetric construction for the projects that had a less than 2500 ㎡ footprint with 3-8 stories. Meanwhile, for the 
projects that were more than 2500 ㎡ in footprint and more than eight-floor in height or the super-low projects with 
no more than 2 stories, the penalized construction might be more suitable for economic benefits; 2) regarding factor 
of building function and target user, it was not that essential to impact the decision of prefabrication level.  
 
However, when it came to residential projects or projects for low-income people, such as affordable housing and 
temporary shelter for the homeless, it was suggested to adopt 3D modular construction; 3) as for the attribute of 
construction material, the utilization of timber structure in volumetric construction should be carefully considered, 
because it could lead to poor building thermal condition. However, the new material and technology had been 
emerging rapidly. Via working with new material, the building constructed by timber modules could significantly 
reduce the occurrence of poor thermal condition. The wide utilization of CLT (i.e., cross-laminated timber) guarantees 
the insulating qualities of massive wood. The construction material was no longer a constraint in deciding 
prefabrication level of construction projects.  
 
However, the timber structure could still be considered an essential factor that could decide the prefabrication level; 
4) in terms of project location, since the development of the offsite construction differ among countries; for these 
countries with insufficient technologies and immature market for higher level of prefabrication, it was suggested to 
utilize penalized construction instead of volumetric block system; 5) the importance ranking of all the factors indicated 
that the building volume (i.e. building footprint and height) was the most influential factor deciding the prefabrication 
level of construction projects. Besides the building footprint & height, the construction material, function and target 
user of a building could also impact the prefabrication level of an offsite project. Overall, the timber material, 
residential function and low-income target user were the three most influential elements next to building footprint & 
height. The project location was the least important factor among all.  
 
By using the given suggestions and the decision-making model, it would be possible to reduce the problems and risks 
caused by unsuitable prefabrication levels. Nevertheless, the decision-making tool is relatively a simple model which 
was constructed by inputting only the most critical factors in this study. Future research can focus on conducting a 
more comprehensive analysis of critical input factors affecting the prefabrication level. These factors would contain 
more attributes such as the life span of the building (e.g., temporary or permanent) and the technical equipment to 
install so that a more accurate decision-making model can be delivered in more effectively deciding the prefabrication 
level.  
 
5. Conclusion  
The purpose of this paper is to help stakeholders including investors and designers decide the most suitable 
prefabrication level for construction projects. The volumetric construction and penalized construction were compared 
based on building performance in the operation stage. The results reveal that the penalized construction seems a better 
choice for offsite construction projects. Whereas, without considering the differences of projects, the suggestion 
cannot be conclusive. Since various factors can affect the prefabrication level of a modular building, the study adopts 
the decision tree model for analysing the identified critical input factors, and their significance. 
 
The analysis suggests that building height & footprint should be emphasized as top priority for deciding prefabricated 
level. Additionally, the construction material, target user and building functions are also relatively important factors. 
Specifically, the three attributes related to timber material, low income target user, and residential function of 
prefabricated projects should be highlighted as more critical factors. Moreover, the specific suggestion is that the 
volumetric construction should be utilized more in projects with these attributes: having less than 2500 ㎡ footprint 
with 3-8 stories, low-income user, timber material, and residential function. Instead, penalized construction can be 
applied to projects with these attributes: more than 2500 ㎡ footprint, over 8 stories or low rise projects, no more than 
2 stories, non-low-income user, non-timber material, and non-residential function.

Abstract 
The ready-made garment (RMG) sector of Bangladesh is one of the largest garment manufacturing sectors in the 
world. Fire incidents in RMG factories are always a highly discussed issue among local and international policymakers 
and stakeholders. An efficient prioritization of the remedial actions for fire risks can aid the decision-makers to 
mitigate the fire hazards and associated damages. This study, thereby, proposes a hybrid Multi-criteria Decision-
making (MCDM) framework, combining Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted 
Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method, to prioritize the remedial actions for fire risks in RMG 
factories. At first, the 16 most important remedial actions have been identified by a panel of experts. For the evaluation 
of the identified actions, four evaluation criteria- initial cost, maintenance cost, feasibility, and risk reductant- have 
been selected from both the literature review and expert feedback. By using the SWARA method, the study finds 
‘initial cost’ and ‘risk reductant’ to be the two criteria with the highest weights. Later, using the obtained criteria 
weights, the WASPAS method finds that ‘proper electrical wiring and connections’, ‘separating the gas cylinders from 
the main production building’, and ‘keeping egress paths and stairs clear of obstruction’ are the top three prioritized 
remedial actions that can be taken to mitigate fire risks in the RMG industries. Results obtained from this research are 
expected to help the managers of RMG industries to devise an effective fire risk remedial action plan, within their 
technical constraints and limited resources, to ensure a safe workplace for their workers.

1. Introduction
Ready-made garments from Bangladesh are exported to 150 countries of the world and it is an industry aged more 
than four decades (BGMEA 2021). A safe and sustainable working environment is an important factor for the 
reputation and stability of such an important industrial sector. However, fire incidents have become a critical issue in 
recent times, which has created a major hindrance in the way of achieving a safe and sustainable working environment 
in the RMG sector (Hasan et al. 2017). Several deadly fire incidents in RMG factories have caused the death of 
hundreds of people in the last few decades. Among those, the fire incident in Tazreen Fashion in 2012 is noteworthy, 
which caused the death of more than 100 people. The incident drew attention from the national as well as the 
international community to find an effective and sustainable solution for the fire hazards in the RMG factories 
(Wiersma  2018).  
By conducting continuous fire safety inspections as well as providing remedial suggestions and corrective action plans, 
it is possible to drive the number of deadly fire incidents to a minimum (Accord  2021; Hasan et al.  2019). Therefore, 
the remedial suggestions made in the factory inspection reports after analyzing the existing risk factors can carry

Abstract 
Picking is a basic process within warehouse management, comprising the activities carried out since the order is 
received until the products are located in the warehouse and are ready for dispatch. The objective of this study was to 
optimize the productivity of the picking process in a Peruvian food company. For this purpose, a pre-test and post-test 
methodology was designed with a qualitative and descriptive approach in order to suggest an innovative proposal. 
Lean Warehousing techniques, such as 5s and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) were utilized, as well as an inventory 
record automation model and ADKAR, a change management model. The proposal was validated through pilot tests 
and a simulation in the Arena software (16.1 version), proving its effectiveness in increasing productivity by more 
than 36%. The value of this study lies in that it can be applied both in companies in the same sector or other areas that 
have their own warehouse and want to increase its productivity.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, companies have been forced to meet the particular needs demanded by customers. The market trend has 
changed; it is no longer the company that decides which products to sell, but rather, it is the company that must adapt 
to offer the products that are in demand. The situation becomes more complicated when it is necessary to ensure 
fluency in the chain, from the moment the customer's need is identified until it is met. For an efficient supply chain, 
productivity levels must be guaranteed and constantly demanded to be improved at each stage. For this reason, this 
study will consider one of the determining elements in the performance of the chain: management of the picking area 
in the warehouse. 
Picking is a basic process within warehouse management, which comprises the activities that take place from the 
moment the order is received until the products are placed in the warehouse and are prepared for dispatch. It is 
estimated that the management of this area represents 55% of the total operating expense of the warehouse, which 
128","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Rome, Italy, July 26-28, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
were applied, which directly influenced the reduction of picking times. Finally, for the improvements applied to be 
sustainable over time and to generate employee commitment, the change management model, ADKAR, was applied.  
 
An initial analysis was carried out in order to diagnose the main problems in the warehouse. As a result, it was found 
that productivity in the picking area was 26.8% below the industry standard. Then, the main causes were identified, 
which were the deficient inventory registration system, the lack of predetermined inventory locations in the warehouse, 
the lack of delimited spaces for picking activities and the aisles occupied by pallets pending storage.  
 
As for the results obtained, the 5s allowed to increase the compliance of the audit performed from 62% to 100%, by 
applying different organizational techniques related to the components of the tool: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, 
and sustain. The same happens in the research by Salgado Heredia (2018) where they applied the 5s tool with the 
purpose of reducing activities that did not add value, thus increasing productivity. Likewise, the research conducted 
by Uárez Eleorraga et al. (2021) coincides with the study conducted, since during the process of introducing the tool, 
they considered that the collaboration of the personnel was fundamental to obtain better results, as well as the 
subsequent training to ensure a correct implementation of the 5s. 
 
On the other hand, the simulation in Arena of the SLP tool and the automation of the inventory registration system 
showed that a 26.9% reduction in picking time was achieved, by reducing both the product search time and the product 
handling movements. This case is similar to that of Silva et al. (2020), where they also carried out a reordering of the 
warehouse, since both studies agree that a fundamental problem in the picking area is the lack of predetermined 
locations for product allocation. Another similar case is that of Prasetyawan et al. (2020) since, in both studies, one of 
the main causes of inefficiency in warehouse activities is the inaccuracy of the manual inventory management system. 
However, while in the study in question such a system was automated as a solution, in the research in comparison 
labeling and sorting techniques are used to decrease the company's waste and consequently achieve information 
accuracy. 
 
Finally, the application of the change management model, ADKAR, allowed the applied improvements to be 
sustainable over time, generating awareness of the need for change, desire for participation, knowledge to face change, 
constant support for the development of skills, and continuous accompaniment to reinforce what has been learned. 
This model is also applied in the study conducted by Carranza and Yuptón (2019), where a Peruvian school sought to 
adapt to the changing environment using a questionnaire technique to analyze the dimensions of the model and to 
know the direct opinion of the collaborators. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The improvement proposal was effective in demonstrating that the different tools applied significantly increased the 
productivity of the picking area, achieving the objectives initially set.  The application of the 5s made it possible to 
increase compliance with the audit from 62% to 100%, by applying different organizational techniques related to the 
tool's components. The implementation of the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and the inventory register 
automation model, validated by means of the Arena software, allowed reducing the average time of picking activities 
by 26.9%, after reducing the time of the search of the register order and the extraction of the merchandise. The change 
management model, ADKAR, validated through training and a pilot questionnaire, showed that a successful change 
could be implemented in the organization, obtaining an average score of 4.56 per question, out of a maximum of 5 
points. The integration of the previously mentioned tools successfully increased the productivity of the picking area 
by 36.5%, obtaining a productivity of 180.7 packages/hour and successfully reaching the industry standards. Finally, 
the transferability of this study lies in the possibility of being applied in other SMEs in the sector and other industries, 
as well as in logistics companies seeking to increase the productivity of the picking area. To this effect, the reports 
detailed throughout this study facilitate that the methodology can be replicated in other contexts.

Abstract 
Urgency of accomplishing a certain task within any project is always considered as a common situation. Improvisation 
happens when the project manager must deal with unexpected situations within a specific schedule and limited data. 
This paper aims to present a review of how improvisation has been addressed through the literature within projects 
and project management perspectives and what are the factors that affect it. This review has been undertaken by 
defining project, project management, improvisation, and how it leads to project success. This has been considered by 
analyzing various studies related to improvisation. The paper will help the project managers to understand the concept 
of improvisation, how it is important to project, and the required factors to be considered to obtain successful project 
outcomes. It has been proved in this research that a project manager to be able to improvise successfully must have 
knowledge, experience, and being trained. This research will help project managers to understand how to improvise 
successfully by knowing the required skills to focus on to improve themselves. Moreover, this research suggested a 
model that includes factors to be evaluated based on their impact on successful improvisation. The suggested factors 
that could impact the project manager decision are experience, age, and training. At the end, a successful improvisation 
will result in successful project outcome when the project is within the schedule, budget, and meets the quality 
requirement. In addition, the introduced model and hypotheses can be evaluated on further study and more factors can 
be considered.

Factors, Knowledge, Project, Project Management, and Improvisation. 
1. Introduction
Knowledge is considered as an essential topic to be focused on. Bredillet (2007) found out that project management 
is considered as an important field of study within the area of knowledge. Mclnerney (2002) described knowledge as 
dynamic and power because it creates a change. In addition, knowledge is always varying based on gaining new 
experience and learning and because of that it is described as dynamic. On the other hand, Gupta et al. (2000) defined 
knowledge management as a combination of searching, organizing, choosing, and conveying information and 
experience that help the organization in dealing with issues, educating, and making decisions.  
There are various reasons that lead to project failure such as the lack of knowledge and it is essential in project 
management. In addition, the role of the project manager is essential to help the organization to reach its desired goals 
and to improve its services and handling of different projects. It is important to understand the difference between 
project and project management. Project means achieving the objectives based on certain tasks and activities by using 
resources to deliver the project outcomes. On the other hand, project management is a process for controlling the 
achievement of the objectives. The final project outcomes can be either success or fail and this can be decided based

impacts on the decision. Based on the factors from the literature review, it is suggested to test three main factors which 
are experience, age, and training.  
 
Experience: As it was found in the literature that experience is one of the most significant factors to improvisation and 
different studies proved that. In addition, it was mentioned by Klien et al. (2015) that improvisation is the dependence 
on knowledge and experience of project manager to accomplish a task and achieve the desired goals. In some cases, 
the project manager needs the opinion of the team members as they are more involved in the processes and details 
which means they understand more based on their experience in the field.  
 
Hypothesis (1): The level of experience has a significant impact on project manager improvisation.  
Age: The result in the literature varies from no affection on improvisation to slightly affection. Based on that, this 
factor may affect the success of improvisation and need to be evaluated. Age plays an important role in decision 
making because it is always connected with experience and education. 
 
Hypothesis (2): Age has a significant impact on project manager improvisation. 
Training: This factor is very important and useful for self-development, and it was found in the literature review that 
this factor influences improvisation. Training is not only important to project manager but also to the team members 
to help them in handling the project and delivering the result successfully.  
 
Hypothesis (3): Training has a significant impact on project manager improvisation. 
To test the developed hypotheses in this research, it is suggested to develop a survey to measure and evaluate the 
impact of each factor on the decision. It was found out in the literature that seven points Likert scales (1 = Strongly 
Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Somewhat Disagree, 4 = Neither Agree nor Disagree, 5 = Somewhat Agree, 6 = Agree, 7 
= Strongly Agree) was used to measure the factors in the survey. Questions can be added under each factor in the 
survey, and it is suggested to collect the data from different project managers within different fields. In addition, more 
factors can be added to test if they have an impact on the decision such as education, gender, and organization type.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The purpose of this paper was to undertake a review of the academic literature on ‘improvisation’ within the context 
of project management and the factors that affect improvisation. The literature review shows the importance of 
knowledge and experience in leading to successful project outcomes. Project and project management are two different 
terms that have been addressed in the literature review section. Project includes tasks and activities that lead to achieve 
objectives while project management is the process that control and lead to achieve objectives (Munns & Bjeirmi, 
1996). On the other hand, improvisation is an act to unexpected situation that requires immediate decision with limited 
data and resources. It occurs to help continuing the project and the project manager must have enough experience to 
improvise with successful project outcome. It is also necessary for the project manager to focus on improving the 
quality of work, training, experience to have successful project outcomes. This research proposes a model for the 
sequence of improvisation within a project in an organization along with hypotheses which will help in understanding 
the factors that affect the decision making and in particular how it is related to improvisation. In addition, more factors 
can be studied along with the factors that have been introduced in this study which are experience, age, and training. 
These factors need to be studied to check the affection on final project outcomes in terms of cost, time, and quality. 
Moreover, for future research it is suggested to establish a survey that covers the factors that need to be evaluated in 
order to be able to check if the hypotheses are supported or not.

Abstract 
Growing global supply chain trends across different industries have driven enormous changes and complexity of 
traditional supply chain management (SCM). Simultaneously, unprecedented disruptions impacting worldwide 
commerce further add more vulnerabilities to current SCM practices. The most recent Covid-19 pandemic is a major 
global catastrophe that has created unpredictable disruptions towards supply chain activities and caused interruptions, 
especially in supply or sourcing activities. This low-frequency and high-impact disruption have created severe ripple 
effects in SCM, resulting from propagation of disturbance from upstream point of supply to downstream part of 
production and distribution. While traditional SCM focuses more on developing initial strategies to avoid forecasted 
future risks, Covid-19 phenomenon has forced SCM practitioners to propose modern SCM with agile and resilient 
risk management capability to adapt and respond quickly to unpredictable risk. However, it is found that only a scarce 
number of academic papers have suggested appropriate supply chain risk management (SCRM) solutions for the 
commercial sector while most addressed the issues in humanitarian SCM. Hence, this paper aims to investigate the 
phenomenon of supply shortage as the root problem of ripple effects in the supply chain caused by Covid-19 pandemic 
and propose effective SCRM to build an agile and resilient commerce supply chain for responding to the disruptions. 
Beyond that, the objective of this research is to also provide a clearer picture of the critical role of SCRM in the future 
post-pandemic world that is advantageous for supporting agile and resilient decision-making processes to turn risks 
into opportunities.  
The study first provides a comprehensive review of existing literature related to SCM and SCRM as the basis to define 
measurements in assessing and improving supply chain agility and resilience. Based on this preliminary study, a 
simulation modeling approach based on real-life case study is designed, and experimental results are presented to 
depict more conceptual and realistic illustrations. This paper implements a combination of agent-based and discrete-
event simulation methodology with AnyLogic simulation software. Through this proposed approach, the paper finally 
concludes with providing managerial insights on SCRM, particularly for strategic sourcing and identifying 
possibilities for potential research areas. The findings and recommendations from this paper can be further exploited 
for advancing SCRM based on simulation technology in real-life practices as an integral part of modern supply chain 
capabilities. In turn, this paper contributes to help supply chain practitioners accumulate better understanding on the 
importance role of agile and resilient SCRM, especially in sourcing activities during disruptions period, and effective 
methodology for its real-world implementation that supports making investment decisions in priority settings.

Abstract 
In the on-demand ridesharing services (ODRS), a business revolves around situations that urge individuals to rely 
on parties they have never encountered. As uncertainties are inevitable, trust acts as the fuse that ignites the whole 
industry. Currently, few scholars have studied trust dimensions concerning the ODRS, particularly in developing 
countries. This study aims to grasp a complete understanding of trust in this industry by incorporating its 
antecedents: familiarity and reputation with the multiple dimensions of trust: trust in a peer, a platform, and a 
product, alongside its implication towards its continuance intention to use. The study involved 215 respondents, 
and utilized a PLS-SEM analysis. The result shows that reputation significantly influences trust's multiple 
dimensions, while familiarity does not. Furthermore, all trust dimensions significantly contributed to the 
continuance intention to use. Companies can use this study to construct trust and stimulate intention to participate 
in the ODRS.

1. Introduction
The growth of the sharing economy has resulted in a significant shift in customer consumption habits (Hawlitschek 
et al. 2016; Mittendorf 2017). However, most previous studies tended to overlook the sharing economy in 
developing nations (Hira & Reilly  2017; Ma et al. 2018; Paundra et al. 2020). The value of the sharing economy 
may be greater in developing countries since it allows users to access productive utilities they cannot easily 
purchase while also providing an alternative source of revenue (United Nations 2020). On-demand ridesharing 
services (ODRS hereafter) are among the most popular kinds of the sharing economy. ODRS provides more 
convenience, lower prices, and enhanced comfort. It comes as no surprise that a large number of clients have 
moved from traditional forms of transportation to ODRS (Azizah & Adawia 2018). 
Trust is essential in ODRS and regarded as the engine that propels the whole business. Undoubtedly, it is one of 
the primary drivers that facilitate transactions between strangers in an internet world fraught with uncertainty. 
Customers are continually put in a precarious situation where they must rely on someone they have never met 
before (Hawlitschek et al.  2016; ter Huurne et al. 2017). As a result, it is vitally essential for providers to establish 
trust to attract customers. Nonetheless, ODRS frequently faces trust challenges, ranging from data exploitation 
and security to passenger safety, with incidences of assault or harassment looming over the sector (Chaudhry et 
al., 2018; Chee, 2018; Papadopoulou et al. 2001). Trust is frequently disregarded in the existing sharing economy 
research (Cheng 2016; Möhlmann 2015). As a result, more studies can contribute to a more comprehensive 
understanding of trust's effect on continuance intention to participate in the sharing economy environment 
provided by ODRS companies. 
Several authors have explored the topic of trust. However, only a few researchers have developed a model that 
integrates the antecedents of trust, the multiple targets of trust, and its further implications – continuance intention 
to use (Hawlitschek et al. 2016; Mittendorf, 2017; Ye et al. 2019). The model created by Hawlitschek et al. (2016) 
is the fundamental principle of this research. It differentiates trust into three specific dimensions: trust in a peer, 
154",,"Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

towards establishing a reputation. A reputation is built by showing trustworthy behaviour to the customers and 
providing exquisite products and services. To demonstrate such a behavior, an ODRS provider should deliver 
precise information concerning its products and services, promotions and conditions, and other necessary items or 
protective measures to suppress the uncertainties that may emerge from the customers in every situation possible. 
In the sharing economy, where uncertainties abound, ambiguous information will only increase customer 
skepticism. As a result, ODRS providers must be able to elaborate accurately information. Creating a clear 
payment and monitoring mechanism in ODRS might also aid in promoting a positive reputation. Furthermore, to 
emphasize trustworthy behavior, ODRS providers should connect with customers often. ODRS suppliers might 
readily communicate with their customers via social media by answering queries, listening to their ideas, and even 
reacting to their critiques. A positive reputation will be generated by demonstrating that the organization is present 
and willing to listen to its customers. 
Furthermore, companies should consistently provide sturdy products and services. For ODRS providers, it means 
that they must impose a standard respecting the driver-partners and vehicle's competencies to ensure that they 
meet the customers' requirements in every transaction. Customers want the finest products and services, and if 
ODRS providers fail to provide them, the former may convey their dissatisfaction through bad word-of-mouth. In 
contrast, if ODRS providers effectively deploy trustworthy driver-partners and vehicles for customers, the 
organization may create favorable word-of-mouth and a positive reputation. Finally, ODRS providers might detect 
which sections of their business are functioning well or poorly by leveraging the availability of reputation systems 
such as scores and ratings. If they notice that their mobile applications receive low ratings, they can determine 
which aspects should be updated. If ODRS drivers and vehicles are regarded as outstanding by customers, ODRS 
providers may focus on continually upgrading them to grow their companies. ODRS providers should 
continuously improve the competencies of their drivers and vehicles, boost the performance of their mobile 
applications, and maintain customer relationships through public relations to further stimulate the continuance 
intention to use ODRS.

Limitations and Suggestions for Further Study
In spite of attempting to conceive a model of research that is most fitting for readers, unfortunately, this study is
not entirely free of flaws. For example, the majority of respondents gathered were university students from the
age of 15 to 24 years old, meaning that it may not represent an entire population of ODRS platform users in
Indonesia. Moreover, even though the hypotheses were already proven, there is still room for additional studies
on other dimensions of trust, such as the ability, integrity, and benevolence trait (Locke et al., 2009) or even other
antecedents such as personal lifestyle and perceived risks. Also, future studies could be performed from an
unfamiliar perspective, perhaps of the ODRS providers. Finally, considering the timeline of this study that was
conducted during the pandemic situation, it might not fully represent true responses as some oe respondents were
not so often in using their regular ODRS platform as before the pandemic. Potentially, it would be better to conduct 
this research at a different time.

Abstract 
The high use of the internet has a significant effect on human activity and one of the most affected is online sales via 
the internet. Many conveniences result from e-commerce both for sellers and for buyers. However, in e-commerce 
transactions, the customer's position is weak in the sense that customers cannot monitor their transactions transparently 
so that e-commerce transactions harm customers, such as the goods sent by the seller do not match what was ordered, 
the seller cancels the transaction unilaterally and so on. Meanwhile, blockchain technology offers a high level of 
transparency and security based on peer to peer transactions, so blockchain technology can protect customers in e-
commerce transactions. The purpose of this research is to protect customers in e-commerce transactions using

as well as parties involved in e-commerce transactions such as shipping companies. So when 
an e-commerce transaction occurs, the shipping company receives information and validates 
the transaction, as well as the bank as an institution that facilitates payment transactions. 
c. 
If all nodes have received a new block of information in the blockchain network that has been 
validated, the block will enter into a part of a ledger that contains all the blocks that have been 
arranged previously. 
 
 
 
Figure 2 . The proposed Model 
 
5. Conclusion  
The combination of e-commerce with blockchain technology provides several advantages for customers from fraud, 
for example, fraudulent goods sent not in accordance with the order, this fraud can be avoided by the shipping company 
who is given the responsibility for sending goods will refuse delivery transactions because in the blockchain network 
all nodes know everything e-commerce transactions. The illustration above also applies to transactions between all 
stakeholders in the blockchain network.

Abstract 
Business start-ups are companies that are newly established and are in the development and research phase to find the 
right market based on information technology. However, business start-ups as a new business have difficulty 
developing their business due to their limited knowledge and experience, therefore business start-ups need a system

Storage Layer
Is part of the KMS that stores all the knowledge from internal and external business startup communities.
Internal knowledge is knowledge that comes from within the startup community based on the knowledge and
experience they have. When collaborative learning occurs, business startups can become instructors with
their knowledge. The storage layer also stores knowledge from experts where knowledge will be discussed
and shared when collaborative learning occurs. In addition to the two types of knowledge described above,
there is one knowledge that comes from online sources such as social media and other online sources.
b.
Personalization Knowledge Process
This section is the section that processes knowledge based on the specific needs of the user. One of the
common needs for knowledge is search engine knowledge where users can search for the required knowledge 
based on this feature. Another example is data mining knowledge where the feature provides the ability to
find relationships in the knowledge database .
c.
Presentation Service
d.
This feature provides a set of services that can be used to use the system. The initial design allows users to
access the system with various different software and hardware platforms with the aim of making it easier
for users to use the system
e.
Social Interaction
This section is the core of collaborative learning in the business startup community where there are 2 different 
main actors, namely business startups and digital business experts or practitioners. In collaborative learning,
the two actors can take turns being a student and an instructor.
5. Conclusion
A model that integrates a knowledge management system with collaborative learning is an ideal solution for business 
start-ups because social interactions will generate new knowledge. During social interaction, it is also a means to share 
knowledge. If you pay more attention to social interactions during collaborative learning

Abstract 
Limited Human Resources inherent in Most SMEs that grow traditionally and are family businesses that have been 
passed down from generation to generation. The limited human resources of SMEs, both in terms of formal education 
and knowledge and skills, affect the management of their business, so that it is difficult for SMEs to develop optimally. 
In addition, with limited knowledge, SMEs find it difficult to adopt new technological developments to increase the 
competitiveness of the products they produce. On the other hand, the evolution of KM and e-learning influence each

so that its existence is integrated with other databases. As we know that there are many components of data or 
information in e-learning systems such as student data, course data, lecturer data and others, so that this section 
functions as an integration process for two databases from two different systems. 
 
E-learning system is represented by 2 main components, namely LMS or Learning Management System and Database. 
LMS is the main system in e-learning that manages the computer-based learning process. LMS manages all parts that 
support online learning such as information about students, instructors, course schedules, syllabus and others.

4. Conclusion  
This research resulted in a combination of KMS and LMS to increase the knowledge of SMEs. The resulting model 
is a solution to the problem of the low knowledge of SMEs while on the other hand other SMEs who are members of 
the SME community have knowledge that is useful for other SMEs but there is no one medium that SMEs can use to 
share their knowledge. On the other hand, e-learning provides a solution for SMEs to gain knowledge systematically 
and the structure provided by the LMS which is part of this model.

Abstract 
With technological development and digital transformation, the social commerce model has quickly become the best 
strategy for delivering a superior shopping experience. Although the history and evolution of the model can be studied, 
the future of the model is uncertain and may become an even more complex and diverse concept. However, new 
technologies and tendencies such as Web 3.0, the metaverse, and NFTs may give us a glimpse of the future. In this 
article, an analysis was conducted on the current scenario and evolution of the model based on the article ""A systematic 
review on social commerce"" by Esmaeili and Alireza, which discloses results from 2014 to 2017. Fifty-two journal 
articles were selected to update the answers to the 5 W´s model presented in the article mentioned above. The results 
revealed not only the evolution of the model but also the evolution of the approach of the companies when building 
their social commerce platform.

1. Introduction
More than a hundred years ago, the emergence of new technologies such as the radio, phones, or TVs began to lay the 
groundwork for a transformation from a world based mostly on face-to-face interactions into a world full of virtual 
experiences. However, since this transformation started, there has never been an adaptation as obliged as the one 
experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic. Suddenly the world was paralyzed and day-to-day activities such as work, 
education, entertainment, and shopping were obliged to adapt to a virtual environment. Nevertheless, the experience 
lived through these virtual environments still cannot be compared to physical experiences, mainly because users are 
motivated by fulfilling 5 different needs: emotional, social, functional, self-oriented, and relational (Yahia et al. 2018). 
Despite a few virtual industries that satisfy most of these needs, such as the gaming industry, the vast majority won´t 
meet more than two. 
As a result of technological developments and the constant search to satisfy user needs, a new form of commerce that 
combines the characteristics of traditional electronic commerce (e-commerce) with social networks called social 
commerce (s-commerce) arises (Wang et al. 2019). This type of commerce intends to provide the consumer with a 
service or product based on their preferences, interests, and interactions through the web (Gibreel et al. 2018) using 
Web 2.0 (Yahia et al. 2018) software and new channels. These allow users to make better purchasing decisions and 
have a better experience thanks to the interaction with each other and the content they generate (Wang et al. 2019). 
1.1 Objectives 
This study is based on the article ""A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON SOCIAL COMMERCE"" by Esmaeili and 
Hashemi, which presents the results and main changes that occurred from 2014 to 2017 related to social media 
platforms and intend to perform an analysis on the current scenario and the evolution of the model.  
2. Literature Review
Having customers who develop loyalty towards the business is critical to the success and profitability of any business 
(Chiu et al. 2009) since, in terms of time and effort, acquiring new customers costs more than retaining existing ones 
(Chong et al. 2018). E-commerce differs from s-commerce as the latter is assigned commercial objectives, customer

reality worlds. This might mean a virtual experience almost exactly like physical experiences and only time will say 
if it would be possible to recreate real-life situations in a virtual environment. 
 
Nevertheless, this is not the only technology that might influence the model. Blockchain technology and Web 3.0 
development will revolutionize the evolution of s-commerce, in which each user would be able to manage their 
decentralized platform instead of relying on technological giants such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Additionally, 
s-commerce will probably evolve to commercialize NFTs as digital assets, adding social features to a platform model 
that already exists such as Opensea, Axie, Binance, amongst many others.  
 
6. Conclusions 
The results presented in this study show that the origin and some characteristics of the model have remained constant 
over the years. However, the main difference that stands out in this comparison is that, although the article by Esmaeli 
and Hashemi mentions that a third configuration of the model can already be identified, it is in the years following 
this research that more information has become available that allows us to determine a third stage in the evolution of 
the model. 
 
This third stage demonstrates a change of focus for companies seeking to utilize their platforms as a center of 
commerce and betting on social interaction and web traffic. Technological disruptions such as those mentioned in the 
article will play a fundamental role in the future of social commerce, and it is because of this technological sensitivity 
and dynamism that a role of curiosity and constant research must be maintained concerning the model, since social 
commerce and technology can evolve faster than expected.

Abstract 
The following paper focuses on designing an innovative method for connecting 3D printed components. This is an 
important topic to weakness the problem of printer dimensions. The idea of connecting different parts in a larger one 
using compliant mechanism starts from a real application concerning the building of molds with dimensions beyond 
the desktop size for carbon fiber lamination. The goal is to maximize the mold quality without the need of excessively 
increase in printing time. These aspects provided an opportunity to delve into the topic of dividing 3d printed molds 
and the subsequent assembly, as well as disassembly for the extraction stages of the laminated part. The goal of the 
paper is to propose a mechanism capable of facilitating all stages of part production, from mold assembly to component 
extraction. In addition, the idea is to develop a mechanism that does not require the use of specific tools. 
Keywords 
3D printing, FDM, carbon fiber lamination, compliant mechanism, assembly, disassembly. 
1. Introduction
This research considers 3D printing technology as a possible tool in the manufacturing process of finished part. This 
assumption is of fundamental importance because it moves the focus from the finished product to the production of 
the component itself. Reference is often made to prototypes or finished products made by 3d printing, but it is 
especially in the production phase that significant advantages are observed such as: the lowering of material cost, the 
absence of hazardous dust or toxic residues, and the possibility of application to different materials. 
However, the research aims to overcome a major limitation related to the maximum size of the component that can be 
printed with a desktop device (about 300x300x300 mm). Practical solutions, especially non-reversible ones, vary from 
gluing to physical connections (example plugs). Reversibility was imposed as a condition since in the extraction phase 
of the laminated part from the mould, the possibility of opening the mold in two or more parts reduces time and 
difficulty as well as the possibility of part fracture. 
In the field of 3d printing, FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology best corresponds to the requirements and 
needs of the presented case study. 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of the study is to ensure an intuitive, solid and reliable yet easily reversible connection for large, finished 
components made in 3d printing. The 3D printing technology chosen is FDM since it offers the possibility of building 
compliant mechanism printed in place using the same material as the component to which it is applied, without 
affecting cost and processing time.   
2. Literature Review
Additive manufacturing processes, most known as 3D printing is a rapid prototyping and manufacturing technology, 
which allows to portray 3D structures at a reasonable high speed at a low cost (Barua et al. 2021), (Jones et al. 2021), 
(Wang et al. 2017), (Pyo et al. 2017), (Ge et al. 2020). These processes have proved to have exciting potential in

One of the advantages of the presented connection is its self-centering feature. Because of the elasticity of the key and 
the geometry of the cave, the load is oriented in a way that ensure a stable position even under ill conditioned loads. 
The solidity of the connection is good even with one key, but increases exponentially if more keys are arranged in 
parallel or orthogonally. The experience showed that the connector after repeated preloads, insertions and 
disconnections maintains its behavior and preload. If it is left inserted for long time, even over a month, it does not 
lose strength and can be reused. It is important to emphasize the retention of mechanical properties, as the reversibility 
of the connection was an essential requirement of the application.

6. Conclusion  
This study showed how 3D printing can be revolutionary not only for creating finished components, but also if 
integrated into the manufacturing process of other parts. In this case study, the design of a joint between 3D printed 
components with a compliant 3D printed mechanism was discussed. This solution proved to be though, stable, cheap

and modular. The combination of joints arrangements on the component could help customize parts for better 
efficiency, especially on different geometries. The presented mechanism was made using PLA material and FDM 
technology. A future development could be a further reduction in the number of linkage parts. This last step should 
be performed to adopt polymer’s 3D printing as replacement for classic mold materials.

Abstract 
 
The objective of simple assembly line balancing problem type1 is to minimize the number of workstations organized 
to perform tasks with precedence constraints. Assembly lines, which require a lot of manual labor, are an example of 
a manufacturing environment where learning effect influences the operation. In this case, when the minimal number 
of workstations is determined, the change of task times as a consequence of learning must be considered. This paper 
investigates the effects of two exponential learning curves on the minimal number of workstations when a simple 
assembly line balancing problem is solved. A modified simple assembly line balancing model incorporating the 
learning effect is formulated, and a sample problem to illustrate the application of the model is provided. Some general 
conclusions related to the type of learning curve function applied and to the change of learning rates are also presented. 
 
Keywords: 
Assembly line balancing, simple assembly line, learning curve, production management, mathematical programming. 
 
1. Introduction 
Learning is a process that all humans go through. The well-known exponential learning function (Wright 1936) 
formalized first this empirical evidence in manufacturing. The early applications studied how the number of units 
increases or the unit production costs decrease as the cumulative number of manufactured products increases. Since 
then, learning curves have been extensively used to represent the dynamics of various dependent variables (e.g., 
unitary costs, unitary task times, quality metrics) that are affected by experience and can be described in terms of 
autonomous ('learning by doing') or induced (e.g., training hours, investments, equipment) learning sources. Quality 
metrics (e.g., Lolli et al. 2016a; Ittner et al., 2001; Lolli et al. 2018), task times (e.g., Biskup 1999; Bailey 1989), and 
costs (e.g., Lolli et al.  2016b) are the most prevalent dependent variables utilized in learning curves in a variety of 
industrial and service operations. 
 
Assembly lines, which require a lot of manual labor, are an example of a manufacturing environment where learning 
effects are essential in determining task time. The goal of balancing an assembly line is to assign assembly tasks to 
workstations in order to maximize a specific performance measure while adhering to precedence constraints. The large 
variety of assembly line balancing problems (ALBP) are based on two basic models and named as type I and type II 
models. The type I ALBP (e.g., Li et al. 2017b; Gansterer and Hartl 2017) aims at minimizing the number of 
workstations required to meet a specific cycle time, whereas the type II ALBP (e.g., Tang et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017a) 
aims at minimizing the cycle time for a fixed number of workstations (Baybars, 1986). Furthermore, Boysen et al. 
(2007) divided ALBPs into three categories: single-model ALPBs, mixed-model ALPBs (where one product is created 
in different models on the same assembly line), and multi-model ALPBs (where multiple products are manufactured 
in batches). The nature of task times, either deterministic or stochastic, is another factor used to classify ALBPs. For 
a review of this topic, see Battaia and Dolgui (2013). ALBPs that use stochastic methods work effectively in labor-
intensive assembly lines where task times are assumed to be normally distributed. However, as a result of experience, 
the expected values of these task times decrease. That is to say, the lower the task times, the higher the quantity of 
assembled products. Because of the decreasing task times as a result of experience, the best balancing methods evolve 
with time. Our proposal fits under the deterministic type I ALBP with the learning effects research stream.

207","We can conclude that there are two distinct cases: 
• 
If the minimum number of WSs decreases before 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠 is reached in the Wright’s LC model, the minimum 
number of WSs, the allocated tasks and operators, and the station times will be identical to the results of the 
Plateau LC model.  
• 
However, If the minimum number of WSs decreases after 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠 in case of the Wright’s LC model, the allocated 
tasks, and operators and consequently the station times would be different in case of the Plateau LC model, 
and the decrease of the minimal number of WSs could be delayed or never be reached. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In simple assembly lines without the learning effect, the task times are constant, and consequently, so are the station 
times; therefore, when solving the SALBP-1 model, merely one solution is found.  In the presence of the learning 
effect, as tasks are repeated frequently, task times and station times decrease, causing the minimal number of 
workstations to drop along with the output units and the SALBP-1 has more than one solution. 
 
In this paper, a modified SALBP-1 model incorporating the learning effect is formulated and applied. The modified 
SALBP-1 model developed in section 4 is illustrated with a simple example in section 5. The Wright’s and the Plateau 
learning curves were chosen for our model because of their wide use. The model, however, can be valid for any other 
learning curves. 
 
In the illustrative example, two learning curves were chosen with four different learning rates: 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. 
The results showed that the minimal number of workstations at the start of production (𝑄𝑄=1 units) is the same as the 
basic SALBP-1 model (In our case, it was 4), which is logical since the learning effect has not started yet. However, 
for both LC models, the minimal number of WSs decreases along with the output unit due to the learning effect causing 
the allocation of tasks and operators and consequently the station times to change after each produced unit. 
 
Comparing the two learning curves, the results showed that if the decrease of the minimal number of workstations in 
the case of Wright’s LC model occurs before the plateauing quantity 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠, the results will be identical in the case of the 
Plateau LC model regardless of the learning rate. Nonetheless, if it happens after 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠, then the decrease of WSs in case 
of the Plateau LC model can be either delayed or never reached. 
 
In the present paper, the evolution of the minimal number of workstations in the presence of the learning effect is 
investigated. As a result, different task allocations and station number configurations were obtained during a 
production run. In practice, it is not practical and frequently not even feasible to change line configuration frequently 
during a production run. The solution for this problem is a unique line configuration that considers the evolution of 
task time in the early stages of operation when the decrease of task time is significant. How to obtain the optimal task 
allocation, which considers the change of task times as a consequence of learning, and also the stability requirement

Abstract 
Different organizations have started to provide automation in evaluating applicants during their interviews. Due to 
globalization, bilingualism has become essential in assessing individuals. Past studies have focused on analyzing the 
features and developing models for evaluating applicants who spoke only one language – English – during their 
interviews. Hence, this paper aims to analyze the lexical and prosodic features of interviews spoken using both English 
and Tagalog in evaluating interview performances based on three criteria: Leadership Ability, Communication Skills, 
and Candidate Enthusiasm. After consulting with domain experts, 60 mock interview recordings were gathered. The 
researchers used Google Cloud Services API for transcription and translation, PRAAT to extract prosodic features, 
and LIWC to extract lexical features. The researchers gathered different algorithms from past studies and selected the 
most suitable ones based on the characteristics of the datasets. From the results of model training, the researchers 
concluded that the optimal algorithms were LDA for Leadership Ability with 94% accuracy and 95% F1-score, SVM 
for Communication Skills with 88.89% accuracy and 82% F1-score, and Random Forest for Candidate Enthusiasm 
with 87.5% accuracy and 89.2% F1-score. Furthermore, the researchers concluded that words categorized under 
Psychological Processes were the most prevalent for lexical features, while features under Frequencies and Formants 
were the most prevalent for prosodic features.

1. Introduction
An interview is a methodical approach in assessing an individual’s capabilities (Huffcutt 2011). These capabilities 
vary based on what is being assessed (e.g., an individual’s agreeableness, interpersonal skills, and confidence). It is a 
conventional method done by various organizations to hire applicants based on what it needs. Organizations rely more 
on job interviews to hire applicants as this has been common in assessing applicants' skills, personality, and capability 
to handle the job position (Daisuke et al.  2019). 
Bilingualism has become essential in assessing individuals for employment. Ayada (2018) and Halai (2007) have 
stated that globalization has affected employment. As businesses and organizations start to shift to globalization, 
knowing two or more languages becomes one of the qualities employers are looking for in an individual. Another 
reason for this is the ability for bilingual individuals to express more information through the concept of code-
switching (Lipski 1978). 
Most of the conducted interviews in the mentioned studies are spoken in English; hence, this presents a gap because 
prosodic features of focus vary from one language to another (Lee 2015). Their models might not be effective when 
bilingual interviews are conducted. According to Ayada (2018) and Halai (2007), bilingualism is one of the qualities 
employers seek, as globalization affects the business industry. Thus, having a predictive model that can accommodate 
interview data of different languages would prove to be beneficial when it comes to automating how interview 
performances will be rated.

for the criteria Leadership Ability and Candidate Enthusiasm. On the other hand, the agreement level is Weak for the 
criterion Communication Skills. 
6. Conclusion
For the first specific objective of the study, the researchers conclude that the essential features pertain to psychological 
processes and frequencies and formants. For the lexical features of all criteria, the most common lexical category was 
psychological processes, with a percentage distribution of 62% - 68%. As for the prosodic features of all criteria, 
formants and frequencies are prevalent, with 25% for CS, 37.5% for LA, and 29.1% for CE. 
To measure the effect of translating Tagalog words into English to capture their lexemes for this study’s bilingual 
data, a separate dataset was created that treated Tagalog words as noise. It was trained to a separate set of models. The 
results were compared to the metrics of those models trained with the inclusion of translated Tagalog words. The 
models that treated Tagalog words as noise showed poor accuracy and F1-score values and poor overall generalization 
due to the significant differences in their training and testing results. Therefore, capturing the lexemes from Tagalog 
words through translation is essential for the models to avoid overfitting, have similar predictions on the study’s 
bilingual interview data, and have better generalization. 
For the second specific objective, the researchers conclude that removing momentary mistakes and personal 
information negatively affected the performance of the models. This suggests that features about momentary mistakes 
and personal information are relevant to the candidate's overall performance during an interview. 
For the third specific objective, the researchers conclude that the algorithms which provided the optimal results in 
predicting interview performance scores concerning this study’s datasets and their features were LDA (for Leadership 
Ability), SVM (for Communication Skills), and Random Forest (for Candidate Enthusiasm). The Prototype’s Kappa 
validity test results also show that using shorter interview recordings may result in predictions that exhibit weaker 
agreement levels. To further improve these models’ predictions over unseen data, better convergence between training 
and testing performances, and stronger agreement levels in Kappa validity tests, adding more interview samples 
(varying in duration and context) to the datasets is preferable for future attempts.

Abstract 
With growing competition for markets in the various production sectors, both in Brazil are looking for improvements 
in the world, as well as improvements that can improve their productivity and  reduce production costs and quality 
services. For this, among other strategic actions, continuous improvement can be sought as a means to remain 
competitive. In this context, the present work case, developed as a work study, has as its central objective the reduction 
of refuges generated by deficiencies in the production process in a metallurgical company that manufactures ductile 
iron pipes, among other products. From the application of the method and quality tools used, it was possible to identify 
the main causes of scrap, favoring its reduction through process improvements. With the identification and analysis 
of problems related to the training of manpower, lack of compliance with material specifications, inadequate or 
unfulfilled methods of production and making adjustments to machines used in production processes, it was possible 
to reduce the occurrence of defects in cast iron pipes, when compared to the amount of scrap counted before and after 
the changes implemented. The results achieved showed significant gains for the company by reducing the amount of 
scrap and rework generated during the production process. The reduction in the occurrence of defects favored a 
reduction of costs, contributing for the company to become more competitive.

1. Introduction
In the metallurgy sector, organizations seek ways to survive and remain competitive as a result of the current fierce 
competition for consumer markets. Under these conditions, companies in the sector have been seeking to produce with 
increasing cost reduction as a strategy to make their products more accessible by reducing prices to consumers 
(Brimacombe, 1989; Delange et al. 2005; Garbacz-Klempka et al. 2017).

Figure 1. Stages of the PDCA Cycle 
 
After monitoring the results and adjustments to the process, through training of the personnel involved, an 
improvement in the reduction of A30 scrap was observed. On week 20, the machine ran only one day and for only 5 
hours (55% of the programmed hours), due to an equipment shutdown for alignment of the tap changer. On this 
occasion 220 tubes were produced and 100 tubes were scrapped by A30, which represented 0.45% of production. If 
the machine had run fully, as scheduled, the expected production would have been 210.6 tons, and the scrap rate would 
have been 0.25%, below the initial 0.40%. 
 
5. Conclusion 
With the objective of contributing to make the company more competitive, it was sought, with the development of 
this work, the reduction of the scrap index called A30, in ductile iron pipe produced by a metallurgical industry, after 
analysis and identification that it was the most relevant defect to be studied at that moment. The quantitative survey 
of the defects in the produced pipes identified the anomalies in the period of three months of production. Since the 
types and quantities of defects found were numerous, we sought to establish the analysis of the most common ones. 
Thus, of the six defects identified in the produced tubes, defect A30 represented a total of 40% of those defects that 
caused scrap. 
 
To obtain the solution or reduction of the problem identified with the help of the Pareto Diagram, it was sought to 
observe and understand the way the process was being performed, as well as if the company's standards were being 
followed, generating potential causes that, using the 5 Whys tool associated with the Ishikawa Diagram, it was possible 
to reach the root causes. The identified causes were grouped into 6 categories (Labor, Material, Method, Machine, 
Measurement, and Environment) in the Ishikawa Diagram as a way to facilitate the analysis and its understanding. In 
function of the results obtained, it was observed that the most incident causes of the identified defect were caused by 
Method (33%) and Labor (25%) problems.  
 
Thus, based on the results of this study, the company was able to elaborate countermeasures to try to nullify the causes 
of the problems, as well as establish plans and goals and apply training to understand how the company's standards 
should be interpreted to guarantee that they are followed, with the objective of reducing the scrap rate resulting from 
defect A30, which before the beginning of the work was 40% of all problems or defects incident on the product. After 
the implementation of the MASP project, the scrap rate dropped from 40% to 28%, representing a reduction of 30% 
of the scrap caused by defect A30. This 12% saving in scrap ratifies an average saving of 3 thousand tons of cast iron 
per month, representing an annualized gain of more than 100 thousand Reais.

Abstract 
Supply chain agility (SCA) and resilience (SCR) have become a very important topic and have been widely discussed 
in various scientific forums, especially during the covid-19 outbreak that hit various countries in the world. The agility 
relates to how a logistics service provider quickly responds to short-term changes in the market due to uncertainties 
in upstream and downstream supply chains;  Supply chain complexity refers to level of numerousness, variety, 
variability, and uncertainty exhibited by the services, processes, and network of logistics service provider; Supply 
chain resilience constitute the capability of a supply chain to prevent disruptions and to reduce the impact of 
disruptions through developing required level of readiness, quick response and recovery ability. The study intends to 
verify the effect of supply chain agility (SCA) on supply chain resilience (SCR) moderated by supply chain complexity 
(SCC). The study has used a quantitative approach and survey cross sectional method. The research model is 
constructed by three variables namely supply chain agility (SCA) as independent or exogenous variable, supply chain 
complexity (SCC) as moderator variable, and supply chain resilience (SCR) as dependent or endogenous variable. 
Supply chain agility (SCA) has five indicators namely alertness, accessibility, decisiveness, swiftness, and flexibility. 
Supply chain complexity has three indicators namely product complexity, process flow complexity, and network 
complexity. Supply chain resilience has four indicators namely flexibility, redundancy, visibility, and collaboration. 
In collecting data, the study used electronic questionnaires (g-form), purposive sampling technique, and sample size 
100 logistics service companies in Indonesia. The study examined two hypotheses by using SEM-PLS (Smart-PLS). 
The research’s implications were further discussed both practically and theoretically.

Abstract 
One of blockchain functions in improving firm’s supply chain is adaptability. The ability of logistics service provider 
to adapt to current condition and seizing upon the opportunities being presented will be at the heart of each supply 
chain stakeholder’s success. In this research, supply chain adaptability relates to ability of logistics service provider 
in adapting to market change encompasses strategies, products, and technologies. Whereas supply chain resilience is 
capability of a supply chain of logistics service firms to prevent disruptions and to reduce the impact of disruptions 
through developing required level of readiness, quick response, and recovery. The research aims to examine the effect 
of supply chain adaptability on performance of logistics service firm through supply chain resilience. The study used 
quantitative and survey cross sectional method. The research model consists of three variables namely supply chain 
adaptability as independent or exogenous variable, supply chain resilience as mediator variable, and performance of 
logistics service firm as dependent or endogenous variable. Indicators of supply chain adaptability consist of quick 
response, shifting, resilient, digitalization; Indicators of supply chain resilience consist of flexibility, redundancy, 
visibility, and collaboration; Indicators of firm performance consist of finance, customer, internal process, and growth. 
The research used questionnaires or g-form and purposive sampling technique to collect data with sample size 100 
logistics service firms in Indonesia. The study tested four hypotheses by using SEM (Smart-PLS) both direct and 
indirect effect then discussion and implication were discussed further.

Abstract 
Many countries have implemented various policies to reduce carbon emissions. Among the policies available, cap-
and-trade regulations have well been accepted as an effective market-based mechanism to curb carbon emissions. This 
policy offers the opportunity for firms to share the benefits of low-emission in a carbon trading market by selling and 
purchasing credits. In this paper, we focus on the cap-and-trade emission reduction policy. Specifically, we study an 
emission-dependent supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a supplier and a retailer. In this supply chain, a cap on 
emission permits for the manufacturer is primarily imposed by the government and additional emissions must be 
purchased from the emission trading market if the permit needed is larger than the cap. We investigate the effects of 
the emission cap-and-trade on the supply chain members' decisions for decentralized and centralized supply chain 
using a Stackelberg game model. In the decentralized supply chain, a product's retail price is higher than in the 
centralized decision-making mode. Moreover, the price of extra emissions under the decentralized supply chain 
decrease as the carbon emissions cap increases. Our results show that in the centralized supply chain enterprises obtain 
higher benefits than in the decentralized supply chain. The outcome of this research can help i) policy-makers to make 
effective emission reduction policies and ii) manufacturers and retailers to make sustainable operations and supply 
chain decisions.

Abstract 
Increasing the demand for robot usage in different industries has considerably changed companies’ operation and 
management complexity. Meanwhile, automation is a further trend to satisfy the shortage of human resources and 
enhance productivity. Because of the popularity of 5G technology and industry 4.0, the linkage of devices becomes 
more stable to connect with multiple robots simultaneously to track their location precisely. Therefore, it can boost 
the development of Robot Operating Systems (ROS) and the popularity of robot applications across different 
industries. In the current situation, the company’s trend is to apply Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) in operation to 
increase the productivity and decrease human power involved. This technology is only suitable in a static environment 
to complete some assigned jobs with collision avoidance. AGV focuses much on repetitive work without any humans 
involved. The main weaknesses of AGV are not capable and flexible when applied in dynamic and unknown 
environments. However, Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) can work in these environments while it can help to 
achieve Human-Robot Interaction without collision avoidance. This research studies collision avoidance and 
trajectory tracking for multiple AMR. Adopting a path planning approach based on discrete optimization of path 
tracking is normally assumed in AMR in real-life scenarios. Dynamic path tracking should be investigated to solve 
the current issue of choosing the best path from a limited number of options while calculating vehicle acceleration and 
speed simultaneously. Meanwhile, the study provides a literature review to show the existing algorithm, navigation 
method, simulation method applied on AMR. Based on the above research, experimental results display more realistic 
data using a simulation modelling approach based on a real-life case study. The case study is set in different changes 
of the retail environment and different parameter changes of the robot to indicate how efficient the robot is, and which 
set of robots is suitable in an actual retail environment. Three case studies have been considered for multiple simulation 
scenarios, including a small convenience store, a medium-sized restaurant, and a supermarket. Gazebo software and 
Turtlebot 3 are used in the simulation. The service robot in a retail environment is evitable to conflict with humans 
while doing job tasks. The conflict resolution and human-machine cooperation are shown in simulation under complex 
task prioritization how the robot follows its own task-related goals while it has a conflict with humans. The results are 
shown with multiple parameters comparison, including the number of AMRs, different environment, types of 
algorithm and human involvement. The paper can conclude which method is suitably applied in multiple AMRs to 
achieve collision avoidance, trajectory tracking, and human-robot interaction. The findings and recommendations 
presented in this study can further assist with ROS effectively by implementing AMR into real-world scenarios.

Abstract 
We address a no-wait flow shop scheduling problem where the setup times are treated as separate and uncertain. The 
objective is to minimize maximum lateness which is one of the most essential performance measures for customer 
satisfaction and loss of goodwill. The considered problem is common in manufacturing environments like metal, food 
and pharmaceutical industries where some of the operations must not be interrupted. In many cases, setup time, the 
time required to set up a resource, is either ignored or assumed to be constant. However, these assumptions might lead 
to inefficient planning. Therefore, we relax these assumptions and consider uncertain but bounded setup times. The 
problem has been addressed in the scheduling literature where dominance relations were presented. In the current 
paper, we propose new dominance relations and show that the newly proposed dominance relations are around 100% 
more efficient than the existing. One of the main strengths of the newly proposed dominance relations is that their 
performances get better as the uncertainty in setup time increases. These dominance relations can also be used for 
initial sequence generation or improving the final solution as well as finding the optimal solutions for small size 
problems. Moreover, we also propose new and efficient heuristics as potential solutions for the problem and also for 
similar problems. Based on extensive computational experiments, we show that our new heuristics are around 90% 
more efficient than the existing ones in the literature under the same computational time.

Abstract 
Magetan leather shoes are one of the leather industries in Indonesia that produce quality and durable products. One of 
the stations in Magetan leather shoes, namely the upper sole assembly station, shows a hunched posture of workers 
and the operator's hands hanging. This project aims to assist the operator of the upper sole assembly station to adjust 
its position with the design of work facility. The design of work facilities begins with distributing Nordic Body Map 
(NBM) and Quick Exposure Check (QEC) questionnaires to operators, Calculation of Quick Entire Body Assessment 
(REBA), Anthropometry and using NIDA (Need, Idea, Decision, Action) Method. As a result, based on the results of 
the NBM, there are complaints of musculoskeletal disorders in the back as the most complaints. Then, at QEC it was 
found that further research is needed and implement changes. In the REBA method, a score of 8 is obtained, which 
means high risk, investigate, and implement changes. Because of these problems, a work desk and chair are designed 
using NIDA method and Best-Worst Method. An alternative comparison was made on the design materials of work 
desks and chairs, namely aluminum, wood, and iron to obtain the best criteria as materials for making work desks and 
chairs. The criteria considered in each alternative are strength, price, availability, durability, and aesthetics. By using 
the Best-Worst Method, aluminum is obtained as the best alternative material that best meets the criteria as a material 
for making work desks and chairs.

Abstract 
This research focuses on the leather shoes' semi-finished product storage facility designing in the rural small industry, 
Magetan, East Java, Indonesia. The workstation of this industry needs to be improved, due to the lack of storage space 
for the semi-finished product of leather shoes. Besides limited space, the material arrangement was also unstructured. 
This condition impacted the process inefficiency, among others the production operator take more time for searching 
the semi-finished material to process become finished leather shoes. Therefore, this research resolves that problem by 
designing a storage facility using the Value Engineering method. Using this method, the SIMILAR stages on the 
system and process design were utilized to generate several alternative facility design solutions. A systematic analysis 
was conducted for two design facility alternatives, with criteria achieving the desired function, fulfilling the industry 
requirement such as appearance, quality, ease of maintenance, and acceptable cost. Alternative 1 of the semi-finished 
product storage facility was chosen, with the circle shape design using Aluminium material, installed underside wheels 
to easily moved, and the storage facility could be rotated. This design was expected could support the industry to 
produce leather shoes more efficiently.

Results and Discussion 
The results of the analysis showed that the proposed alternative 1 is the best alternative. This is supported by the 
functions and costs that can be achieved by the proposed alternative. Based on the function analysis, alternative 
proposal 1 fulfills the objective function to be achieved, which can be used as a storage place for semi-finished 
products. Based on the cost analysis, the production cost incurred for alternative 1 is cheaper than the proposal 2. 
Proposal 1 has a production cost of Rp659,000 while alternative 2 is Rp1,432,000. 
The development stage and recommendations were obtained from feedback from the owner of the Magetan leather 
shoe industry. The owner gave suggestions that the proposed alternative should pay attention to the size to be made 
so that it is not too big because the Magetan leather shoe production site is also a place to live for the owner of the 
company. Information regarding the used of semi-finished product storage areas based on product type and size will 
be listed in each pole branch in alternative 1 where an aluminum plate will be given with the shoe size written on and 
colored to distinguish each type of shoe. 
This project has both positive and negative risks from the planned implementation of the results. 
a. Positive risks
The Magetan Leather Shoe IKM will find solutions to problems related to storage of semi-finished products. The
product will not be trampled and will not mix with each other between the types and sizes of shoes that have been
made, then the product can be stored easily and does not require a lot of space and the product can be moved easily.
b. Negative risks
The Magetan Leather Shoe IKM needs to pay special costs in the manufacture of this product and if there is already
a product, the worker must use the right tool and need additional space so that the tool can be used optimally.
3. Conclusion
The semi-finished product is made up of numerous shoe patterns that have been cut and assembled before being given 
soles and other finishing touches to make a finished shoe. The workstation in leather shoe industry needs to be 
improved, due to the lack of storage space for the semi-finished product of leather shoes. Besides limited space, the 
material arrangement was also unstructured. This condition impacted the process inefficiency. A systematic analysis 
was conducted for two design facility alternatives, with criteria achieving the desired function, fulfilling the industry 
requirement such as appearance, quality, ease of maintenance, and acceptable cost. Alternative 1 of the semi-finished 
product storage facility was chosen, with the circle shape design using Aluminium material, installed underside wheels 
to easily moved, and the storage facility could be rotated. This design was expected could support the industry to 
produce leather shoes more efficiently.

Abstract 
This document exposes a technological tool to support the learning of Phonological Awareness skills, built under the 
guidelines proposed by Jiménez and Ortíz and aims to train high school children in the acquisition of this 
metalinguistic skill through a variety of activities (syllabic, intrasyllabic, and phonemic awareness) and immediate 
feedback, to acquire an excellent reading-writing process. The tool obtained is an application for the Android operating 
system that is easy to install, learn and configure by the therapist. For the construction of the software prototype, we 
have chosen to follow a methodology based on: i) the ADDIE instructional model (Analysis-Design-Develop-
Implement-Evaluate), ii) the agile development methodology SCRUM, iii) the Methodological Guide for the creation 
of developments accessible virtual curricula; and iv) the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM); with the contribution 
of a multidisciplinary team made up of experts in information and communication technologies, linguistic 
rehabilitation, education, and graphic design. During the five phases of the methodology, the users’ requirements were 
considered.

1. Introduction
More than 617 million children and adolescents are not reaching minimum proficiency levels (MCLs) in reading, 
according to new estimates from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). The latest data points to a significant loss 
of human potential that could threaten progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The total rate of 
children and adolescents who do not read competently in Latin America and the Caribbean is 36% (UNESCO Statistic 
Institute, 2017). 
These reading difficulties are presented as dyslexia, whose prevalence is estimated between 5-10%, even reaching 
15%, a situation that can cause difficulties in the child's academic and personal development. Therefore, prevention, 
early detection, and timely intervention are essential (Tamayo Lorenzo  2017). Dyslexia can be presented by a 
phonological deficit that causes difficulties in segmentation, repetition of pseudowords1 and infrequent letter 
1 Grouping of letters that do not constitute a word, therefore, they do not allow to represent an idea or concept

As explained Pelosi et al. (2018), computer-based play games can support activities related to phonological learning. 
In this sense, the software prototype implements several CF exercises; one of them is phoneme segmentation, 
considered one of the most challenging skills to acquire for school-age children; previous studies have determined 
that first-grade students obtain the lowest scores in this skill (Kartal and Terziyan, 2016). The applied methodology 
included five key aspects: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Validation, which facilitated 
obtaining a software prototype to support the development of CF. 
Most of the responses to the open-ended questions in the questionnaire were optimistic about using the software 
prototype in the future. Following this criterion, hypotheses H41 and H51 were confirmed in the execution of the 
quasi-experiment. There is an awareness that other factors can affect users' decisions when testing software. However, 
those are factors that cannot be controlled. The objective of this work was to select the most critical factors regarding 
use, such as perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (Cedillo Orellana, 2017).

Abstract 
This project elaborated and executed a strategic communication plan for the “DYAC” platform in Cuenca for 2021 to 
generate knowledge and create more user flow and researchers in this platform. There was an analysis of theoretical 
documents about concepts of communication, elements, types with an emphasis on business communication and 
related topics such as internal and external communication and conceptualization of the stages for the development of 
a great communication plan. To achieve this purpose a mixed methodology was used, the information obtained from 
the interviews, focus groups and surveys researchers from the different universities of Cuenca and fellow students 
from Universidad del Azuay. The execution of the plan design was satisfactory, the strategies applied have achieved 
a greater reach in social networks and in the platform.

1. Introduction
Scientific documentation and archive (DYAC) is a website of the Universidad del Azuay that aims to preserve and 
archive research inventories of different disciplines, which researchers and users can use for academic purposes. The 
corpora uploaded in the application could be used by others - researchers and users - to carry out new studies. Since 
it is a new website, it is necessary to make it known; for this reason, we have thought of designing a strategic 
communication plan to disseminate it within our community and region (Cedillo S. et al, 2021). 
The strategic communication plan aims to generate awareness of DYAC, making a selection of appropriate mass 
media.  Also, to strengthen its image, create valuable content that will be published on the selected social networks.  
The information to know the aspects, factors, and mass media necessary for the creation and dissemination of 
announcements and publications in general, was obtained through quantitative and qualitative research with the use

develop the strategic communication plan, considering the mass media, publications, and time allocated for each 
activity.’ 
The survey also revealed that the correct term for DYAC is platform and does not apply because the public identifies 
more with it.  It was evidenced that the application is more associated with a cell phone app.  
Another important aspect is that most users, especially the university community, are willing to use the DYAC 
platform because they consider that the content of research products would be archived in a secure platform, with the 
possibility of sharing them with other researchers.  However, they are not willing to pay for its use. For that reason, it 
is important to keep it an easily accessible and free website.  
Likewise, the teachers and researchers who would be willing to be part of DYAC, upload all their records, the only 
condition they have requested is that our copyrights be respected and recognized. This condition has been considered 
and explained on the platform.  
As for the communication plan for DYAC, this focused on disseminating the existence of the platform through social 
networks that are identified as mass media and interaction in this case Facebook and Instagram, and acceptance by 
users was evidenced. The aforementioned social networks were an indispensable channel to generate awareness and 
redirection to the DYAC platform, thus obtaining user traffic and researcher registrations, despite the limited time of 
the implementation of the communication plan.  
In addition, the effectiveness and efficiency of the strategies proposed were demonstrated, because when analyzing 
the marketing metrics with the data achieved by the organic and paid publications in the corresponding networks, the 
reach, interactions, impressions, and activity in the redirection to the DYAC platform, are within the cost range of 
actions per user. However, it was observed that there is more traffic and user activity on Facebook than on Instagram. 
One of the major limitations of this study was time since it had to adjust to a very tight schedule.  Therefore, the 
possibility of continuing to apply the selected strategies for the dissemination of the DYAC platform over a longer 
period of time remains open. This opens up other lines of research such as measurements and corrections to the plan 
proposed in this research.

Abstract 
Over the past decade, the applications of drone technology have proliferated in various industries. This dissertation 
sets out to investigate the opportunities and challenges of drones in manufacturing industries from an operations 
management (OM) perspective. This dissertation consists of four papers. The first paper explores the applications of 
drones in manufacturing and proposes a typology of drone applications. The second paper narrows down the scope 
to examine potential applications and the benefits and challenges involved in the petrochemical industry that has 
shown particularly high potentials for the use of drones. The third paper focuses on the adoption process of drones in 
Geberit and IKEA and highlights where, why, and how drones can be used in operations settings. The fourth paper 
builds a virtual simulation model and explores the potential of automatic drones in factory inspection operations. 
This dissertation contributes to the existing literature on advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT) by 
introducing the new case of drones. This dissertation has rich contributions to practice. First, it provides a systematic 
approach to identifying drone applications, benefits, and challenges in manufacturing settings and provides a useful 
starting point for companies evaluating the adoption of drone technology in their factories by elucidating the factors 
that should be known and planned before implementation. This dissertation benefits from both explorative and 
experimental research approaches. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this dissertation offers one of the first 
systematic and rigorous analyses on drone technology from an OM perspective. 
Keywords 
Drones, Operations Management, Technology Management, Industry 4.0, and Manufacturing. 
1. Introduction
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)—popularly known as drones—have a long history of development, primarily for 
military applications. Over the last two decades, breakthrough advances in drone technology (Floreano and Wood, 
2015), as well as in components, and other technologies used in drones, have enabled transforming drone technology 
from a military tool to a commercial product. Despite their great potentials, the adoption rate of drones in 
manufacturing industries has been rather limited.  
At the start of this doctoral research in 2016, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the only application of drones in 
the manufacturing industry was concerned with inspection and monitoring in outdoor environments of oil, gas, and 
petrochemical plants, particularly for the inspection of flaring stacks (sUAS News, 2014). Yet, consulting and 
financial service companies and investment banks released optimistic estimates in 2016 for the future of drone 
technology as an industrial tool (e.g., Allianz, 2016; Goldman Sachs, 2016; Mazur and Wiśniewski, 2016). Drones 
also explicitly appeared for the first time in Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies in 2016, which 
mapped drones at the early phase of the peak of inflated expectations (Forni and Meulen, 2016) (see Figure 1).

data transfer and compatibility with infrastructure. The main organizational challenges include training pilots, 
developing know-how and organizational routines for drone flights. The legislative challenges mainly address 
privacy regulations. Finally, the societal and mental challenges are concerned with trusting drone flights in terms of 
reliability and safety and managing likely anxieties and pressures on personnel.  
 
3.5 Contribution 5 
Using emerging technologies in process industries has scarcely been the subject of research in OM scholarship. In 
this dissertation, the potential of drones has been studied in a specific category of process industries—the 
petrochemical industry. “While the process industry realizes a considerable portion of GDP in many countries, 
operations management (OM) research has traditionally paid very little attention to this large group of industries” 
(Donk and Fransoo, 2006, p. 211). This dissertation contributes to this deficiency in OM scholarship by highlighting 
the management of emerging technologies such as drones in process industries.  
 
3.6 Contribution 6 
Evidence shows that using drones indoors poses more technological (e.g., navigation), operational (e.g., noise), and 
organizational (e.g., investment justification) challenges than doing so outdoors. In this dissertation, to study the 
potential of drones in indoor settings, a research project was established with Geberit and IKEA to present case 
evidence of opportunities and hurdles in adopting drones in operations settings.  
 
3.7 Contribution 7 
The development of automatic drone technology can be a game changer for the applicability of drones in indoor 
manufacturing. This dissertation contributes to the assessment of using automatic drones in factory inspection 
operations through a virtual simulation method. Virtual simulation models enable playing with automatic drones, 
defining and evaluating different trade-off scenarios, and investigating the hurdles of using automatic drones in 
indoor settings. 
 
3.8 Contribution 8 
Operations managers have long been engaging in technology management. However, in the era of “Industry 4.0,” 
they are now being asked to explore, assess, pilot, and scale fast-changing and potentially disruptive technologies 
before certainty in the business case. Given the ambiguous nature of this managerial challenge, this dissertation 
contributes theoretical and practical insights. Although the classic technology adoption models of the AMT literature 
would generally suggest that drones should not have been piloted as often as they are, this dissertation shows that 
hyped “Industry 4.0” technologies like drones—supported by a thriving vendor ecosystem—are developing into 
viable business cases through piloting of use cases. This dissertation also provides cautionary points for TM 
researchers to be sensitive to the technologies’ development stage. 
 
3.9 Contribution 9 
Studying emerging technologies needs to bridge insights from the developer and the user perspectives in order to 
align the developments with real needs. Combining insights from both drone technology developers and drone users 
is a crucial step for an early analysis on an emerging technology, which avoids providing one-sided, either overly 
optimistic or pessimistic results on technological capabilities and unrealistic application areas. 
 
4. Conclusion 
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this dissertation presents the first academic analysis of potential drone 
applications in manufacturing from an OM perspective. This dissertation has analyzed the potentials of drone 
applications in manufacturing industries as constituting an AMT. The results show that drone technology has quite 
distinct characteristics and that drone adoption processes exhibit relatively new opportunities and challenges 
compared with other AMTs. This research has focused primarily on the capabilities of drones and the applications 
areas in manufacturing industries, as well as on the benefits and the hurdles involved. Next, it has narrowed down 
the scope to a specific manufacturing industry and then to applications in operations settings.

Abstract 
The objective of this research was to propose a methodology for the evaluation of the value chain of the sector 
dedicated to the manufacture of chemical substances and products. To carry it out, a systematic literature review was 
carried out, whose conceptual basis was Porter's value chain model. It was found that this model is applicable in 
different sectors, thus allowing this evaluation to be carried out in the sector in question. The proposed tool, of a 
qualitative nature, evaluates both primary and support activities that make up the generic value chain. In addition, a 
series of questions related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in this sector is proposed. It is concluded that the 
value chain represents a powerful evaluation tool, with the capacity for flexibility and adaptation to the contexts and 
business sectors to be evaluated.

1. Introduction
Since the middle of the 20th century, the entry of different economic actors caused an increase in competitiveness in 
international markets, for which the creation and conservation of value became a crucial topic of analysis in the 
business world. In fact, the period of recovery and reconstruction of the countries involved in the Second World War 
was configured as the ideal setting for the emergence of many businesses that were dedicated to meeting the changing 
needs of society. In this line, the companies understood that it was unavoidable to adjust their business models, so that 
they adapted them to the demands of the environment (Ramírez et al. 2021). Among the business groups that had to 
combine their actions in the market, there were those dedicated to the production of chemical substances.  
That statement is consistent when it is recognized that it is difficult to conceive any routine, recreational or productive 
activity in which said substances do not intervene (Yarto et al. 2007). In this regard, Cortinas de Nava (2009) suggests 
that a large part of these types of elements have been the basis for the progress of various production processes, so 
they can also be considered an essential factor when generating business, income and employment. To corroborate 
this, GQSP Colombia (2020) explain that the chemical industry is heterogeneous and diverse, with limits that are 
difficult to establish in comparison with other sectors, and with the capacity to supply many of them. Montes-Valencia 
(2015) states that, although this industry has contributed to improving people's quality of life, it is also the cause of 
contamination in the soil, water and air. Faced with this reality, it highlights the role played by Green Chemistry as an 
alternative solution to obtain the sustainability of the planet and it is based on 12 principles (Vargas and Ruiz 2007), 
which have been adopted in the production of many products (Scandurra et al. 2004). 
1.1 Objective 
The objective of this research was to propose a methodology for the evaluation of the value chain of the sector 
dedicated to the manufacture of chemical substances and products, so that a comprehensive evaluation of the activities 
of the companies aimed at to generate greater added value, as well as to achieve their sustainability in the market.

and an experiential analysis. They point out the need to properly guide the value chain concept according to the 
business contexts in which it is intended to be applied. Thus, the tool proposed by the current study also constitutes 
an effort to measure the value chain proposed by Porter, which enjoys flexibility and adaptation to different realities 
of the chemical sector. For their part, Guzmán-Bautista and Chire-Fajardo (2018), based their study on the analysis of 
the value chain and the analysis of the competitive diamond proposed by Porter. Its objective was to determine the 
existing deficiencies in the value chain of Peruvian cocoa to subsequently propose comprehensive improvement 
proposals using competitive factors. With this, the authors were able to obtain a photograph of the groups participating 
in the value chain of the product in question. In this regard, this research is also aligned with Porter's models and aims 
to provide entrepreneurs that 'photograph' that reflects the current situation of their value chain, to carry out 
improvement actions. In turn, Moreno-Miranda et al. (2020), evaluated the sustainability of cocoa agri-food chains in 
public-private agendas in Ecuador.  
 
To achieve this, under a qualitative and quantitative approach, they examined socioeconomic, agronomic, and 
environmental aspects through a mapping of the value chain and the identification of its actors. The results 
demonstrated the feasibility of applying strategies in the value chain in the long term, whose main contribution lay in 
a comprehensive analysis capable of monitoring the adoption of sustainable models. Thus, the methodology of this 
last study is aligned to the one which was carried out in this research and manages to highlight its contribution to the 
improvement of the management of primary and support activities of a value chain. In the same line of ideas, Pittaluga 
and Pirrocco (2021), contributed to the development of tools aimed at identifying opportunities in the country in 
strategic value chains for the chemical sector. They carried out a systematization of qualitative and quantitative 
information on the sector in question. The results made it possible to obtain a tool with the capacity of identifying 
opportunities in the face of threats, using the strengths of the sector of interest for this purpose. Again, the purpose 
pursued by said study is aligned with the one of this research, since the developed tool seeks to facilitate the process 
of identifying strengths and weaknesses, making the latter be mitigated and using the positive aspects to take advantage 
of opportunities that arise in the market. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The high levels of uncertainty and volatility of the environment in which companies operate today, have turned value 
into a necessary element, but not optional, to survive in the market. To achieve this, the value chain is presented as 
the appropriate tool for this, since it has the capacity to carry out a comprehensive business examination, taking into 
consideration all those economic-productive activities that are carried out, as well as the interests of the stakeholders. 
Thus, its careful examination allows obtaining an overview of business performance, quickly identifying strengths to 
be exploited, as well as weaknesses to be corrected; all this, framed within a context of improving competitiveness, 
management, growth and sustainability. On the other hand, the importance of making efforts aimed at evaluating the 
value chain must be established, considering it as a key management model that should not be neglected. Thus, the 
tools built for this purpose, whether of a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed nature, constitute valuable contributions to 
be considered by businessmen, according to their convenience and purpose of analysis. Likewise, this work aims to 
highlight the importance of CSR evaluation as a complementary and unavoidable element of the value chain, given 
the importance and the dynamic and transversal role of the environmental field that it plays today with all interest 
groups. In addition, the inclusion of this theme demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the value chain model, 
thus showing that it can be adjusted to any economic-sectoral reality. It is recommended that, for future research, 
quantitative evaluation tools, such as dynamic modeling, be built so that continuous evaluation and control can be 
carried out. Likewise, it is recommended to work from the academy in the construction of this type of tools that help 
in a substantial way to improve the business management of different economic sectors.

Abstract 
In the context of Industry 4.0, companies must offer the market personalized systems (from goods to services). This 
customization is mainly supported by specific tools, called Configurators, which are based on a generic model 
formalizing the catalog and diversity proposed by a company, on a family of systems.  The generic model or GM 
formalizes all the items (systems, subsystems, components, services, sub-modules, etc.) needed to build a system, in 
terms of nomenclature, compatibility (which items can be connected or associated to others) and options, which can 
be added to meet specific needs. Companies typically offer several variations of families of systems, all based on a 
common nomenclature. For example, a bicycle manufacturer will be able to offer its customers basic bicycles, road 
bikes, mountain bikes, children's bikes, women's bikes, etc. Two policies for formalizing knowledge in the form of 
GMs can thus emerge: 1) the GM formalizes all the knowledge and diversity proposed for all families of systems, 2) 
the GM formalizes only the knowledge and diversity specific to a family of systems; in this case, several GMs ranging 
from the most generic to the most specialized family cover the proposed diversity. It is thus possible to derive from a 
generic GM, the other more specific GMs. This specialization of generic models (from a basic bike to a competition 
road bike for children) can be achieved via a specialization mechanism between models. In this communication, we 
focus on this modeling problem by studying the complexity of the different models according to the chosen modeling 
policy. This complexity could be measured using the density of the model, its maximum degree, its number of vertices, 
etc.

Abstract 
Business plans become an important preliminary step for all Start Up. Properly defining the market segment and 
penetration, growth and operation strategies are activities that become essential. The objective of this work is to 
identify the necessary strategies that allowed a product called UDA-ERP to go from research to a business model. For 
this, a market study was applied by means of surveys to a group of micro and small companies in Cuenca, the third 
most important city in Ecuador. With the application of various strategic analysis tools, macro-strategies were 
determined that made it possible to establish a sustainable business model for a product resulting from an academic 
research project.

1. Introduction
Technology is constantly evolving at a dizzying pace, which becomes even more evident in the so- called “intelligent 
society” (Deguchi et al. 2018), an aspect that directly affects one of the axes that influence business growth and the 
generation of value in business. The wide range of computer systems in this globalized market has exponentially 
marked a trend in recent years, and business leaders, who embrace information technology (IT) as a strategic pillar, 
seek to strengthen them making their business processes more efficient (Deguchi et al.  2018). One of the technological 
tools commonly adopted and used by organizations is the enterprise resource planning - ERP.  
UDA-ERP is a computer system aimed at meeting the management requirements of the business resources of MSMEs. 
This software has had an important development path since 2015 as a part of a research project by a group of professors 
from Universidad del Azuay (Astudillo-Rodríguez et al.  2020). In the software market context, it is unattainable for 
a MSME to access a business tool such as an ERP, due to its high costs which include licensing, conceptualization, 
installation, training, and maintenance services, easily exceeding 50,000 dollars, triggering that only large companies 
can implement it. In this research, UDA-ERP viability, and sustainability to supply different market segments was 
analyzed, considering the natural characteristics in which a MSME operates and the resources it must face it. To 
propose macro strategies oriented to their life cycle in launch and growth stages, a market study was applied to MSMEs 
in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador, to answer the following research questions:    
●
q1. What are the market characteristics that must be considered for UDA-ERP to be self-sustaining?
●
q2. What are the business strategies that should be considered for the product life cycle?
●
q3. What aspects are MSME segments looking for in a business software solution?

information technologies reflects a wide range of prices in the market. Therefore, the UDA-ERP system should set 
prices according to the size of the company, the type of installation requested and, of course, add consulting and 
maintenance services to the price. 
5 
Promotion 
Strategy 
The promotion strategy includes having a website where the features of the ERP software are displayed, detailing 
each of its modules, benefits, plans, success cases. Social networks play a very important role, because today they 
use artificial intelligence where advertising is targeted according to user behavior, for this case advertising through 
the most popular platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube is key to significant growth. For the social 
environment ""word of mouth"" advertising is handled, it is here where the users of the UDA-ERP system will 
disclose their experience with the acquisition of the system. It is important to consider that this commonly used 
mechanism generates at least 3 positive comments, but also at least 20 negative comments, the approach to focus 
on the UE (User Experience). 
6 
Distribution 
strategy 
A distribution channel should be designed to retain current customers and obtain new ones. In the case of working 
with a software distribution company, the need to maintain the existing product-customer link should also be 
considered. 
5.2 Business models 
Three business models were determined, which are: i) percentage share of business profit; ii) free software and paid 
consulting services; and iii) software leasing on a pay-per-subscription basis. The financial analysis proposed for three 
scenarios shows the possibilities in which the UDA-ERP system can be developed, but the most important is the 
profitable response presented by the realistic scenario and the projection of positive sales from the fourth year onwards 
for a 10-year term. The UDA-ERP product has acquired enough potential to launch commercially and meet the needs 
of its target market. Its vision has made companies that never imagined having access to an ERP system, turn towards 
a new panorama where they can acquire this system at an accessible and reasonable price. The benefits provided by 
the implementation of an ERP have led companies to invest in it and the results are practically immediate if its 
management and control is correct. These results are reflected in improved process efficiency and increased 
productivity. Searching for sustainable business models is the fundamental basis for moving forward with a business 
idea, understanding the needs that are explicit and implicit in daily life and having the ingenuity and will to transform 
those needs into an opportunity to generate a significant contribution to society. The proposed strategies for the 
commercial launch of this system must be carried out with initiative and creativity, always seeking to stand out and 
highlight the strengths that have been built up over the years.  
More continuous work must be done about advertising; this aspect is the next stage for this product to be positioned 
in the market and to achieve not only a realistic scenario but also an optimistic one. Pricing is another issue that must 
be managed through continuous analysis. Ecuador does not have an entity that regulates prices within the software 
industry, therefore, it is necessary to maintain a price that can be accessible to customers, but it is also necessary to 
avoid entering a price war with the competition and that this could harm the profitability of the company. At this point 
it is necessary that the quality of the service offered is adequate and meets customer expectations. 
6. Conclusion
In response to the research question ""What are the market characteristics that must be considered for the UDA-ERP 
to be self-sustainable?"", it can be said that the Ecuadorian market responds to 98% of companies in the MSME sector, 
which during the pandemic caused by Covid-19 suffered several economic problems, since during the year 2020 there 
was a reduction in sales, generating a negative impact with the closure of many of them. To this reality, during the 
government of President Lenin Moreno, a 2% tax was applied on the income from sales, affecting the profit of small 
businesses that usually range between 10% and 20% of the profit, an aspect that was negative for the business model 
of the startup UDA-ERP. Under this perspective, the best scenario for the sustainability of the project is to lease the 
software through a monthly subscription payment, as opposed to the models that pursued a percentage of the net 
business profit or free software with paid consulting services, the latter being the least profitable for the Start up. 
In response to question 2, ""What are the commercial strategies to be considered for the product's life cycle?"", it can 
be stated that the commercial strategies should be considered according to the product's life cycle and evolution in the 
market. The BCG matrix resulted in a strategic decision which consists of taking advantage of the available resources 
to make a representative investment to achieve a firm position in the market and transform the product into a ""Dairy 
Cow"" product. The first strategy is the penetration of the product in the market, which should be initiated with the 
concept of brand pre-activation. This is undoubtedly the stage in which the greatest advertising effort is made since it 
consists of attracting the interest of the target market. Another important strategy for the introduction and expansion 
of the product is the generation of linkage spaces with institutions and management organizations that gather industrial 
and commercial sectors. In addition, it should be emphasized the difference that UDA-ERP maintains with other ERP

systems in the market, whose competitive advantage is the low subscription cost of the complete package, an aspect 
that is notably advantageous compared to the products of the competition. Finally, considering question 3 ""What 
aspects are the MSME segment looking for in a business software solution?"", it can be argued that these aspects can 
be summarized in a software that is easy to manage, low cost and accessible from anywhere. These aspects invite to 
study the corporate customer's behavior in terms of decisions and perceptions of use, a topic that will be analyzed in 
a study of technology acceptance models (TAM) in enterprise applications, specifically those of enterprise resource 
management.

Abstract 
 
In this decade, manufacturing companies are facing events that disrupt delicate balances and experiencing tangible 
challenges that cannot be deferred. Among these, the acceleration of technological transformation to follow the 
introduction of Industry 4.0, the difficulty in sourcing raw materials and accessing different markets due first to the 
COVID 19 pandemic and more recently to geopolitical tensions and conflicts. In this scenario, traditional supply chain 
models need to transform into digital supply chains (DSCs), where functional silos are broken down to enable end-to-
end visibility, agility, collaboration, and resilience to such shocks. The literature on the subject is still immature and 
many concepts are still vague and undefined. In this regard, this article aims to answer the following questions: (i) 
What are the main research areas within the topic? (ii) What is the development trajectory of the topic? (iii) What are 
the main digital technologies that can support DSC capabilities? (iv) What can be its research agenda? For this purpose, 
this paper aims at reviewing the existing scientific production on DSCs, combining a systematic review with 
bibliometric tools. The resulting framework can serve as a preliminary guide for companies facing the challenges 
listed above and can open up future research that can validate the results empirically.

1. Introduction and background 
The phenomenon of digital transformation is disrupting all types of supply chains (SCs), also encouraged by the 
improvement of digital technologies and the spread of the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Queiroz et al. 2019). Although it 
originated in the manufacturing world, due to its importance and implications on SC processes and activities, the 
implementation of digital technologies is spreading in the SC world, giving rise to the term Digital Supply Chain 
(DSC) (Azevedo et al. 2022).  
The concept of DSC has been the subject of numerous studies in the scientific literature over time, however it is still 
developing (Kayikci  2018) and there are several definitions of the concept of DSC (Hanaysha, and Alzoubi 2022).

Abstract 
Invasive plant species can change an ecosystem’s food web by destroying or replacing native food sources, 
providing little to no food value for wildlife. They are also able to alter the abundance of diversity of species that are 
important habitats for native wildlife. Some aggressive species are even capable of changing ecosystem conditions, 
from soil chemistry to the intensity of wildfires. This project uses several algorithms to understand the factors that 
contribute to the spread of invasive species. Our model uses three different algorithms: One-Way Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA), Linear Regression (LR) as well as Nonlinear Regression (NR) to examine the characteristics of 
the ecological profile of current invasive species, specifically its spread and length in time it has had to spread. 
Based on statistical profiling of 77,075 records of 75 invasive species, over 10% of the species have matched the 
profile of known invasive plants, which are likely to become the next global invaders. These results present an 
opportunity to implement timely and proactive management strategies against biological invasions.

1. Introduction
The regions under study were Eastern and Southern Africa, whose ecosystems, while officially protected, are 
currently exposed to invasion by invasive plant species (Obiri  2011). In Eastern and Southern Africa, the spread of 
invasive species is impacting the livelihoods of the rural poor who are dependent on natural resources for income 
and survival, as well as undermining foreign development investment in the area. Given that their dependency on 
natural resources has increased more significantly over the last decade (Shackleton et al.  2000, and Witt et al. 
2010), efforts to understand the root causes of the growth and spread of invasive species are needed to be proactive 
about their current and future survival. However, there has been a limited study on what promotes or prevents the 
growth of these invasive species in those regions. Therefore, using a set of algorithms, this study investigates how 
time and the type of the invasive species control their behavior. 
Three different machine learning algorithms, one-way ANOVA, Linear Regression (LR), and Nonlinear Regression 
(NR) will be performed in order to uncover the nature of the impact that the types of the invasive species and time 
have on the size of their spread. 
Minimal studies have attempted to precisely model and predict the growth or spread of invasive plants, specifically 
in regards to using methods such as Machine Learning (Schneider et al. 2021). However, the vast majority of studies 
seem to attempt to predict events or scenarios that may come as a result of invasive plants (Faccenda et al. 2021) or 
seek to predict the distribution of invasive plants in either a highly general or specific area (Ahmed et al. 2020, and 
Jones et al. 2010). As a result, this paper seeks to understand (1) whether the size of spread of invasive plants varies 
by the types of species, and (2) whether time factor predicts their growth differently. More specifically, this study 
explores whether the relationship between time and the size of the spread of invasive species is curvilinear, such that 
spread increases precipitously early on and starts to slow down after some time. The hypothesized nonlinear 
relationship is further probed by using the types of the species as a moderator, such that the nonlinear relationship 
between the time and the size of spread varies by the types of the species. 
2. Literature Review
Previous studies on predicting the spread of invasive plants or determining key factors, either to determine the 
relationship between temperature on growth of invasive plants (Skálová et al. 2015) or to predict future locations of 
invasive plants through analyzing the ecological temperature (Ebeling et al. 2008).

339","relationship between time and the size of spread. The result of the baseline model (see below) showed that Time 
Elapsed was a significant predictor. 
However, after running the nonlinear regression and moderated nonlinear regression, it was determined that the 
quadratic regression model was more accurate. Thus, it appears that invasive plants spread much faster over time, 
possibly due in part to having more plants to spread.

Step 2:

Due to the significant positive correlation between TimeElapsed and DistanceSpread, it can be interpreted that the 
distance an invasive plant species spreads increases as the length in time increases. Table 6 shows the size of the 
coefficient (b = .0023), which indicates that one-day growth is associated with .0023 kilometers. 
Due to the significant positive correlation between TimeElapsed and DistanceSpread, it can be interpreted that the 
distance an invasive plant species spreads increases as the length in time increases. Table 6 shows the size of the 
coefficient (b = .0023), which indicates that one-day growth is associated with .0023 kilometers. 
 
After analyzing the data, both the one-way ANOVA test and the quadratic regression model showed significant 
relationship between the variables. The type of invasive plant and the time the invasive plant’s species has had to 
spread were both determined to be significant predictors on how far it will spread. Additionally, the quadratic 
regression model proved to be far more accurate in determining the relationship between the time elapsed and the 
spread of the invasive plant than the linear model. 
 
The significance of both of the independent variables makes sense and supports the hypothesis. For the first, as 
different plants spread in different ways, different invasive plants would spread differently. Also, the more time a 
plant species has had to spread, the more plants would be able to spread further seeds of their species. While the 
quadratic regression model proved to be more accurate in determining the relationship between the time elapsed and 
the spread than the linear regression model, it lent credence to the theory that more invasive plants would continue 
to spread more seeds, increasing their spread exponentially. 
 
5. Conclusions  
This paper examined whether the type of the invasive plants and time factor controlled their growth behavior, using 
one-way ANOVA, linear regression, and moderated nonlinear regression. Via each technique, the paper was able to 
determine the relationship and the strength between the type of plant and time their species has had to spread to the 
distance they have spread. The paper determined that there is strong proof that the type of plant and the time elapsed 
factors into how far the invasive plant has spread, along with the fact that a nonlinear quadratic regression model 
more accurately represents the relationship between time elapsed and the distance the invasive plant spreads. 
6. Future Research 
Through the findings, the paper not only determined whether or not different types of invasive plants and the time 
they have had to spread impact the distance spread, but it also determined the extent to which each time factor 
impacts the distance spread. Using this information, the most invasive plants, or the ones that spread the farthest

the future. Future work could, knowing the independent variables and their relation to the spread of invasive plants, 
seek to predict location at risk of invasive plants. Additionally, broader datasets from across the world could also be 
used to determine where invasive plants are likely to spread.

Abstract 
 
The research focused on the internet of things in heavy machine management with ConSite application usage. The 
main objective of this research is to examine the five variables (experience; subjective norms; self-efficacy; perceived 
usefulness, and perceived ease of use) affecting the intention to use the ConSite application at PT. HEXA in Indonesia. 
The research used a survey method by distributing an online questionnaire to 115 employees who are working in PT. 
HEXA, as the ConSite application users. For testing the hypotheses, the research adopted the Structural Equation 
Modeling method using SmartPLS software. Results have indicated that experience and self-efficacy have a positive 
and significant effect on both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, while subjective norms do not affect 
both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a positive 
significant direct effect on the intention to use the application of ConSite in PT HEXA. Furthermore, the results study 
implication and findings are discussed.

1. Introduction 
At the end of the 18th century when the first industrial revolution took place the labor and replaced by machines. The 
machines were operated by steam power. The second industrial revolution started around the 19th century when 
electrification and motorization replaced steam machines. An important invention of that time was the electric bulb 
invented by Thomas Alva Edison. The third industrial revolution started in the late 1960s with the appearance of 
computing technology which empower the automation of various human activities. 
 
Nowadays the market condition is very competitive, with the rapid change, and the business survival depends on the 
adaptability and capabilities of the companies to be innovative and perform with continuous improvement. The 
emergence of industry 4.0 has been accelerating to digitize and transforming the manufacturing of heavy machines 
management systems, not only for the production but also for the whole value chain (Merkel et al. 2017). Furthermore, 
industry 4.0 helps to increase and identify new business models and to satisfy the demand with products and services 
customization through intelligent operations and management (Gökalp et al. 2017; Mourtzis and Vlachou 2018). In 
conclusion, traditional manufacturing transformed into the digital ecosystem.  
 
The digital ecosystem implementation in the heavy machine system can achieve speedy and efficient maintenance 
service and also cost-effective production services including the services and after-sales (Rødseth, H., et.al. 2017; 
Silvestri et al. 2020). Most companies considered maintenance management systems as the initial steps to digitizing 
as it is important to have periodic maintenance (Mosyurchak et al. 2017). Due to the rapid increase of the mobile 
phone, the machine management system developed into a mobile application for a better report and is easily prepared

From the total 8 hypotheses, there are 2 hypotheses are not supported on this research. The subjective norms on 
perceived usefulness is insignificant and no effect meaning that the users of the Consite Shot App do not require the 
influence from other people nor the social environment as the decision to use the app included in the company policy

implementing the Consite Shot App when users have lack of knowledge and experience.  
 
The most dominant factor to influence the intention to use the Consite Shot App is Perceived Ease of Use. The app 
needs to be users’ friendly when they use the app for working. The research is limited to external variables such as 
experience, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, and endogenous variables namely perceived ease of use, perceived 
usefulness, and intention to use. For future research, may use some variables such as perceived risk, value, corporate 
image, benefits, satisfaction and so on. For the respondent may carry out to wider respondents in other industry or 
area.

Abstract 
This research study determined the maximum profit of the installation and application of waterproofing membrane 
using a linear programming model with the Microsoft Excel Solver aid.  Setting the decision variables, objective 
function, and constraints on the real-life construction projects, some essential decision-making pointers were collected 
after getting the optimal result.  This case is set in a month-long availability of the areas for installation and application 
of waterproofing system.  Each activity's production rates are taken from previous and on-going projects in a different 
location in the State of Qatar.  The construction projects are located in the municipalities and cities of Lusail, Doha, 
Rayyan, Al Khor, Umm Salal, Al Wakrah, Al Daayen, Al Shamal, and Al Sheehaniya.  The waterproofing system 
consists of PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) T-Lock, Bituminous membrane, cold-spray membrane, and cementitious 
membrane.

1. Introduction
Linear programming is used to maximize the efficiency of resources and was developed during World War II.  The 
development can be traced back to when a member of the US Air Force, George Dantzig, developed the Simplex 
method of optimization in 1947 when the need to provide an efficient algorithm in the solution of programming 
problems linear structures were present.  Thus, through the years, Linear Programming developments expanded their 
applications by experts in different fields such as mathematics and economics (Lewis  2008).  In recent years, advances 
in business, computer technology, and engineering research have created the need to develop different mathematical 
models.  These models represent various conditions and systems that use variables, functions, and parameters.  The 
mathematical models in creating and manipulating simple techniques and found to be a cheaper, safer, and faster idea 
(Martinich     1997), linear programming is defined as ""the problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function 
subject to linear constraints.""  In addition, linear programming can handle various problems like scheduling 
construction projects and transporting fuel from the refinery to consumers (Miller  2007).  Most managers use linear 
programming because of its benefits of it enable the practice problem formulation and result from the analysis that 
includes variable bounds and inequality constraints.  It gives vision to the ability of optimization.  It is commonly 
known as the foundation of other major optimization algorithms and is widely used in business and engineering 
practices (Marlin  2003). 
Qatar has an approximately 2.78 million population for a small peninsular state located west of the Arabian Gulf. 
Qatar's economy is continuously growing and expanding.  As a result of this, its commitment to hosting the prestigious 
2022 FIFA World Cup, infrastructure, and industrial projects have been in full blast for the past years.  In 2020, the 
state allocated an estimated 11.50 billion Qatari Riyals for new projects.  These government projects include the 2022 
FIFA World Cup Stadiums strategically located in different parts of the peninsula, such as Al Rayyan, Al Wakrah, 
and Al Khor.  Also, the Qatar Integrated Rail features a new US$40 billion railway and metro subway system with a 
high-speed passenger railway and freight line.  Furthermore, Qatar's Public Works Authority (ASHGHAL) has an 
expressway project program costing US$20 billion in projects in the development of significant motorways to address 
traffic congestion across the country.  These include are the Al Bustan Highway, Orbital Expressway, Al Rayyan-

In addition, the availability of area in the Al Sheehaniya project is limiting the profit increase as the projects in Lusail 
still has an available area of 13,823.53 square meters, in Doha has an available area of 23,823.53 square meters, in 
Rayyan has an available area of 823.53 square meters, in Al Khor has an available area of 2,441.18 square meters, 
Umm Salal has an available area of 941.18 square meters, Al Wakrah has an available area of 4,382.35 square meters, 
Al Daayen has an available area of 8,441.18 square meters, and lastly, in Al Shamal with an available area of 1,000 
square meters.  Lastly, the maximum profit we can get from those projects with linear programming is QAR 
112,658.82. 
 
5. Discussions 
The linear programming model we used in these scenarios indicates that the optimum result or maximum profit can 
be improved even more if the available areas for installation and application in the zero slack or binding constraint are 
increased.  In that way, our objective function will get a higher value where our objective is by knowing where our 
weaknesses in our operations, especially in construction projects, managers and executives of the company, can 
quickly decide to achieve a better result.  It is also essential to know that there is a great need to improve the production 
rate of PVC T-Lock installation, Bitumen installation, and cementitious application as it is far away from the 
production rate of spray membrane application to make a considerable advantageous and competitive revenue to the 
company.  It is highly recommended to have better and more frequent training to those weaker constraints on this case 
project. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on our analysis using linear programming carried out in the given scenario, the researcher concluded that 
opening more areas in the project location of Al Sheehaniya would increase a more significant profit.  Results revealed 
that the other materials' production rate is lesser than the spray waterproofing membrane.  Thus, the researcher 
concludes the need for more training and continuous improvement to both the operations and managers involved in 
the systems.  Also, the availability of installation and application areas affects its good advantage, thus, recommending 
having better resource planning and workforce allotment to maximize its profit.  The researcher recommended 
applying other accompanying risks to the task for further studies, such as environmental, safety, and other 
construction-related risks.  It is also recommended to look for other linear programming programs such as LINGO 
and TARO software to have a vast array of solutions to the problem.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to empirically select and prioritize suitable sustainability indicators for 
measuring and managing sustainability performance in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To 
achieve this objective, we applied a comprehensive methodological approach, which includes (1) 
conducting a systematic review to identify potential sustainability indicators in the literature, (2) designing 
a questionnaire based on the identified indicators, (3) pre-testing (pilot testing) of the questionnaire with 
selected industry experts, scholars, and researchers to further refine the indicators prior to data collection 
from the Italian footwear SMEs, and (4) selecting and prioritizing the final indicators using fuzzy Delphi 
method. The findings of the present paper show that the selected indicators emphasized measuring industrial 
sustainability performance related to financial benefits, costs, and market competitiveness for the economic 
sustainability dimension; resources for the environmental sustainability dimension; and customers, 
employees, and the community for the social sustainability dimension. The paper provides sustainability 
indicators considering the triple bottom line approach. The results of the present paper have significant 
academic, practical, and policy implications for measuring and managing industrial sustainability 
performance.

1. Introduction
The issues of industrial sustainability have become an essential topic of discussion (Cagno et al. 2019) and gains 
considerable attention among industrial decision-makers, policy-makers and scholars (Neri et al.  2018; Trianni et al., 
2017). Manufacturing is the most important driving force for a country's economic growth and social development 
(Galal and Moneim  2015; Zeng et al.  2008). However, they are one of the main contributors to environmental and 
social concerns (Zeng et al. 2008); and they are duly required to improve sustainability performance and be transparent 
on their sustainability practices (Trianni et al. 2019). Manufacturing companies need to adopt sustainability practices 
mainly for the following reasons: (1) pressures from various stakeholders (Huang and Badurdeen 2018; Ocampo et 
al. 2016; Zarte et al.  2019), (2) growing concerns about environmental and social impacts (Beekaroo et al.  2019; 
Samuel et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2018), and (3) to get a competitive advantage (Tseng et al. 2009; Veleva et al.  2001; 
Wang et al. 2018). To effectively adopt sustainability in manufacturing companies, measuring sustainability 
performance is crucial (Cagno et al. 2019; Trianni et al. 2019). The adoption of industrial sustainability considers 
actions taken at material, product, process, plant and production system levels (Tonelli et al. 2013). As a common 
understanding, the concept of sustainability considers economic, environmental and social aspects (Paramanathan et 
al. 2004; Zeng et al. 2008). Elkington (1997) proposed the triple bottom line (TBL) approach that consists of three 
interrelated (economic, environmental, and social) dimensions of sustainability. It is crucial to adopt a holistic 
approach based on TBL to adequately address industrial sustainability (Cagno et al. 2019). Manufacturing companies

However, it is subjected to the following limitations, which open opportunities for future research. The scope of this 
paper was limited at the firm level. However, it would be helpful to determine additional indicators that could be used 
to measure sustainability performance at the supply chain level for a more holistic view of sustainable manufacturing. 
Hence, it would be interesting for future research to expand the scope to the entire supply chain, which includes supply, 
production, distribution, use, and post-use stages. The paper focused on the indicators that have been used by scientific 
papers (i.e., academic papers). Therefore, as an additional avenue, future research could consider analyzing indicators 
used by the sustainability documents of organizations engaged in the sustainability performance measurement. 
Furthermore, it would be interesting for future research to consider governance indicators in addition to economic, 
environmental, and social indicators. In addition to Italian footwear firms, it would also be interesting for future 
research to carry out a comparative analysis considering the footwear firms of different countries (e.g., European 
countries) to assess the similarities and differences in the idicators from the perspective of geographical or national 
diversity.

Abstract 
Economies based on product-centric models have considerably shifted towards service-oriented solutions such as 
Product-Service Systems (PSSs). Facilities and properties are no exception where maintenance operations and 
activities play an essential role in their management. In this context, several tools are used to enhance the 
management performance of those facilities. Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated these topics while 
contemplating a shift from product-centered approaches to service-based models. The following study adopts a 
Building-Information Modeling (BIM) approach in a PSS environment to enhance the maintenance operations of 
facility-related equipment. In detail, a maintenance organization and management framework is constructed 
through the implementation of PSS-BIM integration. The study concerns the elevators of an existing structure 
where the framework is applied bringing forth the benefits that can be achieved notably in terms of reduced 
downtime, lower maintenance costs, and higher customer satisfaction. Despite the limitations of the intervention, 
the approach can be deemed as a reliable first step towards a more thorough PSS implementation in this sector.

1. Introduction
Through recent years, manufacturers and researchers alike have stressed the need to improve the manufacturing 
and management of products. Most notably, they pointed out the need to address the product’s entire life cycle 
and employ strategies enabling this approach (Tukker 2015). The product should be comprehensively optimized: 
the design, prototyping, validation, market launch, use and recovery must be considered throughout the product’s 
lifecycle to enhance its environmental performance and to have a positive effect on the manufacturer’s operations 
(Ulaga 2011). One of the most vital aspects to consider is the use phase of the product where the balance can 
easily towards the negative side of the scale if not handled properly (Takata et al. 2004; Haber et al. 2018). 
The transition towards Product-Service Systems (PSSs) has been highlighted as one of the most prominent 
approaches to improve the product’s performance and value through the entirety of its lifecycle stages. 
Application and use-oriented systems are no exception since the functioning of the product relies heavily on the 
effective planning and execution of its related maintenance operations (Wang et al. 2020). Products and equipment 
set up in buildings and facilities (i.e., communication systems, elevators, metal detectors, etc.) are not exempted 
(Fargnoli et al. 2019): the involvement of several stakeholders from one side, and the positioning in regulated 
markets on the other render the application of PSSs an encouraging answer. In detail, the need to balance between 
the various needs of different stakeholders combined with the fact that maintenance operations are supplied by 
the equipment manufacturer can be fulfilled via a PSS implementation (Vezzoli et al. 2015; Fargnoli et al. 2019). 
Furthermore, modern technologies such as distant servers, remote surveillance, and monitoring schemes and the 
infamous “Industry 4.0” (Bortoluzzi et al. 2020) can take the benefits of a PSS to the next level in a 
facility/building equipment environment. 
Numerous studies investigated a more extended servitization of the building equipment field: a design framework 
for personalized PSS solutions was brought forth by Song and Sakao (2018), Van Ostaeyen et al. (2013) explicated 
the advantages that a manufacturer can have by means of different PSS solutions, Ferreira Junior et al. (2022) 
illustrated the benefits of a PSS in handling the maintenance operations at a manufacturing plant, Cortesi et al. 
(2010) brought to light the positive environmental impact that a PSS can achieve using a case study at an elevator

Abstract 
Fifth- generation communication also known as internet of things is rolling out worldwide. It has provided higher 
network capacity and speed for mobile broadband communications; however, 5G network focuses only on terrestrial 
coverage. 6G and Cognitive Radio (CR) is expected to be the future solution to all heavy data traffic and globe 
coverage. Satellite communication is anticipated to cover rural areas, sea, spanning air, and space in what is known as 
Internet of Space Things (IoST). Low Earth Orbit (LEO) CubeSat orbits earth provide real time measurements with 
low transmission power and high data rate. Cognitive radio will focus on providing efficient spectrum use and 
resources allocations. In this paper, a multi CubeSat cognitive radio network is proposed to improve time delay, 
increase data exchange, and increase the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the communication system. simulation results 
demonstrate the convergence of the multi CubeSat system improving the signal to noise ratio for different number of 
CubeSats structure.

1. Introduction
Fifth generation communications are being deployed all around the world [1]. It has overcome many limitations of 
the previous generation systems from network capacity and reliability to higher data rate and reduced latency. 
However, the exponential rapid growth of data systems has exposed the limitations and challenges of 5G networks. 
Showcasing how it only focuses on terrestrial and urban areas leaving rural spaces uncovered, insufficient high-cost 
infrastructure, and unmatched downloading and uploading speeds [2].  
Satellite communication in 6G is an emerging technology envisioned to provide a full coverage with high data rate 
wireless system to all uncovered areas even air, sea, and space [3]. Satellite communication can be categorized into 
three categories depending on the satellite altitude and their weight. Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) orbits the 
earth at 35,800 km and uses high frequencies, Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) orbits with altitude 8,000 to 12,000 km, 
while Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are at altitudes of 500 to 2000 km [4]. GEO satellites form a more reliable connection 
to ground and have a higher data rate than LEO satellites. On the other hand, The altitude of the CubeSats provides 
higher flexibility to configuring reliable links between ground station and non-terrestrial network. Furthermore, their 
close proximity to earth yields to a shorter delay, making them more suitable for cellular and Global Positioning 
System GPS communications. 
 Space/Satellite industry is a rapidly growing research topic nowadays. According to the Morgan Stanley's report, the 
estimated revenue from the space industry will reach $1 trillion by 2040. Cube satellite (CubeSat) are contriving a big 
share in this market. They emerged from teaching material in universities [5] to military and commercial applications 
[6] [7]. A standard CubeSat has a mass of 1.33 kg, dimensions of 10cm*10cm*10cm, and orbits at an altitude of 500
to 2000 km [8].
The concept to connect multiple CubeSats to maximize space-air-ground network was first proposed by NASA [9] 
where CubeSats are networked with each other to form a swarm on the orbit. A matching Game-Based approach to 
join LEO satellites was proposed in [10]. The CubeSats topology was modeled as a form of a mixed integer nonlinear 
programming to simplify the large-scale networks. In [11], the authors studied the power budget from the LEO satellite 
to the ground and modeled the inter-CubeSat links.

We also simulated the probability of detection with respect to the average SNR for different number of CubeSats 
interconnected clusters. We can clearly observe how increasing the number of interconnected satellites improves the 
SNR as expected.

3. Conclusion  
In this paper, we have presented a multi-CubSat cognitive radio network. The satellites were interconnected forming 
multiple clusters on the LEO orbit. To improve spectrum efficiency, a decentralized cognitive radio technique is 
applied. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence of the CubeSats consensus algorithm and how does the 
number of interconnected satellites effect the probability of detection.     
For future work, we should study and interconnection cluster that accounts for link failure, and satellite movement.  
Also, a thorough study of the design of the physical layer will help obtain an accurate modelling of the satellite 
channels.

Abstract 
In this paper, the proponents have utilized the deep learning models of 3dCNN and LSTM along with 
OpenCV for webcam functionalities and Google's MediaPipe Framework to develop the American Sign 
Language Interpreter System. The objective of this study is as follows: First is to test the proponents' own 
dataset on Tran's network model (Tran et al.  2020) and gather experimental results for comparison. 
Second, The proponents did a modification of Tran's model network by adding an LSTM layer to 
accommodate the temporal structure of the proponents' dataset. Overall, the metrics of Training Accuracy 
and F1-Score were used as the basis for the performance of each model network ﹣Tran's network model 
performed well by achieving an 81.6% accuracy during training and 81.8% on the F1-Score in real-time. In 
comparison, the proponent model achieved an 89.9% accuracy on training and 89.8% in real-time. The 
most notable difference is during real-time, as the proponents' model classified the gestures more correctly. 
It uses the sequence prediction that is made possible by the LSTM layer.

1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total percentage of people suffering from hearing impairment 
is five percent (5%) (World Health Organization 2021). These are a collection of people born deaf and people who 
lost their hearing throughout their lives. That approximates to 430 million people worldwide having a hearing 
impairment. It is projected that this number can rise to 630 million by 2030 and 900 million by 2050 (World Health 
Organization 2021). That means five percent of the world’s population communicates through sign language and 
gestures. One of the most potent means of communication among humans is through gestures (Oudah et al.  2020).  
Sign Language uses the visual-manual modality to explain the meaning of a specific gesture (Quer et al. 2019). To 
date, there are a total of thirty-eight (138) different types of sign language that are known, and most of them have the 
same linguistics but differ in gestures (Media  2020). In addition, the researchers chose the most prominently used 
sign language in the world, which is the American Sign Language (ASL). This paper will focus on developing a system 
that can detect the mentioned sign languages to bridge the gap between the people who are unable to comprehend and 
those sign users. 
1.1 Objectives 
The study aims to use the previous deep learning model network towards the proponent's ASL gesture dataset. 
Specifically, it aims to determine the network model of (Tran et al, 2020) in distinguishing the ASL gesture dataset. 
Moreover, it aims to introduce and utilize the LSTM model when predicting the sequence of hand gestures.

6. Conclusion 
6.1 Interpretations 
The custom dataset provided by the proponents are composed of 6,270 videos that are classified and 
divided into the eleven (11) gestures have been tested on two (2) different networks ﹣the first network is 
based from the study of Tran et al. (2020) which utilizes an all 3dCNN model while the second was derived 
from the same network with the addition of a single LSTM network before the output layer. Subsequently, 
the dataset had been used on the base model and achieved results close to the obtained outputs from the 
reference study ﹣On Chapter IV the researchers it is evident that a single iteration from the base model 
reached an accuracy of 94.8% which is the highest among the others and considered as a good model 
score. In contrast, an iteration of the proposed model with the best performance had a slight increase in 
accuracy by achieving a 96.2% ﹣this is due to the fact that an LSTM network supports the sequence 
prediction which is an essential part when recognizing hand gestures as it follows a systematic manner.  
 
The proponent’s model performed better in terms of classifying gestures in real-time ﹣89.8% was the F1 
score for the proponents model while 81.8% was achieved using Tran’s model. This method is a great tool 
to differentiate the performance of the models. Another reason for the difference in real time performance 
is that the proponents' model utilizes an LSTM layer that supports sequence prediction and better 
interpretation while Tran’s model was not able to recognize the correct order of gestures immediately. This 
is due to the same movements used on the gestures that lead to misclassification when using the latter 
network model. 
 
6.2 Future Works 
For future works regarding this study, data is an integral part which means data used on future works should 
have more variety towards them ﹣ particularly towards the distance of the participant from the camera. As 
explained in the previous chapter, the real time detection has a harder time detecting gestures when the 
person isn’t half body in the frame. Another  is to go beyond the said eleven (11) gestures that were used 
in this study. For the program to detect and classify more gestures of ASL, not just gestures that use one 
hand but also gestures that utilize two hands. There are gestures that use two hands ra
ther than one in 
ASL. This can be the basis program for a mobile application that helps non-signers understand hearing and 
speaking impaired individuals.

Abstract 
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been reluctant to gain attraction in the procurement segment of a company, 
many organizations have started to see its potential in the supply chain activities since it enables numerous sectors in 
the evolution of their business models. AI refers to intelligent algorithms or apparatuses that are capable of 
autonomously and systematically performing activities or cognitions without human intervention or mental 
decisions. In procurement and supply chain applications, AI can enhance design and operational frameworks, data 
visibility and analytics, opportunity assessment, accurate report generation and contract management, etc. This paper 
presents opportunities and applications of AI in procurement with particular emphasis on the procurement process 
carried out by Qatar Foundation (QF). QF is a non-profit organization which has a unique system as it involves over 
50 entities with different activities related to education, research, and community development. This one-of-a-kind 
ecosystem comprises a unique and complex supply chain model. As a result, procuring different materials and 
services to cope with all entities’ requirement is a challenge due to the tremendous amount of data and purchases. 
The use of AI methodologies is anticipated to provide multiple benefits towards achieving improvements over 
diverse areas.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 (I4) technologies towards the digital transformation of the procurement process are evolving to enhance 
it as I4 enables the connection of the physical and digital environments, resulting in better decision making and 
increased resilience and efficiency. Based on Deloitte (n.d.), digital technologies are categorized to the degree in 
which they are deployed in procurement into three categories: core, maturing, and emerging. The core category 
represents solutions already implemented in larger systems with longer implementation, including spending 
analytics, eSourcing, electronic catalogs, contract management, supplier information management, eProcurement, 
eInvoicing, and eAuctions. The maturing category covers solutions that transform procurement with minimal 
investment: cognitive computing/artificial intelligence, intelligent content extraction, predictive/advanced analytics, 
visualization, collaboration networks, crowdsourcing, 3D printing, and robotics. Finally, the emerging technologies 
are the solutions that could impact procurement in the future, including blockchain, sensors, cyber tracking, and 
virtual reality. 
According to Oxford Dictionary (2005), AI is defined as the theory and development of computer systems capable 
of performing activities ordinarily requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, 
decision-making, and language translation. AI is the driving force of the fourth industrial revolution in the same way 
as mechanization, mass production, and automated production were previously (Sammalkorpi and  Teppala  2019). 
The development of Industry 4.0 revolution is illustrated in Figure 1.

5. Conclusion 
Industry 4.0 technologies and the digitalization of the procurement process are evolving in this field, resulting 
efficient decision making and increased efficiency. AI is efficient at solving complex problems containing a vast 
amount of data. Such a technology has the potential to manage all the data from multiple sources, including supplier 
management software, online catalogs, and contracts. AI can automatically consolidate data, process data, and 
utilize it across business operations with its set of algorithms. Applying this know-how enables clients to constantly 
monitor and use complex information at any phase of the procurement cycle, from supplier identification to adopting 
deals, monitoring invoices, and organizing orders. Besides value extraction, analysis visibility, and quick and 
accurate automated data integration, AI also helps customers manage procurement performance by fastening 
decision-making, disclosing savings and cost visibility, and using machine learning to generate reports. 
 
QF is a unique organization with different entities involved in education, research, and community development. 
This uniqueness in products and services created challenges in purchases categorization. Using AI by procurement 
department in QF will help to overcome the current challenges and will contribute in QF AI strategy. Therefore, 
adopting AI in procurement in QF is anticipated to provide numerous benefits for procurement and supply chain 
applications.

Abstract 
This study utilized the pre-emptive Goal Programming (GP) model in the optimization problem in the Tower Crane 
Installation process. Secondary data was collected from an anonymous tower crane installer covering the entire 
operations in the Philippines. The preemptive GP model contains 4 variables and 12 constraints which and this study 
showed the preemptive GP results where only 3 out of 12 goals were achieved. The other 9 goals were not satisfied. 
Priority 1 and Priority 2 were not attained with positive deviations, suggesting that the total tower crane installation 
hours exceeded beyond 30 hours as well as incurring rental cost reserve of not more than P105,000. Priority 3, 
meanwhile, was attained with no positive deviation, suggesting that the mast can be installed in around 10 hours. 
Priority 4,5,6,7,8, and 9 were not attained with slight positive deviations observed, represented in hours, indicating 
that the goals established by the organization are not attainable. Priority 10 was attained with no deviations observed 
and Priority 12 was attained with negative deviation, suggesting that the organization can extend the total headcount 
and deploy additional headcount whenever necessary to ease the cost and duration of the tower crane installation. The 
results of the preemptive GP model were anchored in the formulation Risk Management Plan, reinforced by Cost-
Benefit Analysis (CBA), helping the small to middle-market tower crane operators in the Philippines to mitigate the 
risk of installation delays and potential wastage in the cost and budget, as induced by this delay.

1. Introduction
The construction industry in the Philippines is deemed to be a key sector and one of the key economic drivers. As 
reported by Statista Research, the industry contributed to a gross value of approximately 336 billion pesos in the Q4 
of 2020. In addition, the total construction expenditures by both private and public firms, have shown significant 
contractions in 2020 mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. While slowdown in the industry has seen, it 
has been projected to propel in the next few years, as the current political and regulatory environment of the country 
makes it very conducive for the construction industry to thrive. One market that greatly benefited from the construction 
industry’s growth in the Philippines, is the tower crane market. As Market Study reported, the global tower crane 
market size is poised to expand in the next 3 years, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.1%, or 
forecasted to exceed $2304.9 million by 2025, from $2042.9 million in 2019. The tower crane market is segmented 
by type such as the Self-erecting tower cranes, Flat Top tower cranes, Hammerhead tower cranes, Luffing Jib tower 
cranes. While in terms of application, tower cranes are used in the Dam building, Bridge building, Shipyards, Power 
Plants, and High-rise buildings. 
Tower Crane market is broad in its scope and there are various business activities that are performed under this domain. 
One business activity is the tower crane installation, which is a niche segment under the tower crane market. Tower 
crane installation activity is deemed to be a critical aspect of the whole construction pipeline and is considered to be 
the preliminary step for contractors and owners who engaged in any types of construction activities. Installation

₱161,708 cost of delay will be eradicated. Hence, the computed BCR is 1.39 means that the benefits exceed the costs, 
and the project can proceed without any expected complications should they opted to deploy additional headcount of 
2 erectors and 2 riggers, in order to mitigate or better, eliminate the delay in the completion of the tower crane 
installation. 
As for the direction for future research, the locus of the study creates an opportunity for future research to examine 
the similar mathematical model on a specific context or location given that this study focused on all the activities 
throughout the country from the selected company, hence, results might change, geographically and demographically. 
This study emphasizes the need of the tower crane market to implement quantitative approaches, specifically the 
preemptive GP model that was utilized in this paper, in order to optimize the cost and duration in the tower crane 
installation.

Abstract 
The Leather Industry is one of the most important sectors in the Magetan region. However, there are certain problems 
encountered in the finishing stage of bag production, such as the operator's inapt working posture and the improper 
layout of accessories and equipment. This study aims to develop an alternative workbench design for improving the 
operator's working posture, providing a proper layout of accessories and production equipment, and accelerating the 
manufacture of leather bags. Based on the NIDA method, there were two alternative workbenches, of which the second 
was selected as the best choice to improve the operator's working posture and provide a proper layout of accessories 
and production equipment.

1. Introduction
The leather industry is one of the most important sectors in Magetan. However, there are many problems encountered 
in the production process, in various establishments, such as in Pak Ardhi's Leather Bag industry, which is one of the 
major commercial enterprises in Magetan, East Java. These problems were mostly encountered in the finishing stage 
of the production process, such as the operator's inapt working posture and the improper layout of accessories and 
equipment. 
Work posture is the position adopted by workers while carrying out their job (Nurmianto, 2004). It is closely related 
to Ergonomics, the study of the ideal physical stance and mental well-being, to prevent the risk of ill health, accidents, 
or other occupational hazards. For a work pose to be considered good, research and evaluation should be conducted 
by experts in the scientific field of Ergonomics. People who constantly adopt wrong or non-ergonomic postures are 
prone to tiredness, lack of concentration, and decreased level of accuracy, which leads to work accidents, 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), and other dysfunctions (Andrian, 2013). An operator installing accessories in a 
sitting position on the floor without a base, and with a bent neck is at risk of developing a musculoskeletal injury when 
this is practiced continuously. 
The lack of organization and improper arrangement of accessories and equipment, used at the finishing stage is 
problematic, for instance, when it takes a longer period to find a particular instrument, therefore, leading to wastage 
of time. Hence, this study aims to develop an ergonomic workbench design and SOPs for operators at the finishing 
stage in the Magetan Leather Bag Industry. The result is expected to improve the operator's work posture and reduce 
the time wasted in searching for certain accessories and equipment, thereby, maximizing productivity.

Figure 7. Posture Score After Using Finishing Workbench 
Based on the operator's posture angle after using the workbench, it is observed that the application of the desk reduced 
the risk of working pose. The risk level of work posture plummeted to 5 (from 8). Therefore, decreasing from high 
risk to medium, because the operator is working on the finishing process of installing accessories with a more 
ergonomic posture. The improved finishing stage coupled with the application of SOPs for the Magetan Leather 
industry, increases operators' productivity. 
 
Based on the evaluation of the Magetan Leather Bag industry, the improvement lies in familiarizing the operators with 
the intricacies of the newly developed workbench, by integrating the use of SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) into 
the desk application. 
 Therefore, the proposed solution plans were: 
1. Implementation and Confirmation of SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), for an orderly work process to 
be achieved.  
2. Operators should understand how each feature of the workbench functions to facilitate work 
familiarization. The SOP is in the form of procedures for placing tools and bag accessories in the 
appropriate positions, and has been determined as follows: 
a. Long shelf: put a zipper bag. 
b. Racks: put tools, such as hammers and pliers. 
c. Drawer: a place to set aside for accessories, separated by a drawer divider. 
Familiarization with the workbench help to reduce the risk of occupational health hazards and improve safety (K3), 
abate Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), maintains standard working rules, and good postures. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The application of the REBA method shows that workbench is an important facility that enables a good operator's 
working posture, reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, and maximizing productivity. It also helps in the time 
optimization as accessories are neatly arranged to be easily accessed. However, it is necessary to be familiarized and 
comfortable using the workbench, to assuage unprofessionalism and unnecessary stress as a new user.

Abstract 
Usually, exam time is imposed by the educational institution to facilitate examining a huge number of students within 
a limited time frame. While the instructors might consider the mid-level (both in knowledge and skills) students while 
preparing the exams, slower students might get overlooked. In this research, four midterm exams were used to study 
the effect of extended exam time on the students’ performance. The four exams were given to the students with a 
standard established time limit, and, in a different semester, were given to another group of students with extended 
time. The results proved that students generally performed better in the extended time exams with higher differences 
for mid-level students than for top and low level. It is recommended that instructors should consider the slower (in 
reading, writing and/or doing calculations) students while preparing their limited time exams.

1. Introduction
Classroom Assessment (CA) is defined as a straightforward approach designed by a faculty member to identify what, 
how much, and how well their students are taught (Angelo 1995). CA is the primary source of information for students, 
parents, and instructors about the students’ learning process (Brookhart 2003). The two primary purposes of CA are 
known to be formative and summative. Formative assessment is designed and conducted to direct the teaching process 
to achieve its goals. The feedback from such an appraisal helps the instructor to judge their teaching techniques and 
to adjust them as needed. On the other hand, the summative assessment aims at providing third parties (parents, school

5. Discussion 
It is factually undeniable that everything in our life runs against time, especially in the professional engineering realm. 
Construction projects, production schedules, supply chains deliveries, new products introduction and many other 
engineering applications are all bounded by time. All of this makes it important to train engineering students to develop 
their engineering knowledge and skills against time. However, a debatable argument of whether to develop those 
engineering skills by adding the time pressure factor to exams assessment or postpone such pressure exposure to their 
early professional life where the scope of the engineering problems is eminent and professional supervision and 
support are available. Lewandowski et al. raised the question regarding the instructors' need to test the speed of the 
students as a skill by itself. This study aims to confirm the significance of relationship between exam time and exam 
content on the students’ performance. 
 
The results obtained in this study support the assumption that exam time limit affects students’ scores significantly. 
In three of the four studied exams, the t-test results indicated a significant difference between students’ scores in 
regular exam time and extended exam time with p-values ranging between 0.006 and 0.049. These conclusions match 
those of Alster (1997) and Cohen (2005) for students without learning disability. The fourth exam did not show a 
significant difference between students’ scores in regular time and extended time. This might be due to the nature of 
this exam being an ‘open book’ exam. It might also be due to the significant difference in the students’ level (measured 
by accumulative GPA) in favor of the regular exam time students. The given exam time extension might have closed 
the gap between the students.  
 
In exams 2 & 3, the results showed significant differences between top, medium and low-level students in both groups 
with a p-value for exam 2 ranging between 0.000 and 0.030 and the p-value for exam 3 ranging between 0.008 and 
0.015. For exam 1 only medium or low-level students had significantly different scores with p-values ranging between 
0.000 and 0.020. These results show that students on all levels, generally, benefited from the extended time.  
 
The effect size numbers show that middle-level students benefited more from the time extension than the other two 
groups in exams 1, 2, and 3. In exam 1, Cohen’s d value for mid-level students was 1.23 (very large effect) compared 
to 0.62 (medium to high impact) for the low-level students and no significant difference for the top-level students. In 
exam 2, Cohen’s d value for mid-level students was 1.94 (almost huge effect) compared to 1.17 (large effect) and 0.58 
(medium to large impact) for top and low-level students, respectively. In exam 3, Cohen’s d value for mid-level 
students was 1.66 (very large to huge effect) compared to 1.20 (very large effect) and 1.28 (very large impact) for top 
and low-level students respectively. These results verify that mid-level students are the most vulnerable to the exam 
time limitations, as they might have the needed knowledge and skills to perform better in the exam. Still, their scores 
are restricted by the exam time.  
 
Results of F-test for the equality of variance indicated non-significance for all comparisons amongst exams 1-3 except 
for group 5 vs. group 6 and for group 1 (L) vs. group 2 (L). In both cases, the variance was significantly lower in the 
extended time exam with p-values 0.03 and 0.01 respectively. The values of the variance in Tables 2-4 show mixed 
pattern with the trend towards reduction in the extended time exams. Variance comparisons in exam 4 do not seem to 
provide a useful interpretation which may be due to the small size of the tested sample. 
 
6. Conclusion 
As the exam time limitations, imposed by the educational institutions, might be hard to change, the research results 
recommend that the exam content be reviewed as the exam time might not be sufficient for all students to perform up 
to their level of knowledge and skills. The instructors might consider the average level (in both knowledge and skills) 
students’ capability to finish all questions within the given exam time. However, it is easy to overlook the slower 
students who might perform much better if they had extra time for reading, writing and/or doing calculations.  
 
The study in this paper is correlational in nature and does not investigate the causation behind the presented 
observations. Extra research in this topic is needed for better understanding. Several limitations apply to this study 
due to the nature of participants and structure of considered exams. As mentioned earlier in the paper, all students are 
senior male engineering students. Also all courses’ materials and exams are administered in English language which 
is the students’ second language. Exams considered do not include essay questions (short or long) and do not need 
sophisticated math to solve them thoroughly.

Abstract 
Researchers and practitioners have long been interested in developing effective priority rules for a variety of 
production systems.  Implementing some of these priority rules require robust computing resources and networks to 
collect and analyze data in real time to provide decision support to station operators in production systems.  Numerous 
priority rules have been developed and implemented in a variety of production systems.  Some of these priority systems 
like Kanban in Just-In-Time (JIT) systems have been deployed using simple and creative ways.  However, others 
require computing resources and networks to implement effectively.  One such priority rule is NERJIT that uses real 
time information about demand for each product and each station’s Work-In-Process (WIP) units (Ardalan, Diaz, 
2012).  NERJIT for a product in a station is determined by subtracting the WIP of that product in that station and all 
the station’s downstream stations from demand for that product.  NERJIT is the amount of deficit for each product at 
each station.  Operators assign priority based on NERJIT and produce products with the largest deficit.  The use of 
this priority rule requires real time information about demand and WIP for each product in each station.   
While NERJIT priority rule is easy to understand, its calculation for each product in each station requires a nimble/real 
time data collection and information sharing system that can provide real-time information about the state of the 
system to each station.  NERJIT for a product at a station is determined by subtracting WIP for that product in that 
station and its downstream stations from demand for that product.  The WIP for that product is the sum of the number 
of units of that product currently being processed in that station and all its downstream stations, the number of units 
of that product in the output stock points of that station and all its downstream stations, and the number of units of 
that product in input stock points of that station’s downstream stations. 
Application of NERJIT in a production system with dynamic order arrival creates a challenging, if not impossible, 
situation for station operators, especially when customer arrivals are unknown and dynamic.  This priority rule can be 
applied only when the data for its calculation is collected and applied in real-time. 
This presentation discusses the information systems architecture, data flow, information systems’ resources and 
facilities such as scanners, radio frequency identification devices, online application processing, database technology, 
and a network that are necessary to implement this priority rule.  The costs and benefits and sensitivity analysis of the 
overall system including the type and profitability of the product versus the cost of the information system will be 
presented.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the importance of the supply chain of vaccines from the movement restrictions 
that have been imposed everywhere. Vaccination is simply one step in the fight against Covid-19. The procurement 
of the Covid-19 vaccine is a critical step in promoting herd immunity and reducing viral transmission. The 
implementation of any immunization program is seen as a problematic element as it depends on the vaccine supply 
chain. To achieve a specific percentage of the population vaccinated according to the vaccination program, it requires 
the timeliness of the vaccines delivered, since it has become a race for public health and economic recovery. As a 
result, prior to vaccinating the population, governments should establish a countrywide distribution plan based on 
careful observation of numerous factors to ensure the success and efficiency of the vaccination campaign, therefore, 
securing the distribution channel is a crucial step towards a successful vaccination program. This article compares the 
vaccine supply chain in Indonesia and Hungary. Needless to say, that both countries are not comparable in size, 
population, GDP, and many other aspects. However, the comparison is limited only on the supply chain mechanism 
to see its effectiveness. It is expected that the distribution of the vaccine in Hungary is simpler than Indonesia. This 
article is essentially about explanatory research, taking sources from existing literature and databases. The expected 
results explain the success and barrier factors affecting the streamlined distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in 
Indonesia and Hungary, and what we can learn from examples of these two countries.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is the official name for the coronavirus disease 2019. It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which 
had not previously been identified in humans. More than 200 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, and the 
disease has claimed around 4.3 million lives. The pandemic continues to put health systems under severe strain, but 
regulators have approved safe treatments, and countries have launched their vaccination programs. The disease, which 
was found in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has caused several cases of Viral Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology 
(VPUE). The source of the disease might have come from patients who have been working in the Huanan Seafood 
Wholesale Market, a place famous as a selling hub of animals (Ali et al. 2020). On March 11, 2020, WHO declared 
this type of disease called COVID-19 as a pandemic (Ducharme, 2020). Pandemic is a term for the global disease 
situation. The virus that has been spread over the world possesses high attack rates and explosiveness, high severity,

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the importance of the supply chain of vaccines from the movement restrictions 
that have been imposed everywhere. Vaccination is simply one step in the fight against Covid-19. The procurement 
of the Covid-19 vaccine is a critical step in promoting herd immunity and reducing viral transmission. The 
implementation of any immunization program is seen as a problematic element as it depends on the vaccine supply 
chain. To achieve a specific percentage of the population vaccinated according to the vaccination program, it requires 
the timeliness of the vaccines delivered, since it has become a race for public health and economic recovery. As a 
result, prior to vaccinating the population, governments should establish a countrywide distribution plan based on 
careful observation of numerous factors to ensure the success and efficiency of the vaccination campaign, therefore, 
securing the distribution channel is a crucial step towards a successful vaccination program. This article compares the 
vaccine supply chain in Indonesia and Hungary. Needless to say, that both countries are not comparable in size, 
population, GDP, and many other aspects. However, the comparison is limited only on the supply chain mechanism 
to see its effectiveness. It is expected that the distribution of the vaccine in Hungary is simpler than Indonesia. This 
article is essentially about explanatory research, taking sources from existing literature and databases. The expected 
results explain the success and barrier factors affecting the streamlined distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in 
Indonesia and Hungary, and what we can learn from examples of these two countries.

ABSTRACT  
PT XYZ is an industrial company manufacturing aggregate and hydraulic cement concrete (mixture). The 
problem faced by the company is excess aggregate stock which results in excess stock in the warehouse so 
that the company suffers a loss. The purpose of this study is to streamline the company's storage costs by 
using the EOQ and Reorder Point methods. This type of research is descriptive with quantitative methods. 
The EOQ method can determine the order quantity so that it can minimize the overall inventory cost, 
while the Reorder Point Models determine when the right point in time for the inventory of goods in the 
warehouse should be added. In addition, the EOQ and ROP methods are proven to be able to streamline 
the company's storage costs.

Abstract 
The banking industry as an industry engaged in services relies on service quality as the main strategy in increasing 
customer satisfaction and interest in using the products offered. In Indonesia, there are four state-owned enterprises 
in the bank industry: Bank BRI, Bank BTN, Bank BNI, and Bank Mandiri. Good quality of bank services can 
increase customer satisfaction and can indirectly have a positive effect on increasing state revenues. This study will 
analyze the quality of service at a state-owned bank, the largest mortgage bank in Indonesia, using the dimensions of 
service quality variables, namely tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, through the IPA 
analysis method (importance performance analysis). This study uses survey data from 107 respondents with a total 
of 15 service quality attributes. IPA analysis in this study uses a Cartesian diagram consisting of 4 quadrants on the 
Cartesian diagram, namely quadrant A (priority), Quadrant B (maintain service quality), Quadrant C (low priority), 
and quadrant D (excessive). The results of this study indicate a comparison between the level of interest 
(expectations) of customers with the level of actual service performance.

1. Introduction
The banking industry in Indonesia from year to year continues to change. The state of Indonesia itself has four state-
owned banking companies operating for quite a long time. The four state-owned banking companies are BNI, 
Mandiri, BTN, and BRI. As state-owned enterprises, these four banking companies should provide the best service 
compared to private companies and become the most chosen bank in Indonesia. It is because state-owned banks, 
namely BNI, Mandiri, BTN, and BRI, must contribute to the state from the company's performance in terms of taxes 
and dividends in order to increase the country's GDP. For this reason, analyzing the performance of state-owned 
banks is vital to improving the Indonesian economy in the banking sector. 
Among the four state-owned banking companies, bank X is the bank that has the lowest performance compared to 
other banks in recent years. It can be seen from the performance data of state-owned banks based on profit, credit, 
and assets. For example, based on profit data, Bank X is the only state-owned bank with a profit of under 1 trillion, 
which is 723 billion in 2019. In addition, based on the value of TPF, Bank X is ranked the lowest after Bank 
Mandiri, BRI, and BNI in 2021 (www.cnnindonesia.com). Even so, Bank X in 2020 seeks to reorganize its business

6. Conclusion 
Based on the explanation of the research results above, several conclusions were obtained, namely as follows: 
1. Based on the results of data processing using the IPA (importance performance analysis) method, it was found 
that the average level of conformity of employee performance with consumer expectations is 92%, so it is 
considered that 15 service quality attributes of Bank X Kuningan branch office, South Jakarta have been quite 
satisfactory to consumers. 
2. Each of the quadrants above shows the location of the Bank's service quality attributes in terms of the level of 
performance and level of importance. In quadrant A there are three attributes, namely RY2, RY3, and E3 where 
quadrant A shows a high level of importance but very low performance. Quadrant A is a top priority for the Bank to 
improve employee performance so that they are able to meet high consumer expectations for the three service 
quality attributes. 
3. Quadrant B shows the service quality attributes that are already very good with a high level of importance and 
high performance. Quadrant B consists of five attributes, namely RY1, E2, E4, T3, and A2 so that the Bank must be 
able to maintain service quality on these five attributes. 
4. Next is quadrant C. Quadrant C has a low priority because it is an attribute that is not too important for consumers 
and low employee performance. Quadrant C consists of three attributes, namely RS1, T1, and T2.

5. Finally, Quadrant D is a low level of importance and a high level of performance. Quadrant D is considered an 
excessive quadrant because the performance provided exceeds the expectations or expectations of consumers. 
Quadrant D consists of four attributes, namely A1, RS2, A3, and E1.

Abstract 
The diversity of people's needs in financial context nowadays has pulled many financial companies to offer financial 
service using technology, the most popular is an e-wallet (electronic wallet). Currently, more people are shifting their 
financial activity to use an e-wallet. While e-wallet has become more prevalent in many countries including Indonesia, 
it is essential to understand the basic concept of user behavior towards e-wallet usage. Based on the previous study, 
this phenomenon can be explained using the technology acceptance model theory. Therefore, this study discusses the 
user's views regarding the use of e-wallet and the factors that influence behavioral intention to use based on the theory 
of technology acceptance model. The results of this study discuss two main factors influencing people to use an e-
wallet, namely perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness 
Keywords 
e-wallet, technology acceptance model, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intention to use.
1. Introduction
Technological developments have shaped significant changes in people's lives, one of which is the needs of 
transactions and financial management (Farmania et al. 2021). For this reason, many companies innovate in financial 
technology, one of which is often known as an electronic wallet (e-wallet) or electronic wallet. Moreover, they are 
currently trying to expand their market share in the financial company sector, often known as fintech (Pradipta & 
Tresia  2021). In Indonesia, several fintech companies even have a number of users up to millions of consumers and 
have collaborated with many partners.  
According to a survey by www.katadata.co.id in 2018, around 25 million online payment users will continue to grow 
in Indonesia. In addition, according to a survey from DailySocial 2018, Gopay is the most popular online payment in 
Indonesia, followed by OVO in second place. Referring to Article 1 paragraph 7 of Bank Indonesia Regulation number 
18/40/PBI/2016 of 2016 concerning the Implementation of Payment Transaction processing, In addition, Bank 
Indonesia as the Central Bank in Indonesia has also issued a policy called the National Non-Cash Movement (GNNT) 
so that people move to use the non-cash payment system. E-money is a new form of money in Indonesia, while an e-
wallet is an electronic wallet that can be used via a smartphone. GNNT was formed to increase public understanding 
of cashless transactions by increasing this awareness in changing the customs and culture of the community from cash 
transactions to non-cash transactions in their economic activities (Suroso et al.  2021).

of this survey also show that more respondents think they cannot decide to use e-wallet or cash transactions, this 
reason because many merchants and industries have changed the transaction process using electronic thus it makes 
easier for buyers to make transactions via e-mail. There are still many types of transactions that require someone to 
make transactions directly, especially in traditional markets. The survey results show the high interest of the 
Indonesian people to use e-wallet in conducting transactions. Even though respondents know that e-wallet technology 
has some risks that cash transactions do not have, respondents still choose to use e-wallet. This is as shown in the 
following survey results: 
 
 
Figure 7.  Result of Second Indicator of Behavioral Intention to Use 
 
Based on the answers to the survey above, as many as 376 respondents said they strongly agree to continue using e-
wallet even though respondents are aware that e-wallet technology has some risks and uncertainties such as the risk 
of transaction failure, the unstable internet connection that can interfere with the transaction process, cybercrimes, etc. 
It is shows the high interest and acceptance of e-wallet technology in Indonesia. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study discusses the perception of the Indonesian people regarding the use of e-wallet in conducting transactions 
seen from the conceptual theory of technology acceptance model (TAM) by (Davis 1989). This survey indicates that 
the Indonesian people percived the benefits and conveniences of e-wallet technology in assisting the transaction 
process and show a high interest in using e-wallet by the public. In addition, this study explains that the technology 
acceptance strategy designed by e-wallet companies has been successfully implemented in Indonesia. This research 
can provide insight to many people that the Indonesian people have a great interest in new technology and can adapt 
quickly as long as the technology can positively impact its users. The novelty of this study is the current perception 
of technology users of e-wallet in Indonesia based on the conceptual theory of TAM through the online survey. For 
future research we suggest to do comprehensive analysis using other variables to complete this research results.

Abstract 
The use of e-commerce in Indonesia continues to increase. One of the things that support this phenomenon is the 
successful implementation of e-CRM strategies by e-commerce companies. E-CRM is a strategy to manage the 
relationship between consumers and companies through technological intermediaries. This paper will explain the e-
CRM factors that most influence changes in customer behavior in Indonesia in shopping using e-commerce platforms. 
The research method used is a descriptive analysis based on survey results from 780 e-commerce users spread 
throughout Indonesia. This study indicates that there are four e-CRM factors that are most desirable and affect the use 
of e-commerce, namely customization, interactivity, choice, and site security. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In today's modern era, internet communication technology (ICT) has become a necessity for society. In Indonesia, the 
millennial generation is known as heavy smartphone users with an average of 4-6 hours a day (Farmania et al. 2019). 
The widespread use of ICT technology causes a shift in culture and lifestyle in people who want speed, convenience, 
and effectiveness in daily activities (Lee et sal.  2016). 
Changes in people's lifestyles that are all technologically advanced make many businesses today have to be able to 
adapt to changes in consumer behavior that is digitized. It requires many industries to be able to enter the digital era 
in the developed business operational systems. In Indonesia, the development of digital startups continues to increase 
significantly. Based on data by (Kominfo  2015) there are about 7.4 million people shopping online and this number 
continues to rise every year. This is due to people's increasing use of gadgets and the internet in Indonesia. In addition, 
the retail value of e-commerce has also increased significantly. 
An easy and fast way of shopping is an activity favored by many people in today's era. In order to fulfill the desires 
and expectations of consumers who want fast and instant things, many companies are setting up buying and selling 
services quickly through online platforms, which are now often known as e-commerce. E-commerce is a platform that 
brings together sellers and buyers to conduct buying and selling activities quickly and easily by relying on advances 
in internet technology (Dan  2014; Hong & Cha  2013).

4.4 Site Security 
The next e-CRM value that e-commerce must pay attention to is site security. Based on the survey results, this research 
found that site security is another major factor for users using certain e-commerce in online shopping. It is as shown 
in the following figure: 
 
 
                                     
                                                                Figure 7. Result of Indicator of Site Security 
Based on Figure 7 above, 550 respondents answered strongly agree that the ability of e-commerce to maintain user's 
personal information is very important and becomes a major concern for users. The remaining 230 respondents 
answered agree with the statement. It shows that the security of personal information is an important thing that must 
be maintained by e-commerce companies, both through the security of website and app technology used and the ability 
of employees to protect users' data. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the research above, the conclusions of this study are as follows: 
1. Customization is the first important e-CRM factor to be considered by e-commerce businesses. Therefore, user 
interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designers' ability to design the appearance of e-commerce features is an 
important point in ensuring the continuity of a good e-CRM strategy in e-commerce. 
2. Care is the next e-CRM factor that e-commerce users in Indonesia highly consider. The ability of e-commerce 
customer service to solve user problems in a friendly and timely manner is an important thing in e-CRM through 
customer service 
3. Choice is the third important e-CRM factor to consider. In Indonesia users of e-commerce in Indonesia believe that 
the more choices of products and shops available in e-commerce, the more reliable the e-commerce will be and can 
help users choose the desired product options. Therefore, e-commerce needs to continue to look for new sellers or 
features of various product variants in order to maintain good relationships with users in using certain e-commerce 
4. Site security is the last e-CRM factor that e-commerce users in Indonesia most consider. E-commerce security in 
maintaining the privacy and user information provided in e-commerce is important in the e-CRM strategy.

Abstract 
The present research seeks to design and implement an ergonomic improvement in the roll-forming station of a metal-
mechanical company, where the incidence rate for low back pain is 29.4%. The methodology used to evaluate the 
situation prior to the improvement was the NIOSH equation, where the risk of injury was found to be 3.30 at the origin 
and 3.57 at the destination. According to NIOSH benchmarks, these factors constitute a high risk of injury and urgent 
intervention. Following the design and implementation of the improvement, the NIOSH equation was again used to 
demonstrate the decrease in risk presented by the operation. An improvement of 81.5% in the rate of lifting at the 
origin and 73.4% at the destination was achieved. The research presented validity in the NIOSH equation, helping to 
corroborate the effectiveness obtained by the design and implementation of an ergonomic improvement, thus reducing 
the probability of injury,and increasing job satisfaction.

1. Introduction
The design of ergonomic workstations improves productivity of operations and generates an adequate environment 
for management of occupational safety, the main element of any design should bethe human factor (Torres and 
Rodriguez, 2021). In manufacturing companies, the incidence rate of low back pain related to diseases caused by 
exposure, repetition and intensity of overexertion is one of the most recurrent symptoms (Neusa-Arenas et al. 2020). 
In the case study presented, a high rate of low back injuries was identified in a specific area of the production plant, a 
bad design of the workstation was diagnosed,and a solution is proposed under an ergonomic improvement. The task 
identified is a manual load handling operation that involves constantly picking up and moving heavy materials from 
one position to another. The area where this workstation is located is the roll forming area. The production line 
generates a coarse chip that is collected in a steel tray and then transferred to the compressor, where a compact block 
of metal is formed.

Looking at the table, the lifting rates of both the origin and destination are in the ""Low Risk"" category. This means 
that, after implementing the hydraulic table improvement, the objective was met and the risk of injury was reduced 
from ""High Risk"", where changes were urgently needed, to ""Low Risk"". The lifting rate at origin improved by 81.5%, 
while that at destination improved by 73.4%. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The purpose of this work was to find a solution to the problem found, which dealt with ergonomic failures in the 
profiling workstation. Through different methods and instruments, the risk of lumbar injury of the operators in the 
mentioned area was reduced. Also, job satisfaction was increased, and this was verified after surveying workers at 
workstation. 
 
Using the revised NIOSH equation, it was possible to measure the risk of injury before and after the implementation 
of the improvement, which was significantly reduced, and improved by 81.5% at the starting position and 73.4% at 
the destination. Some limitations found throughout the study were the suitability of the hydraulic table for the 
workstation, as it needed to be relatively small and easy to maneuver, and the initial investment of the table, which 
will eventually reduce visits to the physician and save costs.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly had a huge impact on the sustainability of performance in every industry in 
Indonesia. The impact does not only affect the economy on the company, but also the level of stress on employees as part 
of the company. The shift of the work system from WFO to WFH is a challenge for companies and workers alike, where 
they have to adapt to unexpected situations very quickly. Bringing all responsibilities to their respective homes is certainly 
not that easy. Starting from decreased motivation, increased workload, to causing all productivity to decrease along with 
the implementation of WFH. Research method with Systematic Literature Review (SLR). SLR is a way of identifying, 
evaluating, and interpreting all available research that is relevant to the formulation of the problem or topic area being 
studied. Job stress is a reaction that cannot be prevented by someone and is a reaction to the burden that is obtained. The 
stress factors themselves include workload, role ambiguity, working environment, and working relationship.

1. Introduction
At the beginning of 2020, almost every country in all parts of the world faced the same issue, namely a new virus that we 
now know as Covid-19. This virus originally emerged from a city in China named Wuhan (Burhanuddin and Abdi, 2020). 
The spread of this virus cannot be stopped so that it begins to spread to all corners of the world, including Indonesia itself. 
The first case in Indonesia was announced in late February. The government has started to designate the Covid-19 virus as 
a Covid-19 National Disaster Emergency (Fitri  2020). The government's policy in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has 
an impact on all lives, including the world of work. Until now, no one has been able to predict when the Covid-19 pandemic 
will end (Pakpahan  2020). A simple way to adapt and deal with this pandemic is to prepare short-term and long-term 
strategies. Almost all activities have been suspended, and this policy is called a lockdown (Rezki and Yunus  2020). Almost 
all companies have to implement a work from home system (Work From Home). The shift of the work system from Work 
From Office to Work From Home is a challenge for companies and workers alike, where they have to adapt in unexpected 
situations very quickly. This of course makes both parties are not sufficiently prepared to carry all the responsibilities that 
are usually done from behind the walls of the office to their respective homes. 
It has been more than a year that many companies have adapted the work from home system where employees are getting 
used to a work environment that is 180 degrees different from previous years (Perdana  2020). Working from home produces 
several impacts that are felt by companies and employees themselves (Ma'rifah  2020). Productivity in working at home is 
considered not as good as when working in the office (Ma'rifah  2020). When employees work from home, the setting where 
they work automatically becomes their own place of residence, the bad impact will be that employees can be lazy because 
the atmosphere of the house is considered comfortable (Mustajab et al.  2020) in (Ma'rifah  2020) . In addition, due to 
working from home, employees are considered to get more assignments or job descriptions than usual (Ma'rifah  2020). A 
large workload makes employees feel depressed and stressed (Chandra & Adriansyah, 2017). Research conducted by Puci 
et al.  (2020) shows that employees who experience emotional psychological stress related to the pandemic are hit hard 
because their work environment requires them to live side by side with COVID-19. 
Stress levels also automatically spike when we face new situations and are forced to adapt quickly. Work stress has an 
understanding or definition as a feeling of pressure experienced by employees in dealing with work (Saputri & Wahyuwati

Abstract 
For decades, Indonesia has a tourism industry that greatly helps the development of several regions, but the coronavirus-
19 pandemic that came in early 2020 could instantly kill the entire tourism industry in various regions. For more than a 
year the government is looking for ways to revive the tourism industry in various regions to save the economy of the 
affected communities. The purpose of this study is to find and provide the best input to the state of the tourism industry 
post-pandemic. Research methods that will be implemented in the form of information and science are academic and 
various research in similar industries. in this study will also be associated with several phenomena that occur during the 
pandemic so that it can connect the relationship between the circulating phenomenon with the basic theory. The results of 
this study became a literature review of information and innovation in the tourism industry and became one of the 
foundations for future research.

Abstract 
At the end of the year 2019, the world has been faced with New Coronavirus Pandemic, and it affected people’s lives, 
the environment, the economy, and businesses in different sectors. During the pandemic, many sectors and businesses 
tried to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic and tried to turn crises into opportunities. The textile sector -
which has a big share in Turkey’s economy in terms of export and production volume- was affected during the 
pandemic. This study aims to analyze the economic impacts of the New Coronavirus Pandemic and yearly based 
comparison analyses on the textile sector in Bursa, Turkey. Two questionnaires containing twenty-four questions were 
applied to 241 textile companies in Bursa. Data were analyzed with SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 
25.0 software. Analysis results showed that most of the participants have negative opinions in terms of the economy, 
and they have economic worries post-COVID-19. Tested hypotheses also showed the significant differences between 
operation year, legal status, the market of businesses, and the monthly turnover of companies and how they were 
affected by COVID-19. Internationally serving and operating for many years, corporations or limited companies have 
an advantage and less negative opinion. Study results also pointed out increased lead time of raw material and delivery 
time in 2021 compared to 2019.

1. Introduction
Many epidemics and disasters have occurred throughout history and affected humanity. Beyond old ones such as 
Black Plague (14th century), the Spanish Flu (1918-20), and shortly SARS, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, and Ebola respectively 
affected humanity (Alaeddinoglu and Rol  2020). Recently Coronavirus emerged in the world. On 31 December 2019, 
the WHO (World Health Organization) was announced cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province 
of China. On March 11, 2020, the WHO informed “Coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) as a global pandemic. 
Unfortunately, over 200 countries were under the influence of the pandemic (WHO 2020). Because of the pandemic, 
6,098,941 million people have lost their lives in the cases of 470,207,646 up to the end of the 20th of March in 2022 
(Worldometer  2022). 
The new Coronavirus Pandemic affected people’s lives, working styles, the economy, and different sectors. The textile 
sector, which is one of the affected sectors, had the highest foreign trade surplus and contributes to over 10% of the 
country’s gross domestic product in Turkey (Uyanık and Çelikel 2019). In 2019, Turkey's carpet, ready-made clothing, 
and apparel, textile, and raw materials export 28 billion in U.S. dollars and make 16% of the total country's exports. 
But decreased by 1 billion USD to 27 billion USD in 2020, accounting for 18% of total country exports (Textile 
Industry Analysis Report and Guide for TRB1 Region 2021). Increased and disrupted transportation days, increased 
raw material lead time and costs, decreased orders, and reduction of operation capacities due to social distance affected 
the textile sector negatively. But also, new product opportunities and production areas were raised due to the 
contagious nature of the pandemic. Companies that adopt quickly, use technology more, and have a chance to start

According to Table 7, the 2021 year results revealed an increased average lead time. The average lead time of raw 
material was 21-30 days with 0.4% of participants in 2019 but reached 35.3% of participants in 2021. While average 
delivery time was mostly 21-30 days in 2019 but reached 31-40 days in 2021. These are mostly related to disrupted 
and delayed transportation and shortage of raw materials during the pandemic.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations
In this study, the Coronavirus Pandemic impact on the textile sector in Bursa, Turkey was analyzed. SPSS 25 software 
was used for the analysis. To analyze the economic impact on the textile sector, three subsets; COVID-19 effect on 
the sustainability of economic activities, opinions on economic policies implemented in COVID-19, and economic 
forecasts for post-COVID-19 analyzed. In terms of the sustainability of economic activities, most of the participants 
thought of decreasing the number of employees working at the company. In the scope of economic policies 
implemented during COVID-19, participants pointed out they couldn’t profit from the benefits which were given and 
taken precautions were not sufficient. They also thought economic recovery will take a long time and inflation and 
unemployment will increase post-COVID-19. These opinions revealed that the textile sector in Bursa was affected 
negatively in terms of the economy and participants have economic worries for post-COVID-19. To mitigate negative 
effects and stimulate the economy after the pandemic, economic support packages of states have gained importance 
and should be better prepared.  
Developed hypotheses were also tested and analyzed. Results showed that companies were affected differently 
according to their operation year. 21 and above years operating companies had a less negative opinion. That can be 
related to their experience and knowledge about how to manage a crisis. Companies were affected differently 
according to their legal status and their market. The sole proprietorship has more negative opinions about pandemics, 
so the importance of being institutional became apparent during the pandemic. Internationally serving companies have 
fewer negative opinions than national and local ones. Results showed that companies were affected differently 
according to their monthly turnover. In the years 2019 and 2021 firms whose monthly turnover is less than 1,000,000, 
TL have a more negative opinion. That was probably related to the size of the company. Companies that have less 
turnover were affected more negatively. This study’s results showed the effects of some important characteristics of 
companies against the pandemic. Internationally serving and operating for many years, corporations or limited 
companies have an advantage and less negative opinion. 
In the final stage, different criteria, such as monthly operation capacity, the average number of monthly employees, 
average delivery time, and average lead time, were compared based on years. Participants pointed out that average 
delivery time and average lead time significantly increased. Increased deadlines and delivery times related to the 
pandemic resulted in disrupted transportation activities, decreased working capacity, and lockdowns. But, compared 
to 2019, in the 2021 monthly operation capacity, the average number of monthly employees increased in the textile 
sector in Bursa. This can be related to increased production volume and the development of the textile sector in Bursa.

Results showed that despite the pandemic’s negative impact on average delivery time, average lead time, and 
participant’s negative opinions related to COVID-19 economic impact, most of the criteria, such as monthly operation 
capacity, the average number of monthly employees, export volume developed in Bursa textile sector. This also 
coincides with the results of the Turkish Exporters Assembly (2022), from 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021, 
Bursa had 1.19 billion $ export in the textile sector, also increased export volume by 32.2% in 2021 compared to 2020. 
In Turkey and around the world, related questionnaire studies revealed negative impacts of the pandemic on the 
economy, production volume, increased lead times, workload, and stress level of employees in the textile sector and 
also in other sectors. But, studies pointed out the increased importance of using technology, having digital skills, and 
being agile during the pandemic. With a good experience of the pandemic, companies can allocate more budget to use 
technology more, improve their digital skills also transition to institutionalization. The limitation of the study is that 
it has conducted with a sample from only one city in Turkey. Researchers can do similar questionnaires by increasing 
the number of sampled cities. Employees and managers in textile sectors can also conduct similar studies and realize 
their deficiencies in terms of pandemic effect, and they can prepare action plans in case of facing similar pandemics, 
diseases, or disasters.

Abstract 
Non-renewable resources are being depleted at a faster rate and consequently can cause a strong asymmetry in 
marginalized cities and towns, a resource as vital as water is a gift of nature that is not valued as it deserves, and the 
lack of it can be a high-risk factor causing serious economic, social, and health problems (UNHCR 2019). That is why 
the research objective is to design an industrial application model for the capture of atmospheric water, focused 
especially on agribusinesses in Mexico City. The design of the model is based on the models of Cloud Seeding (Super 
and Heimbach 1983) and Fog Trapping (Bautista et al. 2018), applying the analytical mechanics model (Zayas 2019). 
The main contribution of this research is that the proposal of this model supports the fulfillment of three Sustainable 
Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda: SDG 2. Zero Hunger; SDG 6. Clean Water and Sanitation and SDG 9. 
Responsible Consumption and Production.

1. Introduction
Over time, agribusinesses have had to develop and innovate their processes to be competitive; it is vitally important 
to seek and promote numerous opportunities for generating employment and income. The demographic growth of the 
world's population obliges this sector to ensure that the land is used, and that the product obtained from it is of better 
quality coupled with the satisfaction of demand (IICA  2017). 
It is worth mentioning that agribusiness has an enormous potential to employ the rural population by combating 
poverty in rural and urban communities (FAOAquastat  2014) which is not only at the agricultural level, but there are 
alsoseveral opportunities, derived from processing, handling, marketing, and transportation. Agribusiness has a strong 
economic impact on the world. However, less than 3% of the world's water is fresh, and only 0.5% is used to meet all 
human needs (UN  2021), including agribusiness, since, on average, agriculture uses 70% of the water withdrawn in 
the world, and agricultural activities account for an even higher proportion of ""consumptive water use"" due to crop 
evapotranspiration. Globally, more than 330 million hectares are irrigated. Irrigated agriculture accounts for 20% of 
the total cultivated area and contributes 40% of the world's total food production (World Bank 2021), making the 
increasingly excessive use of the vital liquid and the infrastructure needed to manage it highly costly, aggravating 
global scarcity (UN  2021).

Therefore, the Model to determine the level of humidity Cloud Seeding for Agribusiness expresses the following 
results:it is estimated that an average of 10% of the water will be captured by cloud bombardment, and 10% by fog 
capture. Analyze which technique generates greater benefits for agribusiness Ho hypothesis test. 
 
6. Conclusion  
According to the documentary research, we propose the design of a device that efficiently allows the collection of 
water, that is, without using Silver Iodide (add a conclusive figure, the good thing about this model is and add 
comparative analysis advantages and disadvantages), significantly decreasing the operating costs and increasing the 
amount of water collected through the conditions of pressure, temperature and relative humidity in agribusinesses 
located in Mexico City. 
 
In this way, we actively contribute to the fulfillment of three of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are:  SDG 
2. Zero Hunger, due to obtaining the expected harvests to meet current and future demand without interruptions in the 
supply chain, SDG 6. Clean Water and Sanitation, facilitating access to atmospheric water in indigenous peoples and 
marginalized areas, not only for domestic use but with a business approach since up to 70% of the water used in the 
world is used for irrigation. SDG 9. Responsible Production and Consumption, population growth exerts a strong 
pressure and demand for available resources, which is why we must optimize available resources to maintain the 
current lifestyle.

Abstract 
Food waste is a significant problem in modern society. It is well documented that about one-third of the food produced 
globally is lost or wasted, harming the firms’ economic, environmental, and social sustainability.  This problem is 
evident in supermarkets and restaurants, which are the most important wasters after households and agriculture. In 
most cases, supermarkets use new technologies to manage expiry dates, tackle food waste via implementing dynamic 
pricing and encourage customers to buy near-to-expired over fresher products. However, these practices are not 
sufficient to guarantee the achievement of sustainability. Supermarkets need to cooperate with more parties such as 
their counterparts (other supermarkets), restaurants, online selling platforms, fertilizer producers, and charities besides 
their general customers. This study introduces a framework that uses blockchain-based smart contracts to manage the 
cooperation between supermarkets and other parties with the goal of reducing food waste and seeking to achieve 
sustainable targets. A smart contract is an appealing feature of blockchain technology to facilitate and automatically 
execute the terms of an agreement once the specified conditions are met. We analyze the benefits that a smart contract 
grants to supermarkets to manage food waste in a sustainable way.

1. Introduction
Food waste leads to significant environmental impact in terms of inefficient use of natural resources as well as an 
economic cost and also social and moral implications (Mattsson et al. 2018). Although 795 million people suffer from 
undernourishment, it is estimated that almost one-third of the food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted 
globally. So, it is an issue of importance to global food security (FAO 2011; FAO 2015). Food production causes 
greenhouse gas emissions along the entire food supply chain and wasting food means that those emissions are 
produced in vain (Scholz et al. 2015). Figure (1) estimates the percentage distribution of wasted food generation in 
the United States excluding the industrial sector based on the report of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA). The supermarkets have a share of 14% in generating food waste which is noticeable. For supermarkets, there 
is a need for a change in waste management methods. 
A regular way to manage defective items is selling them at a lower price which most the retailers are using considering 
the salvage value per defective item (Vishkaei et al. 2014; Maleki Vishkaei et al. 2014; Farhangi et al. 2015). 
Moreover, there are various types of traditional inventory control models that consider assumptions such as discounts 
and destructive testing acceptance sampling that are beneficiary for managing inventory levels (Pasandideh et al. 2014; 
Maleki Vishkaei et al. 2019). One of the food waste reduction practices is a collaboration with external partners, 
including restaurants and food banks. Those partners source from the supermarket's products that the supermarkets 
are unwilling to sell anymore, for two reasons. The first reason is that the products might almost have reached their 
expiration date and spoil, and they might look not quite perfect anymore. The second reason is that there might be too 
much stock in the store to be sold before the products reach their expiration date. But, collaborating with external 
partners usually leads to additional work for the managers (Moser 2020). Moreover, a collaboration between different 
parties including supermarkets, restaurants, small food services, and even consumers makes the operational activities 
become more complex (Almeida Oroski 2020). Using new technologies such as smart contracts can be helpful to 
manage these issues.

Based on the selling agreements which are shown in table (3), the supermarket revenue increases from 302.5 euros 
(when it does not use the new platform) to 383.02 euros. Moreover, the wasted apples from 35 kg reduce to zero kg. 
It should be mentioned that the example that is provided in this section is related to only one product and the new 
platform can be used for all the products that exist in the supermarket. In that case, the amount of products that are 
being sold or donated using smart contracts will be noticeable. Therefore, using the new technologies including 
blockchain and smart contracts can help the supermarkets to have more cooperation with other parties in an agile way 
which leads to mitigating the food waste and increasing the revenue for all of the parties. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this paper, the application of smart contracts for making decisions regarding the surplus inventories at the 
supermarkets is studied. A sample algorithm is developed to check the proper conditions for executing agreements 
between the supermarket and other parties including minimarkets, restaurants, online stores, and charities at the 
beginning of each quality period to avoid food waste and increase the revenue of the supermarket at the end of the 
evaluation period. The quality periods are categorized based on the expiration dates of the products and the selling 
price will reduce when the quality level decreases. To automatically execute agreements, the system considers various 
factors such as the prices that are offered by different parties, the inventory levels, discount rate, donation rate, and 
the rank or priority of the parties when they offer identical prices for the products. This platform can help all of the 
parties to provide for their needs at a reasonable price and avoid food waste. Making decisions about the surplus 
inventories when they have a higher quality would be more efficient rather than trying to sell them when they have 
poor quality.  
 
In future research, different scenarios and algorithms can be examined to find proper strategies for executing the terms 
of agreements between the supermarket and other parties considering specified conditions. Moreover, a cost-benefit 
analysis can be done for implementing a smart contract platform as well as the possibility of outsourcing its 
implementation, maintenance, and monitoring to a third-party company.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 provides a lot of changes to the development of technology and business. In this Industrial Age, business 
people are given a new opportunity to build their business using advanced technology. Thus there will be many benefits 
in the Industrial era and of course there will also be various problems and threats that can occur. Business forms related 
to Industry 4.0 can be such as Digital Marketing, E-Business, E-Commerce, and E-Marketing, while related software 
forms can be such as Industrial Control System (ICS), Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA), and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore, in doing business in the industry, it is necessary to apply the correct business 
ethics to avoid the destructive impacts that can occur. In this study, the Systematic Literature Review method was used 
to analyze how the industrial world supports business ethics and identify what threats, problems, and challenges can be 
faced in industry 4.0 by applying laws and provisions in business ethics. This research produces an analysis of business 
activities in E-business, ethical issues in E-Marketing and several challenges that can threaten business ethics in 
Industry 4.0.

Abstract 
To find out what factors significantly affect consumer loyalty in using e-marketplaces and what methods can be 
used to obtain loyalty data. Technological developments play a major role in humans and have a changing impact 
on the business world. Electronic commerce today is known to continue to increase every year and this is realized 
by the increasing number of developments in information technology. Consumer loyalty in using e-marketplace 
applications can be observed from the actions taken repeatedly in using the same application. The research method 
used in this study is to use a systematic literature review on research journals published in 2017–2021 with three 
research questions and use 11 journals to conduct further analysis and discussion. The results obtained based on 
11 journals that have been analyzed state that there are various factors that influence consumer loyalty and e-
service quality is the most significant and most discussed factor and the data collected mostly uses quantitative 
methods.

Consumer Loyalty, E – marketplace, Systematic Literature Review. 
1. Introduction
Technological developments play a major role in humans and have an impact on changes in the business world, 
especially in e-commerce (Rakhmat Romadhan et al. 2019). There has been a development in the trade sector 
which was initially carried out conventionally and gradually transitioned to digital. This is the basis for the 
emergence of the e-commerce industry which acts as an intermediary for sellers and buyers to conduct transactions 
(Suleman 2018). E-commerce is the process of buying and selling products using electronic data via the internet 
(Grandon and Pearson  2004). E-commerce can help consumers buy goods quickly and can be done anytime and 
anywhere if they have an internet connection to connect them (Erawati  2020; Puji Lestari 2018) 
Electronic commerce is currently known to continue to increase every year and this is realized from the increasing 
number of developments in information and communication technology and infrastructure networks for better 
communication in Indonesia (Lukito  2017). When comparing e-commerce with other traditional business models, 
e-commerce has great advantages. This can be seen from the automation of the entire process, including the
transportation of goods and services, so as to reduce costs (Phani Bhaskar & Prasanna Kumar 2016). Covid-19 is
one of the events that has an impact on the global economy. Several economic sectors in Indonesia have
experienced a decline such as the export and import industry, but the e-commerce sector has experienced rapid
growth due to people who tend to be interested in shopping online to avoid the spread of the virus and as an effort
to implement health protocols (Ayu & Lahmi  2020; Indarthi et al.  2015). In 1995 in the United States was the
beginning of the establishment of a marketplace that began with the emergence of E-bay and Amazon, then in
1998 appeared Paypal. In China, it started with the emergence of Alibaba in 1999. In Indonesia itself, the
marketplace has existed since 1996. This was marked by the establishment of Dyviacom Intrabumi or D-Net,
which at that time acted as a pioneer in online transactions (Prasetyo Budi Widagdo  2016) Some examples from
markets in Indonesia such as Tokopedia, Shopee, Lazada, Blibli, Bukalapak and so on. (Widyayanti  2019)
Intangible assets are the definition of customer loyalty which is still significant for many companies (Jiang and 
Zhang  2016). Thakur (2016) defines attitudinal loyalty as a customer's intention to remain committed to a 
particular provider in the market by repeating their purchase experience. Marketing scholars have given different 
meanings to the definition of customer loyalty (Ali et al.  2016). while Casidy and Wymer (2016) conceptualized 
customer loyalty as a feeling of attachment aimed at the object of loyalty, rather than repeated commercial

Based on 11 journals that have been found, most of them use quantitative methods. Three of the eleven journals 
found used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. One journal uses a qualitative method. And the 
remaining seven journals use quantitative methods. Collecting data for research in journals that use quantitative 
methods is by distributing questionnaires and processing the data. Meanwhile, in journals that use qualitative 
methods, Data collection is obtained by analyzing the results of research from previously conducted journals or 
other data obtained from the internet. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the research that has been done, it can be seen that the systematic literature review research 
method can be used to analyze consumers in the e-commerce industry and provide comprehensive analysis results. 
From the research that has been done, it can be concluded as follows: 
1. Found factors that influence customer loyalty, namely the existence of e-service quality, trust from customers,
e-satisfaction, brand image owned, advertising, price discounts, brand equity, value equity, perception of price,
convenience of services provided, as well as corporate image.
2. The most significant factor influencing customer loyalty is e-service quality which is the factor with the most
contribution.
3. The research method that is focused on examining customer loyalty factors is mostly quantitative methods.
However, there are several studies that also use quantitative methods or a combination of both.
The limitations experienced when creating this systematic literature review were based on a generally limited set 
of key words, and using the Google Scholar database to compile journal papers from 2017 to 2021. 
7. Suggestion
From the conclusions that have been made, the following are suggestions that we can give for further research: 
1. The next systematic literature review would be better if using topics that have a larger number of samples and
topics that are easier to find so that more data can be obtained.
2. E-commerce in Indonesia must prioritize and focus on the e-service quality provided in order to increase or
maintain the loyalty of its customers.

Abstract 
In recent years, Indonesia’s economy is growing rapidly but the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic that hit the world at 
the end of 2019 paralyzed all economic activities all over the world. The improving conditions have made economic 
activities around the world recover and are in the process of repairing and renewing the economic system towards 
sustainable economy. As well as the textile industry in Indonesia, but the problems in this industry are not only from 
the pandemic but also from the quality of human resources in Indonesia which is still classified as low. Therefore, this 
study aims to examine the relationship between the quality of human resources and investment in Indonesia’s textile 
industry. The Resource Based View theory from the Competitive Advantage theory is used to explain the existing 
data. This research used secondary data to support the arguments of this study. After several attempts have been made 
in this research, there are some interesting things that need to be discussed further regarding the quality of human 
resources and increasing investment in the textile industry in Indonesia. 
Keywords 
Indonesia textile competitiveness, Textile investment, Textile manpower competitiveness 
1. Introduction
The Textile industry is one of the most important sectors in Indonesia. As the population increases in Indonesia, the 
need for textile products is also increasing (Hermawan and Msi 2011). Currently, Indonesia is included in the top 10 
largest textile producing countries and is ranked 12th for textile exporting countries (Mordor Intelligence, 2019). The 
Indonesian government is also currently trying to develop the manufacturing industry including the textile industry 
with various policies that can attract foreign investment (Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia, 2019). 
This sector absorbs a workforce of around 1.4 million workers which is predicted to increase every year (Badan Pusat 
Statistik, 2019). With the large number of workers absorbed in this industry, the quality of HR is one of the aspects 
that needs to be considered to develop this industry. 
The debate about the importance of human resources to increase company productivity and efficiency has been in the 
public spotlight for several decades. Human labor is believed to be one of the main foundations of the company to 
improve its performance and to be able to compete in the global realm. Especially in the era of globalization, human 
labor greatly helps companies to gain a competitive advantage (HASSAN and MAHMOOD  2016). Quality human 
resources can be seen from the experience, ability to judge and intelligence of workers. Quoting from Wright (2006), 
quality human resources can increase the technical value of the company itself. Majeed's (2014) in his writings, 
companies can increase their foreign investment indirectly by improving the quality of HR in their companies. The 
relationship between foreign investment and the quality of human resources is a novelty that has become a factor of 
economic growth. According to Gunja Baranwal (2011) human resources have a positive impact on the country’s 
economy. The quality of Indonesia's HR is still low when compared to most countries in ASEAN. Data taken by the 
World Bank in 2020, Indonesia is ranked 96th out of 174 countries listed in the data. When viewed from the 10 
ASEAN countries counted in this data, Indonesia is ranked 6th out of 10 countries with an HCI value of 0.54. Raya 
and Suryadarma (2013) in her book entitled Human Capital Formation and Economic Growth in Asia and the Pacific 
also talks about human resources, the majority of which still do not have basic abilities such as talent, mathematical 
ability and English language skills which have become an international language since several decades ago. Rachmi 
(2013) Indonesian labor conditions currently adopted by textile companies in Indonesia, especially medium and small 
sized companies, make Indonesian workers less competitive than other countries. This makes the company's foreign 
investment less than optimal.

The Indonesia-EFTA Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IE-CEPA) is also one of the Indonesian 
government's efforts to increase foreign investment and open market access to EFTA members (Switzerland, Norway, 
Liechtenstein, Iceland) and partner countries of the EFTA. This agreement was agreed by both parties to increase 
market access and increase the competitiveness of products in various industries and sectors, one of which is textiles 
(Manurung 2020). In addition to focusing on products, this agreement also provides opportunities for workers in 
Indonesia to work in EFTA countries to seek new experiences so as to improve the quality of Indonesian HR. With 
this, the qualifications in the RBV theory can be helped to fulfill with experience and gain skills that are not obtained 
by working in the country. 
 
In RBV theory, one of the qualifications needed to make humans good human resources is to have skills that are not 
easy to imitate and cannot be imitated perfectly. With a low level of human resource quality, every skill possessed by 
the workforce is very easy to imitate, so to avoid this the company requires training and screening of workers to 
increase the competitiveness and productivity of the company to attract new investors. Companies can implement On 
the Job Training (OTJ) programs that are tailored to the skills needed such as making new innovations, carrying out 
basic work and so on. International Labour Organization conducted a programme called Better Work in Indonesia that 
already enter its third phases and will ended in June 2022. This programme was created with the aims of improving 
the compliance of the companies towards the labour standard and also increase Indonesian textile industry in global 
supply chains. Focusing on sustainable solutions, Better Work in Indonesia held several training sessions that could 
easily accessed by every manpower in Indonesia. By this mean, ILO and its partner encouraging every factory or 
company owner to sign up to this special training course.  
 
6. Conclusion  
From the explanation of the data above, HR has an important role to increase the competitiveness of companies both 
nationally and globally. The quality of human resources has an important role in increasing the value of the company 
which will indirectly increase incoming investment due to the increased productivity and efficiency of the company. 
The quality of Indonesian human resources is still low, there are many gaps to improve the productivity, skills, abilities 
and capabilities of these workers so that training and conditions from the company play an important role in improving 
the quality of human resources. Efforts to improve the quality of human resources itself can be done by providing 
periodic training that is appropriate for each different group of existing human resources to improve the capabilities, 
skills and values of the human resources themselves and carry out regular control over the level of ability and skills 
to increase worker productivity. Especially for the Indonesian textile and textile product industry, which absorbs a lot 
of labor and is an industry that is expected to be superior and help the country's economy in the future and can develop 
and increase its level of competitiveness in the international sphere. This research is expected to be an aid for the 
Government to pay more attention to the textile industry, especially small and medium-sized companies as well as in 
designing new policies regarding further improving the quality of human resources to prepare future generations for 
global changes. This research is also expected to help the development of the textile industry which is one of the main 
sources of the Indonesian economy as well as the industry that absorbs the largest workforce to bounce back in the 
post-pandemic period.

Abstract 
The rapid globalization facilitates the transfer of culture and technology that leads people to create innovations. This study 
aims to determine the impact of South Korea's cultural diplomacy strategy, followed by Korean companies to conduct market-
seeking and then influence the food industry in Indonesia. Cultural Diplomacy and Market-seeking theory is used to explain 
the existing data. This study uses qualitative research methods, with secondary data from reports, news and previous study, 
while taking primary data collection through interviews with Indonesian food sellers. The findings show that South Korea's 
cultural diplomacy and the role of Korean companies in market-seeking have increased business opportunities, viewed by the 
escalating number of Korean restaurants and the consumption of Korean food in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Waste management is one of the biggest issues in achieving environmental sustainability in the world. This is because 
due to globalization, very fast environmental changes, both external and internal cannot be avoided. This encourages 
business people (Multinational Corporations) to pay attention to social problems in the host country. Indonesia as one 
of the developing countries and the country with the largest population in the world is also not spared from the issue 
of waste management. 
Table 1. Total Population of DKI Jakarta 
Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency for DKI Jakarta Province, the population of DKI Jakarta Province 
from 2019 - 2021 continues to increase, with the increasing number of residents of the city of Jakarta, the more waste 
is generated and affects the increase in the volume of waste in landfill (TPA) (Central Statistics Agency DKI Jakarta 
2021). Every year, the volume of Jakarta's waste is increasing (Information Media of The Porivncial Government of 
DKI Jakarta 2020). In directly shows that the waste management in DKI Jakarta by the DKI Jakarta Provincial 
Government has not been managed properly (Mulyadin et.al 2018). In connection with this, quoted from the 2018 
Indonesian Environmental Statistics Catalog related to Waste Management in Indonesia, it is stated that from the 
results of the 2017 Social Security Module Susenas, only 1.2 percent of the people recycle household waste, and 8.7 
percent of the people carry bags. as a way to reduce waste, while 66.8 percent of the community still burns waste as a

the community and the surrounding environment. This concept provides an understanding that it is not enough for a 
company to make a profit, but must also make a positive contribution to the local community and take part in 
preserving the environment. 
 
From what has been described above, the research contribution by the author is to provide knowledge about the results 
of the author's research in examining the implementation of PT. Unilever Indonesia's CSR activities on the strategies 
and policies of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government in dealing with waste management problems to align the 
Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

Project ""Schedule Is Different"" Why? and 
What Should Be Done About It?

Abstract 
The portion of projects in the industrial activity is growing. One major cause are the rapid changes of product and 
models which force more frequent conduct of development projects. In the short history of project management as a 
self stand discipline, it is well known that many projects fail to wholly meet their planned objectives. A major reason 
to this reality is that projects last time. Often, very long time. This results in knowledge deficiencies and high levels 
of uncertainties. To improve projects' performances, substantial efforts are invested in project control, which is 
aimed at assuring that the project meets its planned objectives within budget and no later than a specified deadline. 
Accordingly, schedule is a prime concern in project control. It had been observed, however, that 'schedule is 
different' in the sense that it is known that schedule (performance) indicators of methods for project control fail to 
provide good information. Here it is proposed that the cause for this shortcoming is the fundamental difference 
between costs and duration in projects. The duration of the project is determined by only a subset of its activities as 
oppose to the project's cost, which is the sum of the costs of its components. This is the notion of criticality: the 
critical path, or critical chain – project's duration is determined by its critical activities. A direct consequence of this 
distinction is that the analysis and evaluation of control data at the project level can be misleading. This issue is 
discussed and demonstrated. Moreover, schedule  and schedule control provide foremost input to the coordination of 
the project's operation – the synchronization between the various resources which are required for each activity. 
Hence, in this aspect, too, the relevant information should be developed and provided at the activity level. In 
response, it is argued that project control data should be processed, analyzed and evaluated at the activity level. A 
framework to implement this approach is proposed and its benefits are discussed.

Abstract 
This research intends to examine how CSR that held by Danone-AQUA can support the implementation of SDGs in 
Indonesia, and how the first bottled water companies in Indonesia actually help to reduce plastic waste. Danone-
AQUA also supports environmental sustainability in Indonesia to minimize plastic waste, which is in line with the 
goals of the Indonesia Government that trying to reduce plastic waste by 70% in 2025 by implementing the 
#BijakBerplastik program in Indonesia. Theory used in this research is the CSV concept, and the method uses 
qualitative descriptive methods with secondary data collection. The findings in this research explain that CSR is not 
only improving the company's image, but can also help preserve Indonesia's environment and also build the shared 
value for the society and partners involved. 
Keywords 
Corporate Social Responsibility, Plastic Waste, Green Systems, Danone-AQUA, and CSV. 
1. Introduction
In the early 21st century, the issue of plastic waste has become a most trending topic of discussion. Because, not only 
having a practice packaging, cheap and easy to find, but plastic is a type of waste that is difficult to decompose and 
can cause serious problems for the environmental health of society. This is because plastic waste takes 20 years to 
decompose in the soil, and instead, it can even take 100 years, and thus making soil fertility not optimal. And if the 
plastic waste is scattered in the waters, it will be very difficult to decompose (Purwaningrum 2016). Plastic waste can 
also cause a natural disasters such as floods, and it’s also able to killing marine animals because they consider plastic 
bags are food, until they die because they cannot digest plastic properly (Environment Indonesia Center 2016). In this 
world, there are a lot of accumulation of plastic waste on land and sea that causes a country to have more attention 
and more action about reducing plastic waste. Indonesia are the second largest waste-producing country in the world 
after China, and the percentage of data from Ministry Of Environments and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia 
explains that within one year, Indonesia can produce 10.95 million pieces of plastic bag waste, and this amount is 
equivalent to an area of 65.7 hectares of plastic (Purwaningrum  2016). 
Seeing this serious issue, one of the largest Multinational Corporation (MNC) mineral bottled water companies in 
Indonesia, Danone-AQUA, are trying to implement a plastic waste recycling program called #BijakBerplastik. 
Danone-AQUA is part of the business group of one of the largest MNC companies in the food and beverage sector in 
the world, namely Danone-AQUA (Qona’ah 2019). Danone-AQUA is the first Bottled Drinking Water company in 
Indonesia, which was founded by Tirto Utomo in 1973. The first Danone-AQUA product in the form of a 950 ml glass 
bottle that sold in the market for Rp. 75.- in 1974 (Aqua n.d.). In order to improve the quality of its company, Danone-
AQUA put forward a CSR program to show a sense of care for the environment and public health. Because, 
considering that the main packaging of Danone-AQUA products is plastic base, Danone-AQUA at least helps 
minimize plastic waste on land and in the oceans that can pollute the environment. Companies that implement the 
CSR activities usually prioritize the resolution of issues such as factory closures, employee relations, human rights, 
corporate ethics, and community and environmental relations (Moir 2001). Those things actually leads to the 
profitability of the company and branding to the society, because the company will get a positive impact.

Interceptor001 has a very good function in preventing plastic waste from entering the sea, and besides that the 
interceptor also helps clean up garbage that is pooled in river areas. Interceptor001 is able to reduce 60% of plastic 
waste in rivers that will entering the ocean, and with this great system design, Interceptor 001 is able to collect 466 kg 
of waste in 24 hours, which means, Interceptor 001 is able to collect about 170 tons of waste per year in the river that 
leads to the sea (National Geographic Indonesia 2019). The collected waste will be sorted and recycled by other 
parties. The construction of Interceptor001 is also a form of Danone-AQUA's commitment to collect more plastic 
waste that has not been found in the ocean and river areas. Currently, Interceptor001 is only available at Drain 
Cengkareng, precisely at Pantai Indah Kapuk. 
 
In addition to the ""Interceptor001"" technology, Danone-AQUA also built another Green System, namely 
#BijakBerplastik water absorption well. In the construction of the system, Danone-AQUA collaborated with the West 
Java Provincial Government in realizing the infiltration wells to work optimally. The infiltration well has the main 
objective of overcoming the problem of flooding which now often occurs in many areas spread across West Java. The 
water absorption well is expected to help water infiltration and prevent run-off which is the main cause of flooding 
(Aqua 2021). Another goal of establishing the water absorption well is also a form of Danone-AQUA's commitment 
to support the supply of sustainable water resources in Indonesia. In the construction of water infiltration wells, 
Danone-AQUA also collaborates with IPB University in making an innovative design for the infiltration well design. 
Apparently, the water absorption well is made of 150 kg of non-economical plastic waste and is able to absorb 16,000 
liters of water (Aqua 2021). The plastic waste obtained is non-economical plastic waste and low economic value such 
as plastic packaging in supermarkets, food packaging plastic, and so on (Aqua 2021).  
 
From the data presented above, we argue that all of the green system-based infrastructure development efforts are a 
big effort deployed by Danone-AQUA to support the implementation of SDGs in Indonesia point 14. Interceptor 001 
will help improve environmental performance and be able to reduce plastic waste in the oceans, where basically the 
plastic waste can kill dozens of sea birds, marine mammals, fish that live in the ocean and can threaten the growth of 
marine life. If the oceans are filled with plastic waste, the Indonesian people will also be affected, such as natural 
disasters such as floods, and potentially consuming fish food that absorbs toxins from microplastic waste. Water 
infiltration wells that are built can also be a very innovative solution for Indonesia because they can prevent flooding 
and water resources can flow properly. Danone-AQUA believes that the system implemented can protect the 
Indonesian environment and support sustainable development in Indonesia. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of our analysis on the topic of SDGs implementation in Indonesia through the CSR Program run 
by Danone-AQUA, we are of the opinion that Danone-AQUA has proven to have made a major contribution to the 
implementation of SDGs points in Indonesia, especially points 12 and 14. This research has answered the question a 
research designed, where Danone-AQUA has been proven to help the implementation of SDGs in Indonesia through 
the #BijakBerplastik program which has been running since 2018. The data we have compiled shows that Danone-
AQUA is strategically aligned to implement SDGs points in Indonesia, through collaboration with partners such as 
building water absorption wells, developing education about the importance of plastic recycling, and building green 
system-based technology to tackle plastic waste in the ocean. The #BijakBerplastik program not only has a good 
impact on improving the company's image and economic value, but can create shared value for the parties involved, 
such as the community feeling good environmental changes because the percentage of plastic waste is reduced, and 
partners participating in the collaboration get balanced benefits. Therefore, this research is also very important because 
we provide a practical contribution to the topic of CSR in Indonesia and contribute to the development of research 
that will be researched in the future.

Abstract 
In this paper we consider a production and scheduling problem in a textile company. The company (namely Boyar 
Kimya) is located in Gaziantep city and producing dyeing, industrial yarns and fancy yarns. However, many problems 
are encountered during production scheduling due to the wide variety of products and also increasing demands for 
improved quality, customization, and shorter delivery lead times. When looking at the problems caused by production 
disruptions and misplanning, two major problems are occurred. While one of the aforementioned problems is high 
waiting times of machines due to the color control of yarns, another most common problem is missing or excess 
product weights that are not at the desired level. In this paper, the identified problems are analyzed and examined in 
detail. Bottlenecks are tried to be determined by using flow process charts. Finally, potential improvements are 
discussed and solution proposals are provided. In the future, the solution methodologies will be applied and the process 
will be rescheduled.

Abstract 
Firefighters can be considered one the most stressful occupations as they are often responding to emergencies in a 
time-constrained environment while frequently performing hazardous activities, and may even get complaints from 
the public when they are not satisfied. Firefighters’ missions are very sensitive and critical as their work is related to 
saving people and the environment from fire hazards. The nature of firefighters’ operation, which includes saving 
people, offering medical assistance, going through debris, etc. made “attention” to be an essential component in their 
work. If attention is lost while performing their decisions, this would lead to severe consequences for both people and 
property. One of the reasons of attention loss is to be under occupational stress. This paper explores the key factors of 
occupational stress among firefighters in Kuwait. The work is based on a series of interviews, which are engaged from 
the perspective of psychological contract, as a mean to explore the different areas that could be related to high stress 
levels among the firefighters in the region. The interviews use psychological contract as an exploratory tool that 
partially guides the dialogue among a series of potential factors in their lifestyle and work environment, expectations, 
etc. The collected data is analyzed on a one by one basis, to categorize and identify which of the topics discussed is 
more relevant as an occupational stressor for the firefighters. The results show that witnessing and experiencing 
traumatic events during missions, and fear of injuries are the top stressors among the firefighters in the region, and 
that perception regarding the presence of stressors is inversely correlated with age.

1. Introduction
Occupational stress could be defined as a harmful mental or physical response from the worker when faced to work 
demands that exceed or do not match his/her capabilities (NIOSH  1999). It creates an emotional and mental state of 
increased arousal that can impair the worker’s performance and have negative consequences for health (Wickens et 
al.  2021). Thus, occupational stress becomes a topic of care and study for Industrial Engineering in the area of Human 
Factors and Cognitive Ergonomics.  
Stress level is correlated to sleep duration, the capability of performing vigilant attention, higher workload (Jones et 
al  2022). Moreover, the incidence of occupational stress is becoming an increasingly recurrent problem in several 
countries around the globe, as the numbers of employees in a cross-sectional sample encompassing 116 countries 
world-wide are reporting higher levels of stress in their work environment (Gallup  2021). Additionally, regarding the 
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, it has been reported as containing the second highest percentage of 
daily anger conveyed by employees and the second highest percentage of daily sadness, just below the South Asia 
region. These values call for the attention of industrial engineers to investigate the problem: its potential sources and 
solutions. 
It is believed that human performance follows the pattern of an inverted U-shape when analyzed against stress level 
as postulated by the Yerkes Dodson Law presented in 1908 which is considered one of the oldest laws in behavioral 
research. This relationship has been extensively studied by many scientists and later updated for human performance 
in different styles, such as by Hancock and Ganey in 2003 when they proposed the extended U-shape. This generally 
accepted relationship-pattern followed between stress and performance is consistent with the affirmation of Wickens 
in 2021, that not all stress is always negative, because in low levels can serve as an invigorating source of motivation 
for the workers, but in larger amounts turns out to be harmful and deteriorates the worker’s performance, causing long

Then, the stressors found are the top 2 from table 2 above:  
a) Witnessing and experiencing traumatic events during missions (from topic 2, rank 1). 
b) Dangers inherent to missions (from topic 8, rank 2). 
The differences in perceptions between respondents are found by finding the average responses regarding perceived 
factors of stress for each individual respondent as shown in table 3:

A line can be plotted as shown in figure 1, to visualize a potential pattern in responses of firefighters about perceiving 
or noticing the presence of stressors, according to the different ages: 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Individual response averages regarding the perceived presence of stressors 
 
A linear model can be developed showing a negative slope when the variable in x axis increases (age), and the response 
in y axis (perception of the presence of stressors) decreases. This is consistent with the conversations obtained in the 
interviews, as the younger firefighters had a slight tendency to notice more details regarding accidents and traumatic 
events, and some comments made by the older firefighters developed around the concept of adaptability and 
‘resiliency’, which in their own words, is formed after a couple of years in service. The line in figure 1 above is:

(Eq. 1) 
With total error of 0.27, hence a correlation between stressor perception and age exists as mentioned in the literature 
by Mi-Suk et al in 2012. 
 
6. Conclusions and Validations 
The following two stressors are identified in firefighters in Kuwait, as shown in the top 2 of table 2: 
Stressor 1: Witnessing and experiencing traumatic events during missions (from topic 2, rank 1). 
Stressor 2: Dangers inherent to missions and likelihood of injury (from topic 8, rank 2).

Regarding the 6 stressors reported in the literature by Allison et al in 2022, which were contained in our interviews in 
topics 1, 6, 7, 8, 15 and 18, we found that 5 were reported with high consideration (Quartile 1) or medium consideration 
(Quartile 2) by Kuwaiti firefighters, with the exception of ‘psychosocial stress’, which was analogous to topic 1 in our 
interviews: relation with the public, which was found with low consideration (Quartile 3). This show consistent 
findings and proves that the cultural differences between firefighters to what is considered a stressor and what is not, 
is not an important factor to make a distinction. This supports the idea the that findings from other studies performed 
for samples of firefighters could be utilized too in the Middle East, regardless of the cultural differences. 
 
As a final conclusion, there is a slight inverse correlation between firefighter’s age and their perceptions about the 
presence of stress factors as shown in figure 1 and equation 1. Also, in our interviews the older firefighters discussed 
more about adaptability and resiliency being formed during the first couple of years of service, and these findings are 
consistent with Mi-Suk et al in 2012, which are also well documented by others. It appears that the correlation remains 
true in Kuwait regardless of the cultural differences between Korean firefighters and Kuwait firefighters.

Abstract 
This paper solves the Renewable Energy Integration Problem (REIP) by finding the optimum component 
configuration of a hybrid microgrid, as a system constituted of solar panels, wind turbines, electric batteries, converters 
and diesel generators to provide electricity in an off-grid scenario in the Middle East region. The work operates a 
Monte-Carlo simulation to allow the random changes in weather to be considered in the evaluation of any 
predetermined set of components, which are in turn encoded as a sequence of values compatible with a Genetic 
Algorithm and Firework Algorithm. Furthermore, a Genetic Algorithm is implemented to optimize the component 
configuration of the hybrid microgrid, and consecutively a Firework Algorithm is also applied to benchmark the 
solution to the same problem. The paper compares the solutions and performance achieved by the 2 heuristic 
optimization algorithms for finding the optimal component configuration in 3 versions of the Renewable Energy 
Integration Problem: Version A the micro-grid is restricted to use fossil fuel sources only: diesel generators, converters 
and batteries. In version B the microgrid is restricted to use renewable sources only: solar panels, wind turbines, 
electric batteries and converters. And version C allows for a mix of renewable and fossil fuel electricity sources, 
namely a hybrid micro-grid.

Abstract 
Human capital components are seen as critical knowledge resources for long-term success. As a result, knowledge 
sharing has become an essential component of organizational innovation. Individual and organizational learning, 
performance, job satisfaction, and creative behaviors are predicted in knowledge sharing. Personal objectives and 
needs, according to experts, have a significant impact on human behavior, such as creativity and innovativeness. Most 
need-based motivation theories assume very identical fundamental needs. Achievement, affiliation, and power 
describe the three basic psychological needs. This study aims to contribute to current research on McClelland's Needs 
Theory in knowledge management, especially team knowledge sharing. The research used Rasch Model analysis and 
Multiple Regression to examine McClelland's Theory of Needs in team knowledge sharing among knowledge workers 
in a service-oriented business. These Rasch results prove that team knowledge sharing varies greatly depending on 
the needs for achievement, affiliation, and power. While the regression analysis results also reveal that the need for 
achievement is greater than the effect of the need for affiliation on knowledge sharing. On the other hand, the need 
for power has a detrimental influence on information sharing.

1. Introduction
Knowledge and learning have emerged as critical components in maintaining competitiveness in business which are 
becoming increasingly complex, global, and fast-paced (Ogulin et al. 2020). Moreover, the efficacy of people, teams, 
and/or units, mainly, is strongly dependent on how well knowledge is communicated between individuals and/or 
groups (Wang and Wang  2012).  
Knowledge is an intangible asset frequently developed within a company by creating and deploying human resources 
(human capital pool). Knowledge is significantly tied to employees' individual jobs, talents, cognitive capacities, and 
behaviors and practices that contribute to organizational performance (Abdul-Jalal et al. 2013; Wang and Wang 2012). 
Knowledge is also composed of experiences, information, values, and attitudes that provide a proper framework for 
evaluating new information and experiences. When employees share their tacit or explicit knowledge, new knowledge 
is created. Hence, it is referred to as knowledge sharing (Hussein et al. 2019b; Mohajan 2019; Si Xue 2017). Individual 
knowledge sharing is essential in organizations because it drives knowledge creation and competitiveness. Even 
though measuring the effectiveness of sharing activities is difficult, knowledge sharing can improve organizational 
performance (Ahn and Kim 2017; Castaneda and Cuellar 2020; Si Xue 2017).  
According to scholars, businesses produce new knowledge through employee interaction and combination. It suggests 
that the exchange and variety of ideas and knowledge contribute to creating new knowledge. It connects previously 
disconnected ideas and knowledge or recombines previously connected ideas and knowledge in novel ways (Ahn and 
Kim 2017; Mohajan 2019; Ogulin et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020). Human inputs include ideas, attitudes, leadership, 
management planning, creativity, and self-efficacy. According to scholars, they constitute the foundation of 
innovativeness, in addition to research and development. Human exchanges of competence, expertise, information,

6. Conclusion 
Knowledge and learning have emerged as critical components in retaining competitiveness in an increasingly 
complicated, global, fast-paced corporate environment. The effectiveness of individuals, teams, and/or units is heavily 
reliant on how successfully information is transferred between individuals and/or groups. 
 
Human capital components are seen as knowledge resources. In the knowledge-based model, it is critical for long-
term success in terms of innovation. As a result, knowledge sharing is an essential component of knowledge 
management. Individual and organizational learning, performance, job satisfaction, and innovative capabilities are all 
predicted by knowledge sharing. 
 
The Person Map Recapitulation reveals that the desire for connection is the most powerful motivation, with the greatest 
logit value. It implies that these knowledge workers are more likely to engage in team activities that foster 
interdependence and collaboration with others. They cherish friendship and prefer cooperation over competition. 
 
All hypotheses are statistically accepted. These findings suggest that team knowledge sharing differs significantly 
depending on the needs for achievement, affiliation, and power. 
 
The regression analysis findings also suggest that the need for achievement is more significant than the effect of the 
need for affiliation on knowledge sharing. Although intimate ties among team members might enhance team 
knowledge sharing, the capacity to solve problems creatively has a more significant influence on knowledge sharing. 
 
On the other hand, the need for power has a detrimental influence on knowledge sharing. It suggests that team members 
with a strong need for power will dominate their work teams. They impose their will since they wish to constantly 
issue commands to other team members and shut their discussion room. It can have a detrimental influence on team 
performance and team spirit. 
 
The study still has limitations. First, using the research instrument in other service businesses such as hospitality, 
education, or public service is preferable. Other organizational characteristics, such as leadership and organizational 
culture, should be included. Finally, more items should be included in the research instrument to address McClelland's 
need theory in the local cultural context.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the effect of firm growth, leverage, profitability, institutional ownership, board size, and 
inflation variables on dividend policy. The object of this research is family firms classified as manufacturing firms on 
the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2017-2020. Selected by purposive random sampling technique, the study used 
144 samples from 36 family firms that met the criteria. Panel data regression results showed that, partially, leverage 
has a negative and significant effect on dividend policy while profitability has a positive and significant effect. 
Furthermore, firm growth, inflation, institutional ownership, and board size have no significant effect on dividend 
policy. The implication is that if investors want to choose firms that pay out high dividends, they must choose firms 
with low leverage and high profitability. Firms must be able to try to have lower leverage and continue to generate 
high profits to be able to distribute dividends.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing is a business sector that runs its production using modern machinery and equipment, as well as human 
resources in developing commodity materials that have value for resale. The manufacturing industry consists of 
several sectors, namely the basic and chemical industrial sector, the various industrial sector, and the consumer goods 
industrial sector. According to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS – Badan Pusat Statistik) (2022), the distribution 
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the manufacturing industry for four consecutive years was 20.16% in 2017, 
then decreased to 19.86% in 2018. In 2019, the contribution of the manufacturing industry was 19.70%, then 
increased in 2020 to 19.87%. The manufacturing industry provides the largest contribution to GDP, which can 
accelerate the growth of the national economy to increase the value of investment and export activities. 
According to PwC (2014) in Kristanti et al. (2019), family firms occupied more than 95% of firms in Indonesia. This 
refers to the involvement of the family in management positions. Out of all the family firms, the manufacturing 
sector dominates by 50%. According to Alderson (2018), a firm is considered a family firm when a family member 
is a chief executive and there are at least two generations of family control with at least 5% of the voting shares held 
by the family or related interests. Additionally, Drake (2009) state that family firms are defined as share ownership 
by individuals or families with no less or more than 25% of the voting rights and the rest is owned by small 
shareholders. According to Daily and Dollinger (1992), the involvement of family members in the board or the 
highest leader is characterized by two or more family members with the same last name. The manufacturing sector 
has 156 firms in the 2017-2020 period, which includes family firms. Based on the definition of Daily and Dollinger 
(1992) and Drake (2009), family firms that are classified as manufacturing firms are 93 firms.

5.2.4 The Effect of Institutional Ownership on Dividend Policy 
The test results showed that institutional ownership has no significant and positive effect on dividend policy, so H4 
is rejected. This proves that the larger the institutional shareholders, the greater the dividends paid. The involvement 
of institutional investors can direct managers and family shareholders in making strategic firm decisions on the use 
of cash allocations from profits. This can happen because the high profits generated by the firms are reinvested in 
expansion, which is expected to increase share prices, thereby increasing the profits of majority and minority 
shareholders. This finding supports Nguyen and Li (2020) who found that institutional ownership has an insignificant 
effect on dividend policy. However, it is not in line with Bataineh (2021) and Khan (2021) who found that 
institutional ownership has a positive and significant effect on dividend policy. 
5.2.5 The Effect of Board Size on Dividend Policy 
The test results showed that board size has no significant and positive effect on dividend policy. This means that 
hypothesis H5 is rejected. The positive direction indicates that the larger the size of the firms’ board of commissioners, 
the higher the dividend payout. This reflects the effective oversight of the board of commissioners to encourage higher 
dividend payouts. This could be because the number of expertise and the diversity of specializations of the board of 
commissioners in family firms is greater so that monitoring and supervision in the capital market coordinate 
effectively. This finding is not in line with Kilincarslan (2021), Khan (2021), and Tahir et al. (2020) who found that 
board size has a positive effect on dividend policy. 
5.2.6 The Effect of Inflation on Dividend Policy 
The test results showed that inflation has no significant and negative effect on dividend policy. This means that 
hypothesis H6 is rejected. With higher inflation, the operating prices of firms continue to increase. Thus, firms are 
more concerned with their internal funds to finance operations, hence the effect on the smaller dividends to be 
distributed. This finding is in line with Alkhatib (2020) who found that inflation has no significant and negative effect 
on dividend policy. However, it is contrary to Brahmaiah et al. (2018) who found that inflation has a negative and 
significant effect on dividend policy. 
6. Conclusion
This study examines the effect of firm growth, leverage, profitability, institutional ownership, board size, and inflation 
on dividend policy in family firms classified as manufacturing firms in Indonesia in 2017-2020. Statistical test results 
showed that, simultaneously, firm growth, leverage, profitability, institutional ownership, board size, and inflation 
have an effect on dividend policy. Partially, leverage has a significant and negative effect on dividend policy and 
profitability has a significant and positive effect on dividend policy. Furthermore, firm growth and inflation have no 
significant and negative effect on dividend policy. Meanwhile, institutional ownership and board size have no positive 
effect on dividend policy. 
The results of this study are expected to be beneficial for firms and investors. Firms that distribute low dividends need 
to pay attention to the interests of capital owners with the right level of leverage ratio for the use of profits for debt 
payments and dividend distribution. In this case, firms can do internal anticipation by identifying the financial 
conditions that must be maintained so that they can make wise decisions for the future. In addition, investors or 
potential investors in family firms can look through indicators of leverage ratios and profitability to assess high or low 
dividends. The results of this study indicate that family firms classified as manufacturing firms that pay high dividends 
have an indication of low leverage and high profitability. 
The determinants analyzed in this study are limited to the six variables of firm growth, leverage, profitability, 
institutional ownership, board size, and inflation. Many other factors can affect dividend policy. Therefore, it is 
suggested for further researchers to study more independent variables to provide additional findings and further 
discussions on the tendency of dividend policy expropriation in family firms.

Abstract 
Due to the rising growth of international collaboration, organizations have a higher need to employ expatriates. Both 
scholars and practitioners have acknowledged that skill development plays a crucial role in here to mitigate failures 
in the competitive international business environment. Within this paradigm, studies have highlighted that skill 
development is somewhat connected to how satisfied an expatriate feels in their job. Interestingly, there seems to be 
an interplay between the international experiences of males and females taking gender differences into consideration. 
Within this context, we aim to examine how job satisfaction is linked to skill development among expatriates working 
in Taiwan and do a gender-wise comparison. Data was collected from 133 expatriates working in Taiwan using an 
online questionnaire. Results show that both men and women expatriates on average are rated quite differently in 
terms of both job satisfaction and skill development. The results for moderation analysis show that even if female 
expatriates felt very satisfied with their opportunities for acquiring new skills, they were not to able take full advantage 
of the opportunities around for developing new skills and knowledge. This study calls for more action to be taken 
from the Human Resources department at both the expatriate’s home as well as the host country to create better 
opportunities for women to participate in more international assignments.

1. Introduction
A tremendous increase in global integration during the past few decades has accelerated population movement around 
the world (Strauss 2020). This trend has made travel experiences, international assignments, and international 
collaboration between individuals and organizations increasingly common (Shaffer et al. 2016). Due to the rising 
growth of international work assignments, organizations have a higher need to employ expatriates, however, Harari 
et al. (2018) add that not enough research exists that examines the factors around job satisfaction in expatriates. 
Moreover, the existing managerial approaches that exist to support expatriates’ preservation, preparation, growth, and 
job satisfaction are insufficient, which leads to their job dissatisfaction (Kumarika Perera et al. 2017; Hoffman and 
Sergio 2020). Expatriates are key to an organization as they can enhance management and coordination, as well as do 
knowledge transfer to their colleagues back in their home country (Bebenroth and Froese 2019; Harzing et al. 2016) 
upon finishing the international assignments. Therefore, examining the genuineness of expatriates ’job satisfaction 
will facilitate organizations to appropriately absorb, circulate, and do knowledge transfer related to job satisfaction 
between different business functions. A successful management of the expatriation process will enable an organization 
to fully leverage an expatriate’s knowledge and skills. Both scholars and practitioners acknowledge the crucial role of 
skill development in expatriates in mitigating failures in competitive international business and social environments 
(Li 2020; McNulty and Brewster 2016; Verbeke et al. 2018). Also, studies show that there seems to be some sort of 
interplay between the international experiences of males and females taking gender differences into consideration 
(Dolce et al. 2021; Shaffer et al. 2012; Connerley et al. 2008). Within this context, we aim to examine how job 
satisfaction is linked to skill development among expatriates working in Taiwan. After examining this particular

in Taiwan is perceived by expatriates to be more or less equally friendly to both males and females. For instance, this 
study showed that equal number of males and females felt positive about their colleagues’s method of working in 
general. Interestingly, more number females felt positive about the work climate and the way in which people 
communicate in offices compared to males. Surprisingly, it was found that more number of female expatriates were 
doing a part time as compared to full time jobs. One of the reasons for the smaller number of women expatriates doing 
full time jobs may have to do with the perceptions that some cultures are not very supporting to women in work 
environments. So, there might be corporate resistance to a certain degree at the home country in selecting female 
employees for full time jobs in overseas assignments, limiting the diversity of expatriate workers. Also, a greater 
number of females who had worked in Taiwan between 1-3 years had said that they will recommend Taiwan to their 
home country people. Considering the overall perceptions that women showcased about their work environment and 
work experiences, employing female expatriates in Taiwan for full time jobs for longer periods does not seem to be a 
problem.  
Secondly, the results for moderation analysis show that even if female expatriates feel very satisfied with their 
opportunities for acquiring new skills, they are not able to take full advantage of the opportunities around for 
developing new skills and knowledge. This calls for more action to be taken from the Human Resources department 
at both the expatriate’s home as well as host country to create more opportunities for women to participate in more 
international assignments. The organizations at both sides also need to make sure that they provide intercultural 
training and create a more conducive work culture so that more women come forward and leverage from expatriate 
experiences.  We contend that employment of more females in the international space by MNCs will enhance the 
quality of diversity in the workforce in the near future; associating this diversity with no decrements to overseas job 
performance. Employing women expatriates in international assignments can be considered like a win-win strategy 
for the organizations enhancing the gender diversity of expatriate groups with no declines in expatriate job 
performance and their skill development. Lastly, considering that the data was collected in Taiwan, the findings from 
this research, at the present, are limited by the sample studied. There exists a certain degree of variation in cultures of 
the world, especially in terms of the attitudes towards women. Therefore, we cannot generalize the findings to other 
cultures as all expatriates sampled were working in Taiwan and bound by idiosyncrasies particular to this country. 
Future researchers would benefit from doing such investigations in other countries that vastly differ along the spectrum 
of “acceptance of women in positions of power”.

Abstract 
Large-scaled distribution of vaccines can be highly complex and dynamic. This paper aims to propose an integrated 
framework that addresses the limitations of former literature in optimizing vaccine allocation for controlling the covid-
19 outbreak in Qatar. First, we predicted the total positive cases in Doha for the upcoming 14 days using 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling. The best fit model was ARIMA (4,2,4) based on 
BIC (Bayesian Information Criteria) with an overall MAPE of 4.86% and 𝑅𝑅2 of 0.9973 values. Then, we formulated 
a mathematical model to optimally allocate covid-19 vaccines to the twenty-five Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCCs) 
considering the total associated disease spread risk among the population, operational capacity limitations, and the 
transfer of ATP (Available to Promise) quantities between the centers. The obtained results provided managerial 
insights on how decision-makers can create efficient logistical capabilities for covid-19 vaccine allocation.

1. Introduction
Two years since the covid-19 outbreak, it claimed more than 6 million lives worldwide, including 678 deaths in Qatar 
(MOPH  2022). According to a report issued by the Asian Development Bank, the estimated global economic loss 
could reach 5.8 trillion to 8.8 trillion USD  (Sawada & Sumulong  2021), pushing millions into poverty and 
contributing to the rising rates of domestic abuse and mental health issues. Despite these dark numbers, global efforts 
contributed to breakthroughs in developing safe covid-19 vaccines at a wrapping speed. However, ending the covid-
19 pandemic is not about the development of vaccines; it is about the administration of vaccines (Mak et al. 2021). 
The American center for disease control and prevention stated that although 14 million doses have already been 
produced in late 2020, only 2 million doses were administered. Adding to the urgency of distributing vaccines, the 
virus continues to spread rapidly and mutate. Thus, racing against the time, the current mass vaccination effort can be 
challenging in terms of: 
1.1. Vaccine Production 
The availability of the raw material, such as the enzymes used to convert DNA to mRNA for Pfizer and Moderna 
vaccines and packaging material, such as vials and stoppers, can limit the vaccine production rate. Also, the production 
yield can be unpredictable because of the uncertainty imposed in the production process. For example, AstraZeneca's 
vaccine requires cells' growth inside bioreactors, which is a very delicate process that causes significant delays in its 
delivery. As a result, more than 130 countries have not received a single covid-19 vaccine dose by February 2021 
(Beaubien  2021). Notably, any modifications to scaling up the vaccine production capacity require regulatory 
approvals, which take a long duration. 
1.2. Variability and Eligibility of the Demand 
Vaccine hesitancy can be one factor contributing to demand variability. As per (Brenan  2021), 29% of healthcare 
workers in the U.S. hesitated to take the vaccine. Accordingly, the demand variability can impact the amount of 
vaccine wastage given the sensitive process of administering the mRNA vaccine.

The first model is a time series prediction model that forecasts the cumulative number of confirmed covid-19 cases in 
Qatar for the upcoming two weeks. The best-obtained model is ARIMA (4,2,4) with a MAPE of 4.86% and 𝑅𝑅2 =
0.9973.  Using the model, the estimated total number of cases can reach up to 46,142. Then, the estimated values can 
be imported into the optimization model.  
 
The optimization model aims to minimize the infection transmission among the community throughout the planning 
horizon by allocating vaccines to healthcare centers based on the total risk of the individuals that a healthcare center 
is serving. The model was applied to 2.4 million residents of Qatar (about 40,080 daily individuals per period) by 
assigning the population to 25 healthcare centers according to the demographic data provided by the planning and 
statistics authority, the maximum time between medical centers was estimated using the geospatial data from google 
mapping services, and the risk for each priority group was calculated using the total deaths from covid-19 per age 
group. Then, the model was verified and validated as it successfully incorporated the susceptibility rating and exposure 
risk in the allocation decisions. Finally, sensitivity analysis for different parameters namely pack size, available stock, 
and operational capacities was conducted to have a better insight into the model’s reliability.

Abstract 
The pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus has had negative effects on different industrial sectors, the world 
economy and especially on Supply Chains. The pandemic revealed the vulnerability of key logistics processes of 
companies and their Supply Chains as operational risks increased, causing breaks in inventories, production lines and 
the distribution process caused by increased customer demand. However, this pandemic makes it necessary to re-
evaluate the models and strategies that companies had established as the standard, and more was needed to face the 
shortage of components, raw materials and inputs needed to keep the production processes active. Therefore, this 
article proposes developing a conceptual model under the System Dynamics methodology, which allows identifying 
the main impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the performance of the Supply Chain through the design of 
Causal Loop Diagrams.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, the first cases of atypical viral pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, China. Preliminary findings 
showed that all these cases had symptoms like H1N1 flu; however, studies determined that it was a new virus named 
SARS-CoV-2, and later, it was named COVID-19. Due to frequent air travel between China, Europe, the United States 
and other countries, the new virus spread in the following weeks among the world's population, and the World Health 
Organization declared it a pandemic, posing a devastating threat to human health (Al-Rohaimi & Otaibi  2020).  
According to Pongutta et al. (2021), in addition to the negative effects it generated on the health of the population, 
COVID-19 also caused adverse effects on other aspects of life due to the measures implemented by governments to 
control the disease; for example, social distancing, the use of rubber bullets, closure of ports and port logistics 
activities, generating the delay of goods and disruptions in different global Supply Chain, stoppages in production

Figure 7. Scenario 2, 80% of the employees are vaccinated. 
5. Conclusion
Causal Loop Diagrams are a System Dynamics tool that allows for identifying the causal relationships between the 
key variables of a system. In this article, it was possible to identify the impacts generated by COVID-19 on the key 
logistic processes of a Supply Chain, which are: procurement, production and distribution. 58 feedback loops were 
identified, of which 24 are reinforcing, and 34 are balancing. 
With the proposed causal diagram, a simulation model was developed using STELLA ARCHITECT ® software. The 
simulation model allowed us to analyze and evaluate some causal relationships, such as the impact that COVID-19 
has on the employees' contagion and how their absence can affect the production process. Likewise, two scenarios 
were proposed; the first one evaluated what would happen in the production process if 50% of the employees had been 
vaccinated, with the result that this would have a positive impact on the production process since there would be less 
contagion and production would remain stable. The second scenario evaluated what would happen if 80% of the 
employees had been vaccinated; the simulator showed that although there would be contagions in at least 5 employees, 
these would not affect the company's operations, and the ethanol production process would remain continuous.

In future work, it is proposed to evaluate other loops of the proposed causal diagram, such as COVID-19 on the 
company's distribution process, the selection of other suppliers in case there is a shortage of raw materials, and to 
consider financial indicators.

Abstract 
The interplaying of advanced technologies of the Industry 4.0 (I4) mandate towards the mines of the future creates a 
smart connected mining industry that transforms vast amounts of data into predictive and fully integrated intelligent 
systems. Thus, additional safety, stability, and predictability can be achieved to maximize efficiency while minimizing 
operating and capital costs. In addition, the road to overcoming mining challenges is fundamentally human-centered 
and has inclusive socio-economic development or what is known as sustainable development (SD) at its core. 
Throughout the production value chain, the mining sector faces various economic, geopolitical, social, and 
technological hurdles. Innovative manufacturing methods are required to introduce the next digital generation into the 
raw material area all the way to the tailings area. In the realm of increasing process automation, I4 applications are 
currently trending in the mining industry. This paper explores and debates process systems and automation outlook 
focusing on future automation systems in the context of minerals engineering, where mines can be categorized into 
human-governed, semi-self-governed, self-governed, and virtual mines. The paper discusses mining field challenges 
and opportunities and concludes with a discussion and future research paths in process system engineering prompted 
by I4 innovative system architecture.

1. Introduction
The increased demand for metals (particularly copper), harsh landscapes of mines, and environmental volatility 
coupled with an unstable workforce and a lack of insight into the benefits of a digitized plant are barring the mining 
industry from what lies beyond the fourth Industrial Revolution (I4). Overcoming these challenges is vital in future-
proofing mining plants and propping up existing legacy systems. The productivity in the mining sector has been 
questioned by industry giants looking for solutions to achieve not only upward scalability but also efficiency and 
insights to look for future sustainability relevance or known as sustainable development (Rodrigues and Mendes 
2018). Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology is a key to unlocking game-changing advantages in the mining 
industry. Creating a safer environment for the mining workforce is also another key to unlocking the next level of 
efficiency and productivity. Compared to legacy systems, predictive maintenance facilitated by the internet of things 
(IoT) provides a comprehensive overview of mining plants and machinery working conditions even in the most rugged 
landscapes. Human operators are at the heart of implementing an interoperable digital solutions, protecting each 
worker from potential incidents through real-time monitoring and comprehensive reporting of every single corner of 
the mining ecosystem (Horberry et al. 2018). Investment in technology and innovation sounds expensive and is 
considered a barrier but smart mining solutions will eventually overlay any legacy system. The promising 
synchronization of digital transformation shall deploy agile solutions that monitor energy and CO2 emissions, workers' 
safety, possible anomalies, and mining wastage in real-time. In other words, employing productive analysis that drives 
evidence-based strategy and implementation is feasible and mining plants as such would have the potential to become 
an industry example and a pivotal driver of economic growth and stability (Mateus et al. 2019). 
Automation and mechatronics or robotics are common parlance terms describing methods of separating people from 
technological machines. Robotics refers to the design, development, and deployment of autonomous vehicles, whereas

The summation and averages of performances for each KPI (efficiency level, amount of big data to process, and the 
inherent risks involved) for the main mine-to-mill processes are calculated and then pooled. Results show that the 
virtual mine performance pool value is the highest at 1.8, which is at the hypothetical maximum performance pooled 
value. Human-governed mines score 0.3 and semi-self-governed mines 0.5, both around the hypothetical minimum 
performance pooled value. Self-governed mines yield 1.5 in the direction of the hypothetical high-performance pooled 
value. The hypothetical minimum, medium, and maximum performance pooled values are 0.3, 0.9, and 1.8, 
respectively.

The results in Table 1 show that the higher adoption of automation level toward virtual mines promotes the most 
efficient utilization of resources, the highest capability in handling and processing big data to make timely (real-time) 
informed decisions, and grants the lowest risks inherent in such working environment since mine-to-mill processes 
and subprocesses shall be re-executed allowing optimum performance to be reached. However, the effects on 
manpower would result in a total replacement. 
 
5. Discussion and Conclusion  
Employing integrated advanced technologies into the mining industry unveils competitive advantages. Such as, first, 
greater accuracy and fast decision-making at which mining operations involve extensive processing of real-time data 
to share instant directives to the control units. Integrating BDA and ML can help mining companies collect data and 
deliver insightful on-site decisions to streamline processes by reducing the chances of errors. Second, health and safety 
where better and faster decision-making is a key factor in improving the health and safety of mineworkers as AI help 
them by reducing their exposure to dangerous situations in mining. Therefore, shifting the industry from a people-
oriented to a process-oriented. Third, efficiency-boosting by deriving patterns from previously accumulated huge data 
sets can drive efficiency by increasing processes' consistency and quality and reducing the chances of human errors. 
Forth, reducing environment footprints by embedding AI and ML into the previously existing systems can help the 
mining industry to reduce energy demand by reducing the environmental footprints. 
 
Smart manufacturing is transforming industrial processes and communities into the so-called society 5.0, enabling the 
emergence of a new industry-society-environment nexus. Integrating sensing, calculating, and actuating innovative 
technologies enables data-driven setups and automated decision-making executions. In the meantime, humans operate 
mining operations substantially with the assistance of software to make decisions. However, in this field, the 
expanding use of autonomous robots is critical for dealing with risks and extreme conditions as no or little labour is 
required. Therefore, creative production systems require information and communication technology, advanced 
modelling and solving algorithms, and auxiliary mechatronics. Mining's changing progressive evolution and rising 
complexity can be divided into four main categories: economic effects with macroeconomic variables, technological 
obstacles, geopolitical impacts, and socio-ecological influences. The direction to overcoming mining difficulties is 
primarily human-centered, with comprehensive socioeconomic development, often known as sustainable 
development. Digital transformation, as an enabler solution for the next generation of mines, strives to provide a 
supportive environment for industry-wide transformation, bringing us closer to the mine of the future. Starting with 
existing mines nomenclature, the roadmap can be illustrated in four phases, including human-governed, semi-self-
governed, self-governed, and virtual mines.

Abstract 
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been reluctant to gain attraction in the procurement segment of a company, 
many organizations have started to see its potential in the supply chain activities since it enables numerous sectors in 
the evolution of their business models. AI refers to intelligent algorithms or apparatuses that are capable of 
autonomously and systematically performing activities or cognitions without human intervention or mental decisions. 
In procurement and supply chain applications, AI can enhance design and operational frameworks, data visibility and 
analytics, opportunity assessment, accurate report generation and contract management, etc. This paper presents 
opportunities and applications of AI in procurement with particular emphasis on the procurement process carried out 
by Qatar Foundation (QF). QF is a non-profit organization which has a unique system as it involves over 50 entities 
with different activities related to education, research, and community development. This one-of-a-kind ecosystem 
comprises a unique and complex supply chain model. As a result, procuring different materials and services to cope 
with all entities’ requirement is a challenge due to the tremendous amount of data and purchases. The use of AI 
methodologies is anticipated to provide multiple benefits towards achieving improvements over diverse areas.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 (I4) technologies towards the digital transformation of the procurement process are evolving
to enhance it as I4 enables the connection of the physical and digital environments, resulting in better
decision making and increased resilience and efficiency. Based on Deloitte (n.d.), digital technologies are
categorized to the degree in which they are deployed in procurement into three categories: core, maturing,
and emerging. The core category represents solutions already implemented in larger systems with longer
implementation, including spending analytics, eSourcing, electronic catalogs, contract management,
supplier information management, eProcurement, eInvoicing, and eAuctions. The maturing category covers
solutions that transform procurement with minimal investment: cognitive computing/artificial intelligence,
intelligent content extraction, predictive/advanced analytics, visualization, collaboration networks,
crowdsourcing, 3D printing, and robotics. Finally, the emerging technologies are the solutions that could
impact procurement in the future, including blockchain, sensors, cyber tracking, and virtual reality.
According to Oxford Dictionary (2005), AI is defined as the theory and development of computer systems 
capable of performing activities ordinarily requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech 
recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI is the driving force of the fourth industrial 
revolution in the same way as mechanization, mass production, and automated production were previously 
(Sammalkorpi and Teppala  2019). The development of Industry 4.0 revolution is illustrated in Figure 1.

6. Conclusion 
Industry 4.0 technologies and the digitalization of the procurement process are evolving in this field, 
resulting efficient decision making and increased efficiency. AI is efficient at solving complex problems 
containing a vast amount of data. Such a technology has the potential to manage all the data from multiple 
sources, including supplier management software, online catalogs, and contracts. AI can automatically 
consolidate data, process data, and utilize it across business operations with its set of algorithms. Applying 
this know-how enables clients to constantly monitor and use complex information at any phase of the 
procurement cycle, from supplier identification to adopting deals, monitoring invoices, and organizing 
orders. Besides value extraction, analysis visibility, and quick and accurate automated data integration, AI

also helps customers manage procurement performance by fastening decision-making, disclosing savings 
and cost visibility, and using machine learning to generate reports. 
QF is a unique organization with different entities involved in education, research, and community 
development. This uniqueness in products and services created challenges in purchases categorization. 
Using AI by procurement department in QF will help to overcome the current challenges and will contribute 
in QF AI strategy. Therefore, adopting AI in procurement in QF is anticipated to provide numerous benefits 
for procurement and supply chain applications.

Abstract 
With the rise of Covid-19, employees in many countries have been advised to stay at home and perform their duties 
online rather than working on-site. This research aims to identify the working from home (WFH) concept, including 
its definition and related statistics, its positive and negative aspects, its relations with productivity, and future research 
directions. Hence, a systematic literature review has been conducted to cover the most recent literature related to the 
topic. Some interesting statistics were extracted from literature and presented in this paper showing the feasibility and 
the importance of this concept. Moreover, it covered the WFH pros and cons and summarized them in a table. In 
addition, many suggestions were provided to improve these aspects. Performance and productivity have also been 
highlighted since they are vital for the success of any organization. Furthermore, a list of future research directions 
was summarized in the paper, which may guide authors for future research by focusing on the mentioned knowledge 
gaps to take this research further.

1. Introduction
Although the phenomenon of remote work was established decades ago, it seems that this topic is only really gaining 
importance nowadays. With the appearance of the Covid-19 pandemic, people in many countries were advised to stay 
at home and reduce social contact. Consequently, many countries now encourage their employees to work from home, 
especially with the help of advanced communications and technology, which have brought changes to every aspect of 
work and social life. The possibility of working remotely can reduce the risk of exposure to the disease and the 
economic shocks associated with government actions to combat the Covid-19 pandemic (Alipour et al. 2020). One of 
the initial remote work definitions given by Olson (1983) is that it refers to ‘’organizational work that is performed 
outside the normal organizational confines of space and time’’ (Olson  1983, p. 182). One of the significant benefits 
of remote work is that it can allow the employees to work at their preferred times instead of having fixed office hours. 
The research aims to identify the Working from Home (WFH) concept, its pros and cons, its relations with 
productivity, and future research direction.  To do so, in this research, a systematic literature review will be conducted 
using five stages process used by Cooper and Hedges (1994). Such a process uses a formal procedure to formulate the 
problem, collect data, evaluate and analyze the collected data, and present the results in a suitable manner. The paper 
covered 20 years of research efforts related to the work from home topic, but its focus is on highlighting the most 
recent efforts, where the year 2020 formed 46% of total selected publications. The literature review covered in this 
paper shows that WFH is one of the hot topics which highlights the current situation of the world direction toward the 
WFH concept and lists the future directions and previous research gaps, for other researchers to continue in this field. 
The current paper can be a base for many other future studies in this era. Furthermore, some suggestions are covered 
in public presentation and discussion sections to improve the application of the WFH concept, which organizations 
might use to gain success in this area. 
The paper structure consists of six main sections. After the introduction, the research goal, objectives, and questions 
were discussed in the second section. The research methodology was presented in the third section. A systematic 
literature review approach was used to analyze the literature in the fourth section. The results and discussion were 
presented in the fifth section. At the end of the paper, the conclusions were summarized in the sixth section.

To answer the third research question, literature related to productivity was reviewed and analyzed to show that 
different results were revealed from these researches. Some of them stated that they have a positive relationship, while 
others said the opposite. This is mainly due to the different population of the study and the industry that the study 
covers. Future research directions extracted from reviewed literature were mentioned in previous sections, showing 
some of the gaps in the literature, where they can be addressed in future studies to extract the best from applying the 
WFH concept in organizations.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Due to the appearance of the Covid-19 pandemic, this study was done to cover a significant current concern, which is 
WFH for employees. This paper was prepared to highlight previous work related to the WFH concept, its pros and 
cons, its relation to productivity, and future research area, using a systematic literature review following five stages 
process. It was noticed that most of the related articles were published in 2020 with a high number of citations. This 
study will be able to highlight to the researchers the importance of this topic, and it is planned to move forward with 
this research to cover the knowledge gap observed in literature by studying more factors affecting the successful 
implementation of WFH, which may help the relevant enterprises to know the possibility of applying WFH in their 
organizations, which may help in setting their strategic plans for the future of the organizations.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many people to lose their jobs. Most laid-off people went into the informal 
sector, such as starting a small business. This research aims to examine the entrepreneurial orientation of the newbie 
entrepreneurs based on McClelland's classic theory of social motives and entrepreneurship. Only a few studies have 
been done on this subject, with Rasch Model Analysis to explain the research phenomenon. Multiple regression was 
used to validate the research hypotheses. The findings show that the need for achievement and the need for affiliation 
has a statistically significant direct impact on entrepreneurial orientation. On the other hand, a need for power directly 
impacts entrepreneurial orientation and has statistically declined. At the same time, the need for achievement, the need 
for affiliation, and the need for power directly impact entrepreneurial orientation simultaneously.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemic has affected almost all formal sectors, including the industrial sector, including industries 
such as travel, hospitality, sports, events, and entertainment; the export-import sector; the financial sector; the money 
market health sector; and even the education sector. In addition, the effects include macroeconomic effects in the form 
of shocks to production factors such as labor supply, production costs, and consumer demand (Middia Martanti et al. 
2021). 
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a loss of workers. As a result, 35.56 percent of businesses chose to reduce 
their workforce. Businesses make numerous efforts to retain employees. However, reducing working hours is a step 
that businesses take more frequently (32.66 percent) than other options, which results in income reduction. These 
layoffs were necessitated because eight out of ten businesses experience a decline in revenue (Rizaty 2021).

According to this study's findings, many new entrepreneurs are motivated by necessity (survival mindset). It 
demonstrates the critical nature of entrepreneurial training that focuses more on entrepreneurial attitude than on 
technical for Indonesian newcomers. Additionally, emerging entrepreneurs should be encouraged to engage in greater 
community-based networking. Social media may be utilized to augment network resources. Through the lens of 
McClelland's social motives, the data presented here offer new light on additional features of successful beginner 
entrepreneurs. This suggests that while judging novice entrepreneurs, the need for power, affiliation, and achievement 
might be considered. Furthermore, it will assist the Indonesian government and educational institutions by fostering 
the growth of newbie entrepreneurs. 
 
There are still certain limits to the research. First, it would be preferable to expand the EO dimensions to five. It's also 
crucial to examine the impact of EO on the performance of newbie MSMEs. Finally, another study is needed to 
determine how the usefulness of achievement training, social skill training, and leadership training. Hopefully, it will 
be blended into the capabilities of newbie entrepreneurs in operating their businesses. In addition, the study's limitation 
is the small sample size of new entrepreneurs. Additionally, data were collected exclusively in the Greater Jakarta 
area. Despite the small sample size, this study provides valuable insight into the entrepreneurial behavior of new 
entrepreneurs. Furthermore, we can comprehend the connection between McClelland's social motivations and 
entrepreneurial orientation. Future research on this subject is therefore recommended. Additional research should be 
conducted to determine the social factors influencing newbie entrepreneurs' business performance. Future research 
may be possible to examine the relationship more thoroughly by including all Indonesian entrepreneurs (not just 
newcomers). Additionally, there are unanswered questions regarding enhancing entrepreneurs' social motivations.

Abstract 
This research is based on the Supply Chain and covers Operations Management Perspective. Discussed below are how 
choices made at the Primary level of organizations affect operations and production. This study further goes on to 
describe how Transport Management as one of the key factors in operations, aid in getting a continuous flow in 
operational processes and in turn an increase in production levels. Factors such as communication, EDI 
implementations, warehousing and order fulfillment are extensively discussed as constituents of Transport 
Management. The relevance and consequences of the aforementioned factors are discussed to show the reader why 
and how they relate to Transport Management and ultimately to operations and production. 
This paper has discussed supply chain processes necessary for success, namely: order fulfillment, warehousing, 
transportation, and EDI Implementations. Our findings blended a list of causes, effects, and solutions to provide insight 
to organizations as to how production processes can be handled and how a unified system can be achieved. As 
aforementioned in today's rapidly increasing competitive markets, customers' expectations and demands, as well as 
an understanding of the organization’s current performance, can provide companies with an upper hand in their 
respective markets. The problem is not doing the wrong things, it is doing the right things the wrong way.

1. Introduction
Generally, Organizations are complex as they operate in such a way that processes and activities are numerous some 
of which are simultaneous. Internal factors are critical and deserve careful attention as they are the core operators of 
any organization, additionally external factors contain more complex issues as companies are required to adapt to 
constant changes in the economy, society and environment. Operations and Production are the drivers of success in 
organizations; however, these are not easily managed, due to our ever-changing world which requires flexible and 
imperative management techniques. 
The Transport sector plays a huge role in getting goods to and from various destinations, the Knowledge-based 
management of Transport will combat operational and production challenges. Transportation can be defined as the 
movement of goods from one location to another, and this movement refers to the flow of raw materials in the supply

4.2.1 Trucks 
One of the most convenient ways of moving goods is through trucks, as these vehicles can reach most places that are 
road led. Trucks are fast compared to other modes of transport, namely: trains, ships, and pipelines. While this mode 
is a little more than affordable, its flexibility, reliability and its easy accessibility allows it to be a resourceful mode. 
Keeping trucks or any firm vehicle well-maintained and in good shape is one way of ensuring delivery accuracy on a 
timely level. That way nothing that could be avoided, could cause delays resulting in stock-outs or late delivery. 
 
 
4.2.2 Water 
Ships lead the way in terms of transporting bulky goods such as coal, ore, petroleum and simple household goods like 
TVs and Toys. This is a cost-effective way of transporting goods, but the challenge lies in the amount of time it takes 
to reach its various destinations and many markets are not accessible via water. Organizations who utilize this mode 
of transport could improve delivery through service offerings such as a step-by-step notification system where 
customers are informed on how far the product is in its supply process. In this way customers can engage with the 
firm and the firm could offer an enjoyable experience. 
 
4.2.3 Air 
This is the fastest way of getting products to the customer and is often used to transport perishables. However, it is 
very costly and weight weary, meaning that it can only transport a small amount of goods at a time, but it still takes 
the number one spot as the fastest growing mode of transport. 
 
4.2.4 Railroads 
Many of the railroads carry the same products as cargo ships only over land. In terms of speed, it lies between water 
and trucks and is very affordable. Therefore, supply managers could have a look at the demand volume to use this 
mode to carry in bulk and to spend less. 
 
4.2.5 Pipelines 
These are often used to transport gases and liquids. This is the cheapest way of transporting goods, although the speed 
of delivery depends on the structure of the pipeline. This mode of transportation works in a dual system as the product 
needs to be transferred to trucks as soon as they arrive.  
 
In conclusion, keeping your business processes running smoothly is critical to the health of your organization. Think 
about the things your company needs to succeed and then implement a strategy that works for you. 
 
5. Recommendations 
Upon analysing the importance of outbound logistics strategies that encompass transportation, operations and 
production, it is vital when delivering materials that shortfalls are recognised -and diagnosed. To improve the delivery 
accuracy on the supply of materials to companies, every activity directly contributing to the movement of materials 
needs to be managed. Distribution management is a dynamic tool that if executed properly-can greatly influence the 
supply of materials. 
 
Distribution management can include inventory, transportation, and warehousing management (Kalakota & Ricker 
1999). Accuracy can make efficiency through planning, scheduling, and monitoring. Planning demands a combination 
of cycles of organising and collecting information and data about supply chains and strategies for product distribution 
(Astafieva et al. 2019). Assessing internal systems with a consumer’s perspective in mind is what creates a distinct 
variation in delivery offerings. Suppliers need to carefully investigate what methods send the materials send and 
deliver goods on time and at the right place-this encompasses planning your distribution channels. 
 
Price, quality, speed, safety, users’ budgets, and regular practices influence the decision of transport mode (Islam 
2013). When it comes to delivering goods and improving this process, it is essential that suppliers consider all factors 
when selecting a transport mode or route. The transport mode chosen must be appropriate for not only the 
material/product type, but also the delivery specifications and customer’s expectations and standard. 
Scheduling looks at resource management and alignment (Simeunovic  2017). Optimising all the supplier’s resources 
to reach the customer and fulfil the order by sending the right product, at the right time and at the right place for right 
the price. Certain resources could include the improvement of information technology systems and software. Not only

does technology aid the consumer in making an order and keeping contact with the supplier but it ensures goods can 
be tracked on how far they are in the movement process. This is where monitoring comes in. Information technology 
is a tool that can monitor customer satisfaction & build a continuous quality system (Tigu 2017) 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper has discussed supply chain processes necessary for success, namely: order fulfilment, warehousing, 
transportation and EDI Implementations. Our findings blended a list of causes, effects, and solutions to provide insight 
to organizations as to how production processes can be handled and how a unified system can be achieved. As 
aforementioned in today's rapidly increasing competitive markets, customers' expectations and demands as well as an 
understanding of the organizations current performance can provide companies with an upper hand in in their 
respective markets. The problem is not doing the wrong things, it is doing the right things the wrong way.

Abstract 
The proceeding paper seeks to define and discuss product and process design. In this research study, product and 
process design will be discussed in regard to feminine hygiene products, namely sanitary pads. This research study 
will discuss the ways in which the product and process design of sanitary pads can be improved in an effort to become 
more environmentally friendly, especially in terms of their disposal. The company that will be referred to regarding 
the sanitary pads will be non-Organic single-use sanitary pads. This paper will also utilize A+ Organic Pads as a form 
of comparison, as a way to showcase the fact that is possible for companies to manufacture purely organic or 
environmentally conscious products. A research methodology will also be presented in order to present the methods 
used to gather the information within this paper. The results and discussion will follow, which will report on the 
information found, and the discussion will explain and interpret the results, as well as place the information found in 
context. Recommendations will also be provided as to how companies like non-Organic pads, can improve their 
product and process design to be more eco-friendly especially in the disposal stage of their sanitary pad products. 
Finally, the paper will be concluded, and a references page can be found at the end.

1. Introduction
In any company the product and process design is extremely important, especially when it comes to ensuring that the 
company is producing products of sound quality. Product and process design forms part of the life cycle of a product 
or products, and it is during this phase that decisions such as what the product will be made of as well as how the 
product will be made are visited (Heizer et al. 2017).  
During the product and process design, the overall eco-friendliness of the product or products that are to be produced 
must be considered. The environmental sustainability of a product when it is disposed of is just as important as when 
it is being produced and used. It is in the best interests of companies to ensure that their products do not impact the 
environment negatively when they are disposed of. This body of work seeks to discuss the environmental effects of 
plastic packaging of feminine hygiene products, while also providing possible alternatives to plastic packaging. It is 
important for corporate social responsibility to be incorporated into the processes of companies, such as the 
companies’ impact on the environment.

would in turn result in the pads being less of a threat to the environment as these are products that are able to be 
consumed by microbes. 
 
6. Conclusion  
It is important for companies to make provisions to include and adhere to Corporate Social Responsibility, this is 
especially the case for global companies as they are leaders in their respective industries and sectors. The product and 
process design of products is a major aspect to consider when companies are looking for ways to make their products 
more environmentally conscious. It is no secret that plastic is amongst the biggest pollutants in the world today, and 
companies such as, Non-Organic contribute to this pollution as their products consist of elements of plastic while also 
being packaged in plastic. To remedy this, it is important that innovative ways are created within companies that 
produce feminine hygiene products, so that they can find other ways to produce and package their products in a less 
environmentally harmful fashion. A company such as A+ Organic Pads, which also produces feminine hygiene 
products, does so in a completely environmentally friendly manner, while still being able to cater to the needs of their 
customers.

Abstract 
 
Restaurants that have a unique theme have a special impression for visitors. Restaurants that have a European style 
theme in Indonesia get special attention for visitors because they provide a unique experience. The innovation in this 
themed restaurant is not only visited for meals, but has shifted to become a place for tourism because it not only offers 
places to eat but also the atmosphere of the restaurant and its surroundings like in Europe. This study aims to examine 
the correlation of the variables of service quality, tourism product experience, tourist experience, and tourist loyalty. 
The methodology is by observing 200 tourists visiting a European-themed restaurant in Bandung, Indonesia. This 
study uses 18 question items. The data were examined using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results prove 
the correlation between service quality, tourism product experience, tourist experience, and tourist loyalty. This 
research contributes to researchers and tourism managers to find out more about what tourists are interested in 
destinations.

1. Introduction 
Managing the traveler experience has been identified as an integral part of improving tourism (Pratt et al. 2020). The 
essence of managing the tourist experience is associated with improving the relationship between the tour manager 
and the customer. The quality tourism services are determined by the strength of service interactions between 
managers and tourists (M. Zhang et al.  2017). The tourism industry has been at the forefront of improving customer 
experience (Sugathan & Ranjan  2019). 
 
Around the world, customer experience management has become a phenomenon that has been phenomenal in the 
tourism industry. In Thailand , the majority of all tourist interactions have been digital (Orel  2020). This is in an effort 
to provide a better experience for tourists. In China, the tourist experience has been enhanced by the adoption of 
modern technology. Trends in tourist experience management are consistent in China. Around 2010, tourism operators 
in China have improved their tourism services to exceed tourist expectation. This step aims to increase tourist (Bu et 
al.  2020). 
 
The tourism industry in Indonesia, unlike in other countries, is the inability of tourism managers to give more hope to 
tourists (Westoby et al.  2021). Long queues and congestion in tourism areas and the inability to offer more services 
in tourist areas make many tourists turn to other tourist destinations in neighboring countries such as Malaysia, 
Singapore, and Thailand (Hengky & Kikvidze  2018). The increasing competition in the tourism industry itself that 
causes tourists switch their visits to other tourist destinations (Hilmiana et al.  2020). The economic crisis experienced 
by Indonesia due to the pandemic has affected the behavior of tourists to exceed their expectations of tourist 
destinations (Esquivias et al.  2021). In 2020, it is the worst year in the history of world tourism. The COVID-19 
pandemic has had an impact on the tourism sector around the world. This pandemic reduced the flow of tourist arrivals

3. Conclusion 
The project management became one of the most important field. It went through such huge changes in the 
recent years, different new trends and strategies have been adopted and old trends have been outdated with the 
passage of time. PMI one of the oldest organizations in project management announced that PMBOK till 
nowadays was focusing on traditional project management techniques. However, due to Technology, product life 
cycles become shorter and the conventional project management approach, it becomes impossible to line up 
easily with unstable requirements of the project for this reason agile project management methods and 
approaches emerged and started to be adopted PMI especially in the 7th version of the PMBOK (Master of 
project academy 2019)  With this research work, we learned divers important aspects of project management 
approaches the two most famous flows Traditional and Agile, we assimilate the advantages, disadvantages and 
the dissimilarities between both of them; this comparison offers to managers a view to choose the appropriate 
methodology that can support the development of the project.   
For the upcoming work, it will be established on the project management methodologies used in the industrial 
field, also we will discuss the evolution and the limits of the main methodologies used since the first industrial 
revolution till the industry 4.0.

1. Introduction
One of the most important things in meeting people's needs and economic development is energy (Hashemizadeh et 
al.  2022). There are two forms of energy resources: primary and secondary energy (Kartiasih et al  2012). Primary 
energy is energy provided by nature without transformation processes, while its transformation through several 
processes is called secondary energy (Kartiasih et al  2012). The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the 
Republic of Indonesia in the Indonesia Energy Outlook (2019) stated that primary energy consists of oil, natural gas, 
coal, and renewable energy.

The authors focus on coal as a primary energy in Indonesia. Coal production in Indonesia during 2010 – 2013 increased 
but during 2014 – 2015 decreased by 3.43% from 2013 (Figure 1). Most of the production, around 78%, is used for 
export. The amount exported in 2015 decreased by 4.22%. This movement in export value is in line with coal energy 
consumption worldwide as shown in Figure 2. Not only in worldwide point of view, energy consumption from coal 
for domestic use also has decreased drastically since 2013 (Figure 3).

1. Introduction 
Coffee has been one of the top three beverages that people seek when they want to drink something hot or cold. Over 
the last 50 years, coffee has seen increase in consumer demand. The producers and consumers might seen the changing 
trend of coffee. Major transformation history of coffee culture divided into three different “waves”. These waves of 
coffee represent how accessible or appreciated coffee was at certain point in time.  
This first “wave” happened from the late 1800’s to 1920. It was defined by a global increase in mass-produced 
consumable foods. Second wave of coffee signifies a shift in the expectations of consumers. Which means, in the 1990s 
the consumers start to demand for higher quality and better tasting. In the early to late 2000s, consumers in third wave 
began to value the intricacies of coffee’s many origins and flavors, similar to how a wine connoisseur values their 
favorite fermented grapes. During third wave, a lot of local coffee shop was opened and starts to offer their coffee using 
local beans to the customers. 
As one of the world’s leading producers of coffee, Indonesia had previously exported most of the coffee beans that it 
produces. When the third wave hits Indonesia, the local beans gain popular and has been used by local coffee shop. The 
rise of specialty roasters and artisanal coffee shops at the emphasize local, single-sourced beans. This third wave led to 
total coffee consumption increased from 1990 to 2020. Startup companies, as an organization in the early phase, have 
different characteristics than mature organization (Nurchayo et al.  2018). The local coffee shop using sometimes using 
both or one of the two model businesses, Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C). 
All stakeholder in organization, from top management to front-line employees, must commit to the time and effort 
needed to obtain simple benefits during operations. (Nurcahyo et al.  2020). The top priority for the development of a 
delivery strategy is the functional capability of production/operations (Nurchayo et al.  2018). Since there are a lot of 
independent coffee shops in big cities, such as Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya, it is important for the coffee shop to set 
up a good strategy to gain competitive advantage. In the context of coffee shops, a traditional Cost Leadership strategy 
could involve choosing a lower price point for products, minimizing service time or using location to create greater 
convenience for customers (Cleland.  2019). Therefore, this study will take XYZ Coffee Shop in Jakarta, Indonesia as 
an example to explore the competitive strategy.

808","4. Conclusion 
Based on this study, we can conclude that SWOT analysis helps XYZ Coffee Shop to overcome challenges by 
identifying four elements in it. Marketing mix analysis is used as a strategy to formulate a product offering to 
customers. By using SWOT analysis and marketing mix analysis, we can determine the strategies that must be taken 
to achieve the goals, where the low-cost leadership strategy can be applied to XYZ Coffee Shop to achieve their main 
goal, which is to sell its product with affordable price.

1. Introduction
In the globalization era, competition pace among the industry has been becoming faster. This leads in changes on 
business process of many companies, including companies in Indonesia. Implementing international standards for 
management system becomes a critical step and decision for the companies in order to survive in the competition. 
(Nurcahyo and Alfredo 2018). Brent Crude oil is a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide. While 
Brent Crude oil is sourced from the North Sea the oil production coming from Europe, Africa and the Middle East 
flowing West tends to be priced relative to this oil. Brent is the leading global price benchmark for Atlantic basin 
crude oils. It is used to set the price of two-thirds of the world's internationally traded crude oil supplies. It is one of 
the two main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide, the other being West Texas Intermediate (WTI). 
Indonesia have a Standardization of fuel oil Price called Indonesia Crude Price (ICP). If looked Figures 2 and 3, ICP 
and Brent Crude Oil have same fluctuation. And the Figure 4, the comparison of fuel oil and gas price showed any 
gap that can be opportunity PT Antam, Tbk to get Operational Effectiveness.  
The authors focus on Brent e of Crude oil majority increased. This situation is important to PT Antam Tbk, related to 
the fuel oil Price that consumed to produce electricity. If the ICP or Brent Crude Oil increase, impact the cash cost 
production of the smelter will be increased). Main purpose of optimization in industry is to increase efficiency in 
production (Nurcahyo, et al. 2016).

5. Conclusion 
The Strategy of PT Antam Tbk to diversification Fuel oil to gas got big impact in the Operation of Smelter and 
environment. The Concern to achieve this strategy is obtaining competitive gas prices at plant gates with guaranteed 
supply from sustainable gas providers, so that savings is obtained when compared to the use of fuel oil. Changing in 
fuel to gas do not affect the performance of the electrical system, both in terms of capability and generator performance 
at Diesel Engine Power Plant (DEPP), so Diesel Engine Power Plan can still operate properly. Substitution of fuel 
from Fuel Oil to gas can reduce the company's annual GHG emissions and carbon tax by 25%. GHG emissions from 
the original 390 thousand tons CO2-eq decreased to 292 thousand tons CO2-eq with a decrease in GHG emissions per 
tons’ nickel in ferronickel by 3.79 CO2-eq (from 15.04 tons CO2-eq to 11.25 tons CO2-eq). Carbon tax from the 
original 1.95 million USD decreased to 1.46 million USD. The reduction in carbon tax per tons of nickel in ferronickel 
is 19 USD (from 75.2 USD to 56.2 USD).

Abstract 
Indonesia's retail industry for the fashion sector continues to grow rapidly due to an increase in per capita income and 
an increase in the upper-middle class. The fast globalization has forced the fashion industry to grow rapidly to cope 
with global trends. The need for clothing as the basic need of human life makes the fashion industry remain a 
sustainable industry despite globalization. Even though the fashion industry provides basic need such as clothing but 
fashion retailer needs a strategy to not just survive the fashion retail business but also lead the fashion retail market. 
The formulation of strategy is important for a company to withstand the market challenge and become the leader in 
the market. By using Porter’s generic strategies, fashion retail companies are assessed and compared their financial 
performance. In this research, we analyze the financial performance of the company PT. Ramayana Lestari Sentosa 
Tbk, PT Matahari Department Store Tbk, and PT Mitra Adiperkasa Tbk. The goal is to assess their financial 
performance based on Porter’s generic strategies. This financial analysis is an encouragement either for the 
entrepreneurs to start fashion businesses or small businesses to continue developing since in the future fashion business 
is always tempting for investors and customers.

Fashion Retail, Porter’s Generic Strategies, Financial Performance 
1. Introduction
One of the basic needs of human life is clothing. The need for clothing is very important for humans to protect 
themselves from the weather whether it’s hot or cold. Clothing as the basic need for human life has created a business 
opportunity for the clothing supply. The fashion industry is indeed a dynamic business, characterized by demand 
uncertainty resulting from the high variation in styles and consumer tastes, which makes it impossible to forecast 
demand accurately. Several factors such as an increase in purchasing power of Indonesian consumers, especially on 
special occasions like Aid Mubarak, Christmas, Chinese New Year, etc.; high population growth; rising income per 
capita; and a rise of middle-up class people in Indonesia support the Indonesian retail growth. 
The rapidly growing globalization has enforced the clothing supply industry to also involve in the fashion trend by 
designing within the trend or even becoming the trendsetter itself. In addition, fashion determines someone from social 
class to their characteristic. The current business model also makes fashion retailing more utilized, not many 
manufacturers directly sell their fashion products to the customer but most of them sell to a retailer and then the retailer 
is the one who will sell the manufacturer’s product to the customers. 
Indonesia with its large population makes it one of the biggest markets for a fashion retailer. Even though the market 
is large, the fashion retailer has many competitors other than the retailer itself but also small-medium enterprises that 
are also competing with them in the fashion market. The occurrence of a pace of innovation that exists in the new 
market and the changing pattern of consumers requires the existence of a strategy. A strategy is an incremental action 
-continuous improvement- continuously and is done based on the point of view of what to expect in the future
(Nurcahyo et al. 2018).
According to Rangkuti (2006), as cited in Nurcahyo et al. (2018), there are two related concepts in determining the 
developed strategy, which is distinctive competence, where a company has a competence that is not easy to be imitated

Cost leadership is divided into 2 categories, namely low cost, and best value. In this study, the fashion retail company 
that adopted the cost leadership strategy – low cost is PT. Ramayana Lestari Sentosa Tbk. They offer brands that are 
considered cheap, with the lowest product price among their rivals. Some of the brands that are sold at Ramayana are 
Emba Classic, S135, M231, Emba Jeans, Benhill, Twist, Pingu, Gabrielle, Larusso, Fladeo, RAF21. Ramayana is also 
targeting a large market, identified by the penetration of their store. As of 2020, Ramayana owns 106 department store 
outlets and 79 supermarket outlets in 54 cities around Indonesia. Based on ROA, ROE, and Net Profit Margin, 
Ramayana's financial performance is lower than Matahari but higher than Mitra Adiperkasa.  
 
Fashion retail company that adopter the cost leadership strategy – best value is PT. Matahari Putra Prima Tbk. They 
offer products that are still considered a low price, but not as low as Ramayana. Some of the brands that are sold at 
Matahari are Connexion, Nevada, T-Zone, details, Greenlight, Cardinal, and Cole. Their market is also large. At the 
end of 2020, Matahari have 147 outlets operating in 76 cities. When comparing the financial performance of Matahari 
to Ramayana and Mitra Adiperkasa, Matahari has the best ROA, ROE, and Net Profit. 
 
Second Porter’s generic strategy is Differentiation. Differentiation strategy should be pursued only after a careful 
study of buyers’ needs and preferences to determine the feasibility of incorporating one or more differentiating features 
into a unique product that features the desired attributes. A differentiation strategy is adopted by companies when 
there are many ways to differentiate the product, buyer needs and uses are diverse, few rival firms are following a 
similar differentiation approach, and technological change is fast-paced. This strategy requires companies to create 
unique products and differentiate their products from competitors (Banker, Mashruwala & Tripathy 2014). Firms can 
benefit from a differentiation strategy when product prices are higher than those required to create a unique product 
(Firoz et al. 2019). To achieve the highest degree of differentiation, a customer-specific customer offer is required. It 
can be assumed that the potential for customer individualization increases with the increasing number of different 
product variants  
 
In this study, the fashion retail company that adopted the differentiation strategy is PT. Mitra Adiperkasa Tbk. Mitra 
Adiperkasa offers many fashion brands that are considered higher class than what Ramayana and Matahari offer. The 
price of their brand’s product is in the mid-range. Some of the brands that are sold at MAP are ZARA, Typo, Innisfree, 
Sulwhasoo, Pull&Bear, Stradivarius, Bershka, Marks & Spencer, and Zara Home, Lacoste, Calvin Klein. They also 
target a large market, as of now, they have 2600 retail outlets in 81 cities in Indonesia. Mitra Adiperkasa has the lowest 
financial performance when compared to Ramayana and Matahari in terms of ROA, ROE, and Net Profit. 
 
Ramayana, Matahari, and Mitra Adiperkasa are targeting middle to low segment. Based on our research, in general, 
retailers who use a cost leadership approach to target the low-income market perform better than those who use a 
differentiation strategy to target the middle-income market. The retail industry, particularly fashion retail, is 
undergoing a bifurcation trend, according to Lobaugh et al. (2018), in which the market is divided and shifting between 
lower and upper classes. The market was won by either price-based retailers or premium retailers. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The purpose of this study is to compare the implementation of Porter's generic strategy and analyze the impact of its 
implementation on the company's financial performance. Three Porter's generic strategies analyzed are cost leadership, 
differentiation strategy, and focus strategy. Three fashion retail companies in Indonesia, namely PT. Ramayana Lestari 
Sentosa Tbk, PT Matahari Department Store Tbk, and PT Mitra Adiperkasa Tbk were chosen to be the objects of this 
research. 
 
The results of this study indicate that these three fashion retail companies have successfully implemented Porter's 
generic strategy. Based on qualitative analysis, namely fashion brands, product price range, and market, Ramayana 
adopted a cost leadership strategy - low cost, Matahari adopted a cost leadership - best value strategy, while Mitra 
Adiperkasa adopted a differentiation strategy. 
 
Based on the company's financial performance (ROA, ROE, and Net Profit Margin), the order of the company's 
financial performance from highest to lowest is Matahari, Ramayana, and Mitra Adiperkasa. Because of the retail 
bifurcation trend, it can be stated that retailers who implemented a cost leadership strategy, which targets the low-
income market, perform better than those who implemented a differentiation strategy, which targets the middle-
income market.

However, there are still many shortcomings that need to be corrected in this study, because this research is based on 
limited secondary data that data and information are collected from online sources and company annual reports. To 
get better analysis and more accurate data, it is necessary to collect primary data and more information directly from 
the company.

1. Introduction
Airport is anything related to air transport management and other activities in carrying out the functions of safety, 
security, smoothness, and orderliness of aircraft, passenger, cargo, and postal traffic flows (Agustiana and Budiastuti 
2020). According to The International Air Transport Association (IATA) press release, Indonesia’s aviation potential 
is huge and by 2034, it is expected to be the sixth largest market for air travel. As of 2018, airport management in 
Indonesia holds more than 60 operating airlines, serves 122 million passengers and 78 international destinations 
(IATA 2019). Airports in Indonesia are managed by two major companies, PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT 
Angkasa Pura II (Persero). PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) currently manages 15 airports throughout the east side of 
Indonesia, while PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) has managed 19 airports in the west side of Indonesia, including 
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Like most airports around the world, airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura 
II (Persero) provide both aeronautical and commercial services. Aeronautical services refer to operational and traffic 
processing services, including aircraft landings and take-offs, cargo processing, ground support services, and airport 
safety, security, and emergency services (Wang and Song 2020). Commercial services consist of franchise-based 
business and self-operations, including ground handling for airlines, catering services, duty free, retail shops, 
restaurants, the leasing of airport space inside and outside the terminals, the provision of goods warehousing, and 
car parking services (Wang and Song 2020). PT Angkasa Pura II Persero also provides pilgrim flight services which 
cooperate with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Religion (Angkasa Pura II 2020). 
The air transport industry highly contributes to the development of the economy and society of any country in the 
world, mainly because it generates jobs and stimulates social and economic activities (Nieto et al. 2021). Airports 
directly contribute to economies by providing services to airlines, moving passengers, and transporting cargo. The 
movement of goods and people also benefits governments, consumers, and industries (Twinn et al. 2021). According 
to the 2020 Annual Report of PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero), the operating revenue earned from 2016 to 2018 
increased significantly from 6,645 billion Rupiah to 11,193 billion Rupiah, and resulted in profit for the year around 
2,000 billion Rupiah. Meanwhile in 2019, there was a slight decrease in the revenue to 11,048 billion Rupiah, which 
impacted the profit earned to 1,007 billion Rupiah. According to the International Air Transportation Association, 
IATA, in 2018, the airline industry in Indonesia carries 122.2 million people, supporting 4.2 million jobs and 
contributing US$ 24 billion to the GDP of Indonesia. 
As a company that has a core business in the airport services, the revenue earned by PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) 
is strongly influenced by passenger and aircraft traffic at Angkasa Pura II airports. For instance, according to the 
836","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Rome, Italy, July 26-28, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
in activities of construction services, security services, parking management, carwash, building management, and 
hotels. These businesses are in different fields from the main business of PT. Angkasa Pura II (Persero) which mainly 
engaged in the transportation field. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Angkasa Pura II as one of the state-owned companies that moves in airport services turns out using more than 11 
types of strategy in their business operations. The company uses integration strategy to integrate their line of business 
with the objective of reducing obstacles in their business operations and also increasing company profit. By doing 
integration strategy in their business process Angkasa Pura II can get new lines of revenue stream from new business 
that they acquire, and reduce competitors in their line of business.The company also uses defensive strategy such as 
divestiture when Covid-19 pandemic hit Indonesia. By doing defensive strategy in their business operations show 
that Angkasa Pura II are flexible enough and have a good management that is ready to take risks when times are 
tough. As expected from the defending strategy the company can survive during Covid-19 pandemic hit airline 
industries. As we knew at that time there’s a lot of restrictions in place, which made travel harder, as a result made 
profit in travel industries drop drastically.

Abstract 
The sports footwear industry has a fierce competition within because of the consumers are price-sensitive. Footwear 
products is one of the most profitable sections in the sports industry company compared to the other section. 
Nowadays, as consumers have access to the information needed, they become more selective in selecting products. 
Companies have to develop a strategy to make their products stand out compared to their competitors. This paper 
chose Nike and Adidas as the object of study as they are two of the biggest companies in the sports footwear industry. 
The findings of this study showed that both Nike and Adidas implemented strategies constantly improve their financial 
performance and increased their revenue from footwear products.

1. Introduction
In sports, the equipment used by athletes often significantly affects their performance for example a racket that has 
better grip, or a suit that provides better aerodynamics. In addition, equipment is also an important factor in terms of 
injury, because incorrectly installed equipment can easily lead to accidents. In the fast-moving sports market, 
companies are constantly being challenged to come up with new products that outperform competitors' products and 
deliver good fit and performance. However, many products in the sports goods industry have reached maturity, and 
can hardly be upgraded by conventional methods (Meier et al. 2018). Then, the most important factor for consumers 
to buy sports shoes is the comfort, quality and brand of the sports shoes (Che et al. 2020). In addition, based on the 
results of the study, it was found that the relationship between consumer love for sports stars affects the sales of sports 
shoe brands, this is proven by a survey conducted on the Nike and adidas brands from 300 respondents, where both 
brands are worn by sports stars (Zhou et al. 2020). Brand strength also greatly affects sales of sports shoes, where the 
strength of the brand is a characteristic of consumer preference, quantity, uniqueness, and consumer familiarity with 
the brand (Mühlbacher et al. 2016). 
The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 is accelerating with unprecedented global restrictions on daily 
life. These global restrictions, in some countries experiencing ""lockdown"", and of course have an impact on economic 
aspects in all sectors. In the UK, the lockdown has resulted in the suspension of professional sporting events which 
have an impact on consumer behaviour (Wardle et al. 2021). The COVID-19 crisis has affected the sports industry, 
so a strategy that focuses on marketing activities, joint product development and internationalization is needed (Ratten 
et al. 2021). 
Business strategy is indispensable to a company which can become more active and sensitive to future threats. For 
external factor, environmental uncertainty needs to be considered for improving their strategy. (Kurnia and Nurcahyo

6. Conclusion
This study investigates the effectiveness of differentiation strategy in sports footwear industry. Nike and Adidas were 
selected as the object of this study since both of them were the two biggest companies in this industry. This study 
compared the differentiation strategies of Nike and Adidas implemented in their footwear product towards the market. 
The findings of this study showed that both Nike and Adidas implemented strategies constantly improve their financial 
performance and increased their revenue from footwear products. In the span of 5 years from 2017 to 2021, Nike 
revenues percentage changes were 6%, 9%, -4%, and 20% while Adidas revenues percentage changes were 3%, 6%, 
-18%, and 12% consecutively.
From this study we found that Nike has a better performance in terms of revenue percentage changes than Adidas. 
Nike’s strategies such as Consumer Direct Offence strategy, building deep personal consumer connections with their 
brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail, online and through mobile application supporterd 
Nike to stand out and becomes a top leader in sports footwear industry. The miniseries called ‘The Last Dance’ that 
aired in April 2020, helped Nike to regain their business after the Covid-19 outbreak because of the massive 
improvement of Jordan Brand sales in the market. Since then, Jordan Brand take over running as the most profitable 
products from Nike footwear.

Abstract 
Companies have been forced to adapt quickly to the Industry 4.0 paradigm in order to obtain, or at least maintain, their 
competitiveness. Digital Transformation has been one of the ways that companies have found to adapt their processes, 
to make them as effective and efficient as possible. For this, there is an emerging need for methodologies that guide 
this digitalisation processes in companies that already operate with traditional management methodologies, 
capitalising on the effort that companies have already put into philosophies such as Lean Manufacturing. This article 
aims to propose a roadmap to monitor the digitalisation of processes based on traditional management methodologies 
(PDCA, SDCA and Lean) and processes (BPM and BPMN), also presenting a tool that supports one of the steps of 
this methodology.  Aligned with this methodology and in this investigation context, a tool was also developed using 
Microsoft Excel, entitled DiYD (Do it Yourself Digitalization) which aims to help the digital transformation. This 
tool, based on a process-oriented language, was used to map the company's processes, facilitating the identification of 
their flaws and achieving opportunities for improvement. The construction of this roadmap (for the process of 
dematerialisation and digitalisation of processes) was based on a practical experience in the industrial context with 
the objective of contributing to the achievement of World Class Manufacturing status and operational excellence. In 
this way it is possible to fill the gap in the strategies for the development of digital transformation, integrating lean 
tools in its base.

Abstract 
Today's technology has experienced a fairly rapid development. This is marked by the presence of the internet which 
can facilitate communication and information for its users. And over time, some companies began to combine 
transportation and technology to meet the needs of human movement that is considered vital. This digital strategy 
also has an impact on the development of the global transportation industry. So that an online-based transportation 
service is formed, where conventional taxis are the ones that have adapted from these technological developments. 
Taxis are one of the most widely used forms of transportation in big cities. The cost of this transportation fare is 
more expensive than public transportation because taxi fares are calculated using a meter, based on the distance 
traveled. Competition for each taxi company is getting tougher because of the presence of online taxis (Grab-Car 
and Go-Car) which are more popular than conventional taxis. To compete with online taxis, taxi companies need a 
competitive strategy to develop their business. This study aims to determine the implementation of Porter's Generic 
strategy and form a SWOT analysis on conventional taxi companies in Indonesia. Based on this research, it was 
found that taxi companies implement a differentiation strategy and focus on developing mobile applications in 
ordering taxis. Therefore, this research helps to find out the right competitive strategy based on the company's 
strengths and threats.

1. Introduction
In the digital information era, the industry has experienced rapid growth in the types of business models brought 
about by digital technology (Guarda et al. 2021). If an organization cannot keep up with technological advances, the 
company will experience collapse and sales decline. One of the most powerful disruptive trends is the digital 
revolution. This revolution has become part of a new trend that adapts almost every industry. This situation has 
changed traditional industries and created new modern changes (Cahyani 2020). Digital technology enables a 
combination of radically new products or services and a go-to-market approach. As a result, the entire chain is 
affected and creates a new customer value proposition. Technology-enabled business model changes are causing 
disruption in all sectors of the global economy, including transportation companies. Even established businesses

more intense and facilities increasingly competitive between taxis. This taxi competition causes blue bird taxi profits 
to decrease every year. 
 
5.4. Effectiveness of Online Application 
Due to the presence of disruptors, Blue Bird became one of the most heavily impacted companies. Blue Bird's 
operational profit has fallen from 2015 to 2020, according to the financial reports of Blue Bird company (Figure 1). 
Blue Bird competes with local taxis and application-based transportation in numerous cities. Indonesian local 
people, especially in the city center, prefer to use “Ojek” to travel around. Ojek or motorbike taxi is more popular 
because of the fast solution in the rush hour and with cheap price. Besides that, the decline also occurred due to 
COVID-19 and the regulations that limit people's activities outside the home. However, Blue Bird was not 
deafeningly quiet. They have been catching up and beginning to develop some advancements since 2015. 
 
MyBlueBird application is one of the innovations of Blue Bird company to compete with other online-offline taxi 
companies. It is hoped that this application can increase the company's income. But in fact, the application has not 
fully provided revenues for the company. This application is still unable to compete with other competitors that offer 
multi-service technology that provides access to a wide range of services including transportation, payments, food 
delivery, logistics, and many more. As time goes by, Bluebird has collaborated with online ride-hailing platforms 
such as Gojek and Shopee to increase public interest in using Blue Bird taxis. Figure 1 represent the operational 
revenue of Blue Bird Taxi 2015-2020 in million Rupiah.

6. Conclusion  
From the analysis that has been carried out, the authors conclude that one of them is the Blue Bird taxi company 
adopting several competitive forces by Porter in running its business. Blue Bird Group performs geographic 
segmentation by selecting several cities with high mobility distribution to offer company services, as well as 
psychological segmentation by imaging itself as a ""good"" taxi service provider, so that consumers are influenced and 
give trust to the company. For the special passenger transportation business, Blue Bird categorizes its services into 
several subsidiaries for different target markets. In general, taxis that have a blue or metallic blue color target the 
general public segment. The main target of consumers with a background aged 25 years and over, as well as the 
target market for consumers who want a good quality, safe and comfortable trip. In the Executive segment, Blue 
Bird provides Silver Bird with its black fleet. 
 
The main concentration of Blue Bird company is to maintain the quality of service to customers. However, as a 
market leader, maintaining a reputation as a reliable transportation partner is not easy. Therefore, to build consumer

brand loyalty, Blue Bird implements quality control in all its business lines, from technical support to customer 
service. However, the amount of competition certainly requires a strategy to create new innovations that are right on 
target and can create a good image for the company. Competition in transportation services is currently presented 
with various choices of transportation services. To survive in the competition for transportation services, PT Blue 
Bird Tbk presents a new innovation, namely an online taxi ordering service. In 2011 Blue Bird launched a new 
innovation called the Taxi Mobile Reservation service, and due to a decrease in revenue at the company, Blue Bird 
presented an application called MyBlueBird in 2016 where this application is an attempt to change the company 
name. previous application. However, with many existing competitors such as Gojek and Grab, the competition is 
getting tougher for the transportation industry, especially PT. Blue Bird Tbk. Thus, the company needs to innovate 
in the form of collaboration with competing companies to raise their revenue.

national competitiveness (Wibowo and Nurcahyo 2020). 
Cosmetic purchasing is getting more convenient thanks to online marketplaces and the intensity of social media 
campaigns done by cosmetic brands (Laporan Tahunan Direktorat Pengawasan Kosmetik 2020). And the ability of 
local cosmetic brands to be more innovative and creative are the main factors of this increasing growth rate.

cosmetic brands in Indonesia is Wardah. Wardah is the pioneer of halal beauty product brands in Indonesia. Product 
quality, service, lifestyle and beauty advisors influence the purchasing decisions of Wardah cosmetics in Indonesia

Abstract 
Omnichannel translates to an integrated sales experience that melds the advantages of physical stores with the 
information-rich experience of online shopping.Omnichannel customers are unifying digital with the brick-and mortar 
enterprises for searching information and purchasing products. This study aims to identify motivating factors or 
determinantsfor adoption of omnichannel retailing amongst Indian customers in the context of apparel industry. It also 
analyses contextual and hierarchicalinterrelationships amongst identified determinants for developing a structural (or 
conceptual) model for omnichannel adoption of apparel retailing(OAAR) in India. The study is based on (a) 
descriptive research for identifying the determinants for adoption of omnichannel retailing, and (b)Total Interpretive 
Structural Modelling (TISM) approach to understandthe relationship structure amongst theidentified determinants and 
to develop a structural model for adoption of omnichannel retailing. Based on TISM approach followed, out of various 
identified determinants for OAAR, it appears that the determinants: technological development, improved shopping 
experience and integrated supply chain are crucial ones. These determinants also form underlying basisforhabit, 
personalization, and social influence. Based on the proposed structural model for OAAR, it is observed that 
practitioner should invest more resources to have integrated supply chain and technological capabilities such as 
customer analytics to support cross-channel fulfillments and personalization to aid adoption of omnichannel retailing 
amongst Indian customers. Further, this study positions the identified determinants in “driving”, “dependent” and 
“linkage” clusters based on the direction and intensity of their influence on other determinants using MICMAC 
analysis.

1. Introduction
Over the last few decades, retailing has gone through paramount of transformations. Starting from early mom-pop 
stores to supermarkets to online shopping to now omnichannel shopping, retail has evolved as a complex interaction. 
Omnichannel retailing is a set of activities involved in selling merchandise or services through all widespread 
channels, whereby the customer can trigger full channel integration (Levy et al. 2013). In a completely omnichannel 
approach, all channels are used simultaneously and interchangeably (Beck and Rygl 2015). This way, the convergence 
of online and offline channels offers a seamless shopping experience (Chen et al. 2018), therebyenhancing the 
omnichannel behavior. The technological adoption by omnichannel retailers enriches customerinteractionby providing 
improved shopping experience (Larke et al. 2018). However, customers find it unsatisfactory when their expectations 
are not fulfilled because of inconsistent offerings and inefficient fulfillment (Piotrowicz and Cuthbertson 2014, Ye et 
al. 2018). Such unaddressed needs of customers create hinderances in the adoption of omnichannel retailing. 
omnichannel retailers should understand the motivating factors or determinantsto engage customers seamlessly.  
Despitereflecting on the attempts of retailers in developing omnichannel aptitude and customer’s acceptance of the 
same (Verhoef et al. 2015),the intellectual and academic foundation of omnichannel adoption is rather 
underdeveloped. Most of the studies are limited to the North American or European perspectives (Galipoglu et al. 
2018).  Also, there needs to be more focus on finding the interrelationships amongst the determinants influencing 
adoption of omnichannel retailing. In this context, the study seeks to answer the following research questions: 
RQ1.What are the determinants that influence adoption of omnichannel amongst Indian customer in the context of 
apparel retailing in India?

determinantsfor OAAR. Covid19 has also driven Indian Customers to prefer omnichannel models over traditional 
store 
 
5.2 MICMAC Analysis Results 
In Figure 3, the MICMAC analysis shows that the 10 determinants can be classified in three clusters. Accordingly, 
the cluster A refers to autonomous clusters and encompasses of ‘Reduced efforts’ and ‘Enhanced promotion’. These 
determinants have weak interrelationships with other determinants in the system. Cluster B refers dependent 
determinants, which has high dependence power and low driving power. This cluster consists of ‘Improved shopping 
experience’, ‘Social influence’, ‘Habit’, and ‘Hedonistic motivation’. These determinants are significant but are 
dependent on other determinants. Generally, the determinants in linkage clusters are considered sensitive and volatile. 
As there are no determinants in linkage clusters, the system is stable.  Cluster D has high driving power and low 
dependence power. This cluster includes Technology development, Integrated supply chain, Personalization and 
Sporadic events. It indicates that if a retailer facilitates, high speed cross channel fulfillment, and use technology 
capabilities such as customer analytics to offer personalization, retailers will also boost other determinants such as 
‘improved shopping experience’ and ‘social influence’. Independent determinants in Cluster D also forms the base 
levels of the proposed structural model, thus critical for adoption of other determinants as seen in Figure 2. The 
analysis of the MICMAC results validate structural models developed with TISM approach.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study has identified unique 10 determinants for omnichannel adoption in general, particularly in a developing 
economy and specifically for apparel industry based on literature review and expert opinion. Based on the analysis of 
omnichannel literature and to the best of our knowledge, no study has considered all ‘10’ unique 
determinantsconsidered in this study for omnichannel adoption to find structural relationship amongst determinants. 
In order to build a theoretical framework, various methods exist from notionally connecting determinants to using 
ISM and TISM. Our research has focused on “what” and “how” and “why” questions by translating the feebly 
articulated relationships amongst determinants into a structured, well-defined model using combined TISM-MICMAC 
technique. 
 
The TISM approach placedthe considered determinants for OAAR in six–tier hierarchical model. The MICMAC 
analysis has positioned determinants in autonomous, dependent, independent and linkages clusters. The study has 
classified determinants according to their dependence and driving power; thus, helping decision-makers to understand 
the relative significance of each determinant.  
 
The hierarchical structural model developed using TISM approach gives a holistic picture about inherent nature and 
interrelationships amongst determinants for omnichannel retailing from customers perspective and can help retailers 
in formulating strategies for adoption of omnichannel.Out of different identified determinants for OAAR, the 
determinants: technological development, improved shopping experience and integrated supply chain are crucial ones 
according to our TISM – MICMAC analysis. 
 
As, it is impractical for practitioners to focus on all the determinants simultaneously, they can focus more on leading 
causes. Accordingly, based on the proposed structural model  for OAAR and based on the MICMAC analysis the 
retailers should focus on building integrated supply chain, building cross-channel synergies to enable high speed 
integrated fulfillment. In addition, retailer should develop technological capabilities such as customer analytics to 
provide personalized offerings. Finally, retailers should also focus on e-fulfillment because of safety concerns around 
sporadic events like covid19.   
 
The contextual and hierarchical relationships developed in this study are yet to be statistically validated. To do that a 
large number of customer data considering different customer groups based on demographics and psychographics is 
required. Further, the identified determinants are not directly measurable. That is, for each of the determinant’swe 
need to identify measurement variables to measure each determinant. These are our immediate future research agenda.

Abstract 
COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted industrial sector activities. However, one of the sectors that recorded an increase 
in performance was the health sector. Therefore, the study took the object of a company engaged in manufacturing 
medical devices located in Indonesia. This study utilizes data from the company's annual report for 2017 to 2021. 
Researchers also conducted interviews with the company's Director of Operations. With the background of different 
times and conditions with the aim of identifying strategies that are applied to different time conditions and also the 
impact of the strategy, first when the company was running operations before the COVID-19 pandemic, namely in 
2017 to 2019 where sales increased based on the annual report. then the second was during the COVID-19 pandemic 
in 2020 where the company reached a record high in sales and the third was in 2021 when the government entered a 
time when the government shifted priorities from handling the COVID-19 pandemic to efforts to recover the 
economy. This incident caused an oversupply of medical equipment, resulting in an income of IDR 35 billion. In 
2022, the company is trying to adapt to the Indonesian government's program to create a new campaign to prevent 
stunting in children under five years of age.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 epidemic began in China in late 2019. By the end of the first quarter of 2020, the epidemic hasbeen 
declared as a widespread pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has spread all over the 
world. One of the countries affected by the pandemic is Indonesia, which reported its first case in March, 2020.  
This pandemic is not only endangering human lives, but it is also disrupting the activities of various industrial 
sectors around the world, as most governments around the world have been forced to close their borders and lock 
down their countries in an attempt to isolate themselves and prevent the virus from spreading. The reduction in 
industrial and human activities in general, combined with the country’s emergency healthcare expense led to 
multiple problems such as supply chain disruption (Inoue et al. 2021) and economic recession. In Indonesia, 
COVID-19 pandemic also has negative impact on most of the industrial sector, many businesses have reported 
plunging performance drop as an effect of social restriction that is implemented by the Indonesian government in 
order to stop the virus from spreading. But there is a certain sector that has improvement in performance because of 
high demand, that is healthcare sector. This sector included chemical, pharmacy, traditional medicine, and medical 
equipment industry (Kemenperin 2020; Setyowati and Elfiana 2022). 
During the COVID-19 epidemic, global health systems were put under unprecedented strain, with many health and 
social care professionals experiencing a lack of personal protective equipment (Vallatos et al. 2021). The extremely 
high demand provided to be a good fortune for medical device manufacturers, especially for manufacturer that is 
focused on producing personal protective equipment, and other medical equipment that is used to treat those who are 
affected by the pandemic such as sterilizers and ventilators (U.S. FDA 2022). The needs for medical device software 
that is used to track, monitor, and produce data for analysis related to pandemic is also increased. (Son 2020). In 
2020, as an effort to prevent COVID-19 essential needs shortages, Indonesian government restricts export of 
surgical mask, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer, and raw material for making surgical mask. The 
government also ease the bureaucracy for medical equipment manufacturer so they can produce COVID-19 essential

equipment (CNBC Indonesia, 2021). They also perform an acquisition on other Indonesian medical device 
manufacturer called PT Oneject Indonesia (Oneject). Oneject is the biggest Auto Disable Syringe (ADS) 
manufacturer in Asia (Kontan 2021). This acquisition can be rated as successful as IRRA record a 18% increase in 
Q1 YoY revenue in 2022 (Trenasia 2022). The strategy of this company can be identified as related diversification 
and horizontal integration, and are performing exceptionally well. 
When compared with these companies, it can be said that COVID-19 pandemic brings an opportunity to medical 
equipment company including PT BIPMED. PT BIPMED and the other companies have a different approach and 
strategy to adapt with the evolving market and needs during the pandemic, and therefore, it yields a different result 
for all. 
5. Conclusion
From this study, it can be concluded that during the year 2017 to 2019 before the pandemic occurs, the company 
implemented a market development and diversification strategy as intended, there is no disrupting phenomenon that 
would force the company to change its strategy. The primary reason for the company to use these strategies are 
market demand and trends. The strategy they’re using provided to be useful because the company recorded a IDR16 
Billion increase in revenue from 2017 to 2019. 
During the first year of COVID-19 in 2020 where most companies struggle to survive, PT BIPMED thrive because 
its product are much needed, and they able to adapt with the presented opportunities by implementing product 
development as an emergent strategy. This strategy is able to give a positive impact on the company’s performance, 
where they recorded an all-time high YoY revenue in 2020. 
The year after (2021), when the country’s economy is recovering. The shift in Indonesian government’s priority 
from COVID-19 pandemic relief to economic recovery attempt, had a negative implication on the company and 
Indonesian medical equipment sector as a whole. Because the state budget had to be allocated into other sector 
making the government will not buy any non-essential medical equipment. This event creates an oversupply of 
medical equipment, making the company suffer a decrease of IDR35 Billion in revenue. 
In 2022, the Indonesian governments made a new campaign in preventing a stunting in children under five years old. 
PT BIPMED adapt with this trend by developing a related product in its existing baby incubator. 
According to the comparative analysis, it can be concluded that different company have its own approach and 
strategy when addressing the evolving market and needs during COVID-19 pandemic. 
This research contributes to the scarce literature of emergent strategy. Lastly, the limitation of this research is that 
researchers only examine one company that produces and sells medical equipment in Indonesia only comparing with 
two other medical equipment company in Indonesia, but is very different is scale. PT Oksigen Medika Teknik is a 
smaller company than PT BIPMED, but IRRA is a much bigger company than PT BIPMED. Another limitation is 
that the methods used are limited to semi-structured interviews and descriptive statistics. 
Therefore, the recommendation for the next research is to examine more companies in the medical equipment 
industry on the same scale and size, and also preferably with the same types of main products (for example: in PT 
BIPMED’s case, their main line of products are medical beds and other furniture). Then an industrial analysis can 
also be carried out using Porter's five forces to further examine the condition of the medical equipment industry.

Abstract 
Generation Z (Gen Z) is expected to reach 2.56 billion individuals globally by 2020 and estimated to occupy 20% of 
work- place. Each generation has its unique ability and competency. Leveraging them is a key to the success of an 
organization. Gen Z is known to be more risk-averse, have lower expectations, confident but cautious, demanding. 
This generation is known as digitally naïve and hyper-connected junkies. Their attention span is short and need 
extensive feedback, but not micromanagement. Gen Z prefers face-to-face interactions. With those characteristics, 
this study aims to see what leadership style is effective for Gen Z.  A qualitative study was conducted to 92 Gen Z see 
the frequent keyword to identify the effective leadership style.  Voyant analytical tools was used to analyze the 
keywords. The most frequent keywords mentioned were friendly, good, humble, wise, polite, honest, providing, 
supportive, understanding, caring, giving and appreciate.  However, words such as encouraging, challenging were not 
mentioned at all.  Therefore, according to the keyword finding, the effective leadership style is servant leadership. 
Keywords 
Generation Z, leadership, servant leadership, transformational 
1. Introduction
Regarding leadership styles, literature brings several types, such as authoritarian, charismatic, situational, visionary, 
contingency, behavioral, transactional among others (Northouse 2019). Among the 66 leadership styles indicated by 
Dinh et al. (2014) in (Girardi and Rubim Sarate 2021), transformational leadership is the most emphasized, which 
have been growing rapidly since the 1990s, especially in studies that investigate how these studies promote better 
performance in organizations (Girardi and Rubim Sarate 2021). However, difference situation requires different type 
of leadership. 
With different traits, way of thinking, lifestyle, belief, Gen Z might need a certain type of leadership that make the 
work effectively.  Gen Z are known to be the first global citizen due to the advancement of internet and technology. 
Therefore, they communicate mostly with the support of the technology.  They depend on technology for almost every 
aspect of their life (Dwidienawati & Gandasari, 2018).  However, because they were born and raised during economic 
downturn, Gen Z more realistic compared to Gen Y.  They are also more risk-averse than earlier generation.  They 
have lower expectation, cautious and less entitled (Tulgan 2013).  They are easily bored, therefore, they expect to have 
different job role and flexibility (Dwidienawati and Gandasari 2018). They want instant success. They are self-reliant 
but still need guidance and frequent feedback and tap in the back (Stillman & Stillman, 2017), however, they do not 
like micromanagement. They also need superior that they respect in order to work effectively (Dwidienawati and 
Gandasari 2018).  It seemed that Gen Z require different style of leadership.  Currently in Scopus database in beginning 
of May 2022, there were only 34 literatures on “Generation Z” and “leadership” 
1.1 Objectives  
This study aims to identify which leadership style is the most effective according to Gen Z.  This study will contribute 
for the literature of leadership and generation cohort.

6. Conclusion 
The qualitative study conducted to generation Z showed that based on the keywords analysis the effective leadership 
style for them is servant leadership style.  The words analysis showed that words which represent empowering (such 
as giving chance, opportunity, able), humility (such as humble, friendly, kind, good, nice, polite), authentic (such as 
responsible, fair), acceptance (such as accept, mistakes, forgive), direction (such as guidance, communication, discuss, 
feedback), and stewardship (such as giving, providing, support) are occurred frequently.   Therefore, it can be 
concluded that the effective leadership for Gen Z is a servant leader. 
 
This study, however, did not see the relationship between servant leadership and work effectiveness.  Therefore, 
further quantitative study is recommended to confirm the relationship.  This study also only used questionnaire, 
therefore the deep understanding why Gen Z mentioned certain characteristic cannot be explored.  Further study with 
deep interview method should be conducted to understand the reasoning further.

Abstract 
Additive manufacturing has been recognized for its potential to support sustainable production. The literature shows 
that even though the additive manufacturing industry has proven disruptive potential regarding the incorporation of 
waste materials as material inputs for its processes, there is a lack of research when exploring industrial symbiosis 
networks within the additive manufacturing industry (Ferreira et al. 2021) – designated in this research as additive 
symbiotic networks. This exploratory research intends to promote the development of additive symbiotic networks. 
Considering the exchange of resources between the different stakeholders that form a symbiotic network, there is a 
need to find tools that support the implementation of transactions within the network. The blockchain technology has 
been acknowledged as an enabler to assure trust and transparency of entities and transactions, and thus, it can be used 
to boost the development of additive symbiotic networks (Gonçalves et al. 2022). Preliminary results from this 
research tend to confirm that this technology meets the requirements for developing additive symbiotic networks. 
Despite its potential benefits, adopting the blockchain technology is expected to impact the supply chain structure of 
an additive symbiotic network, namely in the power distribution among the stakeholders of the network. Future 
research work is suggested to explore the development of a blockchain-based architecture to support the 
implementation of an additive symbiotic network. By developing two case studies representing two additive symbiotic 
networks, this research seeks to revitalize global partnerships for the development and strengthening of global 
sustainability.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic has crippled the economy's most important sectors. People have been forced to stay at home 
due to the implementation of the Large-Scale Social Restriction (PSBB). Meanwhile, they were required to preserve 
their health and well-being to avoid becoming infected with the Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19). One of the 
numerous strategies to avoid a viral assault is to exercise; during the pandemic, the majority of the population chooses 
cycling as their form of exercise. As a result of this situation, demand for bicycles and their replacement parts is 
increasing, even though their prices are also rising. This phenomenon has the potential to boost the income of bicycle 
companies. This study observed which Porter’s Strategy were used by bicycle companies and discovered the impact 
of the strategy during Covid-19 pandemic.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 shocked the world. In March 2020, Indonesia recorded its first 
Covid-19 patient in Depok, West Java. The Indonesian government implemented large-scale social restriction (PSBB) 
in late April 2020 as a precaution of transmission Covid-19 virus. Within this PSBB, there are health protocols applied 
to all Indonesians, such as washing hands regularly, maintaining the distances, and wearing face masks (Ramdani 
2020). Many people tend to do a lot of activities at home such as studying, working, and even praying. 
To prevent Covid-19, people need to increase their immune system. One of the activities to increase their immune 
system is by exercising (Hadi 2020). People began to improvise so that they could exercise even if they had to stay at 
home; nevertheless, people eventually reached a tedium phase and didn’t have desire anymore to continue exercising 
at home, so they began exploring for sorts of sports that could be done outside while still adhering to the health 
protocols. 
Exercise that still obeys health protocols is cycling. Many fitness-starved Indonesians turned to cycling for outdoor 
exercise when areas of the country were ordered to stay at home and health clubs were shuttered to help prevent the 
spread of the coronavirus, resulting in a rise in bike sales. In reaction to the epidemic, COVID-19 saw a significant 
surge in bicycle sales. Rapid changes in consumer needs and product diversity make market conditions more 
competitive (Wibowo and Nurcahyo 2020). Due to increased worry about public transit and an increase in activity, an 
increasing number of people are opting for one of the most basic modes of transportation. 
Together with the high public interest in cycling activities, it also gives an impact to enhancement of bicycle 
manufacturing company performance. Corporate viability plays an important role in one firm strategy during 
pandemic (Nurcahyo, 2019), that makes bicycle companies need to develop appropriate strategies to deal with the 
increasing complexity of manufacturing (Saptioratri Budiono et al. 2021).This study will discuss the performance of 
several bicycle companies in the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how that several companies implement 
Porter's strategy to maintain their existence. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 literature review about two major bicycle companies and 
Porter’s generic strategies. Section 3 methodology stage for this paper. Section 4 data collection to support this study.

905","Not only produce a bicycle, but Shimano also provide bicycle’s gear and brake as service components. To make 
customer satisfy with their product, Shimano put some technology in their product, named Digital Integrated 
Intelligence (Di2), Shimano Wheel Technology, and Shimano E-Bike Technology. With that kind of technologies, it 
makes Shimano’s product become different with their competitor, and could gain more advantage. As a result of their 
unique (different) products, and promotion (marketing) effort, Shimano could achieve growth in their overall business 
that represented by annual report in 2021. 
Relating to their performance, Shimano and Brompton have similarity in positive profit during Covid-19 pandemic. 
As we can see from each of their annual report, known that Shimano and Brompton could achieve better result of 
gross profit in 2021 compared by 2020. In this case, their strategy make Shimano and Brompton could still exist even 
get better result in Covid-19 pandemic.  
Also, there is interesting fact between Shimano and Brompton performance during 2021. In this case, Brompton’s 
gross profit in 2021 is £37,348,381, meanwhile Shimano’s gross profit in 2021 is ¥ 231,417,000,000 (conversion to 
pound sterling same with £1,422,278,742. This value of gross profit could be different because Shimano’s product not 
only bicycle and its components, but also fishing and rowing equipment, meanwhile on the other side Brompton only 
produce special folding bicycle and its accessories. In total Shimano got better profit in 2021 if compared with 
Brompton. 
6. Conclusion
Two major bicycle companies, Brompton and Shimano adopt two different Porter’s Strategies. Without lowering their 
prices and quality of their products, Brompton using Focus – Best Value strategy. Meanwhile, Shimano with their 
variations of their products is using Differentiation strategy. During the Covid-19 pandemic, even using two different 
strategies, both companies’net sales still increasing.However, the investigation of this study is based on secondary 
data that collected from both companies’ annual report during Covid-19 pandemic (2020-2021). 
This study is limited to two major bicycle companies and the data collection is from annual report. To obtain more 
detailed data in further research, primary data is needed and may also require opinions from decision makers in the 
company and experts.

Abstract 
Tipping phenomenon has been widely observed with broad social-economic impacts. Digital nudging using ‘default 
tip options’ on iPad-like payment devices is increasingly adopted by the service providers, in order to increase the size 
of the tip that can greatly impact service industry worker’s income. The current practice is to use one set of standard 
‘default tip options’ regardless of whatever kind of service to be delivered. This paper proposes a data-driven approach 
to designing smart tipping nudge that enables customized ‘default tip options’ tailored to varying tendency of different 
services for potentially high or low tip amounts. For a behavioral economic analysis of the tipping behavior, we apply 
prospect-theoretic value functions to model the tip amount as the consumer perceived value of service quality. A field 
experimental study in a fast-causal business is reported to demonstrate the potential of the proposed data-driven 
approach to smart tip nudging.

1. Introduction
Tipping phenomenon has attracted a large body of studies in behavioral economics and experimental psychology. 
Diverse tipping practices are observed from culture to culture or country to country (Saayman and Saayman, 2015). 
It is reported that tipping in the United States food industry alone accounted for a $46.6 billion economic value (Azar, 
2011), whilst 3 out of 4.7 million food servers employed in the USA earn some portion of their income from tips 
(Miller, 2010). With broader social-economic impacts, tipping has profound implications for labor economics as well 
as economics of information and management strategies (Azar, 2003).  
Numerous literature has been devoted to understanding various social-demographic variables that affect people’s 
tipping behaviors (Lynn, 2006). For example, Green et al. (2003) find that the percentage of tips decreases with the 
bill size, which coincides with an economic concept of free-riding (Nelson, 2017). A situation where tipping is 
involved typically consists of two main parties that affect the prevalence or size of the tip: the consumer or demand 
side and the service provider or supply side (Azar, 2007). On the demand side, age, gender, education, culture, mood, 
and other variables can impact the size of the tip given. Regardless, tipping is a behavior that is motivated more by 
the positive results rather than being restricted by the negative results of not tipping. There are no consequences for 
not tipping, so the action of tipping is a way to express gratitude on top of the base cost of the product.  On the supply 
side, attitude, appearance, and other variables can impact the size of the tip received.  
A nationwide tipping field study based on 40 million Uber trips reveals that both consumer traits and service provider 
traits contribute to the amount of tip given, while demand-side variables matter more (Chandar et al., 2019). The study 
finds that the knowledge of certain patterns in the tipping behavior can be used to maximize tips. While service 
providers cannot change the consumer’s traits, the service provider can manipulate certain aspects of their service 
operations to gain a larger tip. For example, service providers can provide faster or cleaner service, greet the customers,

To validate the proposed approach, the pseudo dataset is used for neural network training and testing. The database 
consists of 6,000 transactions and 48 attributes, including 6 service workers, 8 drink recipes, 12 toppings, 6 sweetness 
levels, 4 ice levels, along with 12 tip percentage values.  
 
The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a 6:2:2 ratio for model training. The training curve 
is shown in Figure 7. After around 34 epochs, the model reaches around 88.74% accuracy on the testing dataset, 
suggesting the proposed neural network-based data-driven approach is effective for tip nudging design. 
 
It should be noted that the model has overfitting issues after 40 epochs, suggesting this model complexity is enough 
to explain factors and patterns that influence the tip behavior with given data. Factor analysis can be further conducted 
to find significant factors and to simplify the model. In the meantime, other data, like service transaction time, can be 
included as additional factors that enable the tip nudging mechanism with more context-awareness.

To test the significance of the resulted smart tipping nudge, we organized a focus group with 20 participants to run a 
controlled experiment, as shown in Table 3. Each participant responded to each scenario (standard/smart nudge) by 
ordering one type of drinks each time. Overall each participant placed 6 orders of 3 types of drinks twice. Each drink 
type received 20 orders for the standard or smart nudge scenario, totaling 40 orders. After randomly 6 runs of the 
experiment, the statistics of average tip amount for the standard and smart nudge cases are 12.34% and 17.86%, 
respectively. The experiment concluded that the smart nudge outperform the standard nudge case.

6. Conclusions 
There are varying perspectives on the correlation between tipping and service quality in the literature. While some 
studies suggest the connection between service quality and tip sizes is tenuous at best (Lynn, 2001), other studies 
conclude the opposite (Bodvarsson and Gibson, 1999), or argue if it is because of a weak relationship or just weak 
measurement (Lynn, 2003). Our prospect-theoretic modeling finds out that the process of delivering a service results 
in fulfillment of service value added and this is perceived as the prevalence of tipping. In addition, the tip size is 
correlated to quality of service in line with a prospect theory value function. These behavioral economic findings shed 
light on developing insights into the underlying mechanism of the tipping behavior.  
 
The prevailing behavioral economic and experimental psychology studies on the tipping behavior are mainly empirical 
and focus on understanding human social factors that affect tipping. There are limited formal guidelines or

design perspective through smart tip nudging. Designing a smart tipping nudge improves the current practice of using 
one set of standard ‘default tip options’ regardless of whatever kind of service delivered. The end result is envisioned 
to be customized ‘default tip options’ tailored to varying tendency of different services for potentially high or low tip 
amounts. This is conducive to better user experience on the consumer side, while bringing better chance of higher tips 
on the supply side. 
 
Traditional tipping behavior research is dominated by experimental studies, in which limited sample sizes or subjective 
surveys tend to be biased and difficult to generalize or even validate the findings. The proposed data-driven approach 
indicates the great potential to embrace data analytics, machine learning and AI technologies, given pervasive 
connectivity, massive data and smart sensor technologies widely available in nowadays business operations. For 
example, data-driven parameter tuning lends itself to be a promising means to enhance the prospect-theoretic value 
function formulation to model irrational decision making underlying a number of social-economic phenomena.

Abstract 
Evaluation of the Hospital Information System (HIS) performance is important considering that it is one of the 
important aspects in realizing fast service, minimal medical errors, and providing information disclosure to transparent 
operational cost control. The study aims to determine user acceptance, HIS performance, and challenges in its 
development in 2 Jambi Provincial Government Hospitals. This quantitative study included hospital staff who were 
selected purposively and in-and-out patients were selected by simple randomness according to Lemeshow's number. 
The concept of Technology Acceptance Models (TAM) is used to determine the acceptance of hospital information 
system technology by officers. The quality of the information system according to the D&M Success Model is to 
determine the performance of the HIS used. The Service Quality (Servqual) dimension uses Important-Performance 
Analysis (IPA) analysis to determine the priority attributes of HIS development. The results showed Hospital 
Information System at 2 (two) public hospitals in Jambi Province has user acceptance. Based on HIS performance, 
Raden Mattaher Hospital’s excellence on system speed but low relevance, however H. Hanafie Hospital’s was good 
at completeness but lacks accuracy. HIS development priority attributes were based on the patient’s hope related to 
knowledge, attitude, and practice (behavior) from health workers in giving information applied to Raden Mattaher 
Hospital while providing infrastructure expected at the H. Hanafie Hospital. It is important to address the challenge 
of HIS development by strengthening practice effort and the accelerated speed system in Raden Mattaher Hospital 
while increasing HIS physical proof and accuracy in H. Hanafie Hospital.

1. Introduction
The complexity of services in hospitals, including government hospitals, is a challenge in realizing fast services, 
minimal medical errors, providing open and timely access to information, and transparent operational cost control. 
These challenges can be answered through an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) approach, where 
the use of ICT has become an important aspect in the development of the global health world, including in hospitals 
(Hack et al. 2011; Alipour et al. 2016; Setyohadi and Purnamawati 2018).

Abstract 
The focus of manufacturing organisations on their core competencies has placed third-party logistics service providers 
(3PL) in an ideal position to deal with supportive activities such as material handling, transportation, and storage using 
their expertise and economies of scale. This study considers the problem of determining the optimal fleet size of 
heterogeneous trucks to be outsourced from a 3PL to fulfil the demand of various raw materials requirements by a 
production facility while achieving a minimum total cost of these daily operations. Trucks are deployed in an inter-
facility material transportation system with different raw materials from designated storage areas to be transported to 
specified buffer locations per the production requirements. In a typical material forward flow, a truck undergoes many 
sub-processes with stochastic service times that vary with the type of material it carries and the type of the truck. Each 
material encompasses different physical attributes and specific job routings. Within this context, the inter-facility 
transportation process is modelled as a closed queueing network (CQN), and a mathematical model is developed to 
determine the optimal number of heterogeneous trucks to be outsourced from a 3PL while fulfilling the production 
requirements. A Discrete event simulation model, using Anylogic simulation software, is employed for solving the 
model to determine the optimal fleet size of trucks and their specific heterogeneous composition. Moreover, the 
simulation model is used to determine the main performance measures of the system, such as sub-process response 
times, queue lengths, cycle times, resource utilisations and bottlenecks, to assist in the decision-making process.

This study considers the fleet sizing problem of homogeneous trucks to be outsourced (or subcontracted) from a third-
party logistics provider to be used daily to transport different types of raw materials from designated storage yards to 
intermediate buffer locations to be fed as inputs to a production facility for processing.Within this context, the problem 
is modelled as a closed queueing network (CQN). A Discrete event simulation model using Anylogic simulation 
software, is employed for solving the model to find the optimal number of trucks and composition of the trucks. 
Moreover, the simulation model is used to determine the performance measures of the system such as response times, 
cycle times, resource utilisations and bottlenecks to assist in the decision-making process.

Abstract 
Forecasting for passenger demand in a new railway service is a challenging activity. There are many variables that 
could affect the number of passengers that will use railway services and many of those variables may be unique to 
each specific situation. In this study, we present a study that attempts to forecast railway passengers for a newly 
constructed railway line of Makassar – Parepare in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. We propose a combination of the 
System Dynamics and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The system dynamics is a simulation method that is used 
to generate a set of training data for the ANN. The initial data were collected through a survey of willingness to use

Figure 6. Forecast Passenger Demand in One Period and One Price 
 
If we look at the computation in one week of departure, it is known that the tendency of customers is between 11,400 
at a price of IDR 500 to 2000 customers at a price of IDR 13.500 every 20 kilometers. The increase is partially 
influenced by the population growth rate in South Sulawesi and the improvement of supporting rail services that will 
attract public interest to use rail services and especially influenced by fare rate in 20 kilometers. This trend draws a 
conclusion that tickets per day that are sold if only consist of 5 working days are effectively around 2280 - 4000 per 
day, along Makassar – Pare-Pare link, assuming that the number of passengers is spread evenly among different days 
 
8. Conclusion 
This paper proposes a new approach for forecasting passenger demand by combining the system dynamics and 
artificial neural network. The system dynamics is used to generate initial data and this initial data can be used for 
training and testing purposes in the artificial neural network.The proposed approach is used to forecast passenger 
demand of a newly constructed railway that connects Makassar and Parepare in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. In order 
to run the model, we collect both secondary and primary data. We predict the passenger demand under different price 
scenario. We have used the survey results that predict the willingness to use and willingness to pay as input to the 
model. As a snapshot, the estimated passenger demand is in the range of 2000 to 11400 tickets sold in a week, 
depending on the ticket price.

Abstract 
Pandemic situation forced all of people to work remotely. People depend on information technology to be able to work 
remotely. Telecommunication industries which an industry that contributes to the success of implementation 
information technology on remote working, have an increase in terms of demand due to the pandemic. AS result 
telecommunication industries must align their strategic implementation to their strategic formulation to enable survive 
the pandemic conditions. This paper will look and analyze how telecommunications industry in Indonesia refine their 
strategic implementation to their strategic formulation to answer the pandemic challenge. It was found that 
telecommunications industry that aligning their strategic implementation to their strategic formula, have a significant 
effect on their revenue on pandemic and post-pandemic era.

1. Introduction
Telecommunication Industries in Indonesia has been improved so fast due to digitalization especially in during the 
pandemic. The Pandemic becoming a world citizen to di “Stay at Home” on daily basis, many organizations did a 
“Work from home” style to decrease the spread of the virus (Wu et al., 2020).  In this case, pandemic becomes an 
accelerator of digital transformation and of course they must provide top-notch service to support the transformation 
and achieve competitive advantage on market share in the time of crisis(Reuschl et al. 2022). Besides, traditional 
communication services periodically decline in service traffic due to acceleration of digital ecosystem (Pramudita and 
Nurcahyo 2019).  Openness of international market to Indonesia also a trigger for telecommunication company to 
speed up their global transformation (Wibowo and Nurcahyo 2020). To enhance the company's competitiveness, it is 
important for a telecommunication company to foster sense of innovation to improve their services (Nurcahyo et al. 
2021). 
There are many options of telecommunication services in Indonesia, one of them are Indosat, & XL Axiata. According 
to Databooks Katadata they served 286.27 million consumers in Juni 2021. 169,2 consumers were led by state owned 
telecommunications company, followed by Indosat 60.3 million, and XL Axiata 56.77 million as shown in Figure 1.

T-test p-value of pandemic

From Table 5, the p-value of t-test in pre-pandemic era show 0.434 which larger than 0.05. It can be concluded that 
there is no significant difference between the revenue of company that align the implementation of strategic 
formulation more precise and the less one. It is possible because of in Pre-pandemic era, the needs of people with 
telecommunication services are normal, and people still could afford more expensive serviceswithout considering 
another need. 
 
Interesting results show when the era shifts from pre-pandemic to pandemic and post pandemic. The p-value of t-test 
in pandemic and post pandemic era is 0.006 and 0.039 which are below the level of significance. The box plot of 
revenue differences is shown in Figure 4. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Box plot of revenue difference between XL and Indosat in 3 pandemic phases 
 
This concludes that there are significant differences between the revenue of companies that align the implementation 
of strategic formulation more precisely and the less one. This can be caused by several factor, the major factor is in 
Q3 Post-pandemic era, Indosat merge with Hutchinson 3 Indonesia which give Indosat opportunities to have varies of 
telecommunication products that Hutchinson sell before, this align with Indosat first mission which wants to be Leader 
in Providing Digital Touch Points. Also, Indosat gains operational benefit from the merger of Indosat and Hutchinson. 
Indosat will gain the ownership of Hutchinson Base Transceiver Station (BTS) which Indosat coverage larger than 
before. Through the merger activityIndosat also could shutdown duplicated infrastructure so it could cut operational 
costs more. The merger activity also aligns with Indosat second mission statement which is Strong Player in Key 
Geographies. In other hand XL try to merge with LinkNet the one of leading Enterprise Internet Services Provider in 
Indonesia to variate their product and to spread their services coverage. This step is still in progress and predicted to 
close the deal at Q3 of 2022. 
 
6. Conclusion 
COVID-19 is a blessing in disguise for telecomunication industry, As more businesses enable remote work and 
consumers switch to unlimited plans, they can support remote working across all industries as long they can adapt to 
strategic implementation allign with vision & mission Statements. From the Result and discussion section above it 
can be concluded that XL and Indosat have form their vision statement unique and global, so it can be a good 
foundation for mission statement, and Indosat have more detailed mission statement than XL have. Also based on 
Porter Generic Strategies, XL maintain three strategies (cost leadership, cost focus, differentiation focus) then Indosat 
maintain one strategy (cost leadership), Indosat focus on develop one strategy reflect to more align with the company 
mission. By Aligning strategic implementation with strategic formulation plays key role in gaining revenue, can be 
concluded from the result of t-test in pandemic and post pandemic, there are significant differences between the 
revenue of company that align the implementation of strategic formulation more precise and the less one.The limitation 
of this research was focusing only on revenue performance. We emphasize the empirical study about the

Abstract 
The competition in the logistics space in Indonesia can be divided on the basis of different service segments including 
freight forwarding, contract logistics (warehousing), and express delivery. In contract Logistics (warehousing) there 
are 16 international logistics companies were evaluated in Gartner Magic Quadrant report, with one of them is DHL 
Supply Chain. The main purpose of this research is to analyze PT DHL Supply Chain strategy in technology sector. 
Based on the SWOT analysis obtained by DHL Supply Chain has great operating power, a combination of physical 
and digital supply chain, the use of technological innovation to increase efficiency, and the existence of value-added 
activity services as a competitive advantage. Based on the results of the analysis using the RBV approach and SWOT 
analysis, it can be concluded that the DHL Supply Chain business strategy applies the Porter's Differentiation strategy.

1. Introduction
Logistics is essentially a planning orientation and framework that seeks to create a single plan for the flow of products 
and information through a business. Supply chain management builds upon this framework and seeks to achieve 
linkage and co-ordination between the processes of other entities in the pipeline, i.e. suppliers and customers, and the 
organization itself (Christopher 2011). Logistics involves an integrated approach with the integration of information, 
transportation, inventory, warehousing, material handling, value added services and packaging. There are varying 
definitions due to the varying scope and understanding of logistics. At present, in every country dealing with the so-
called globalization era. Globalization is changing the way companies do their business as usual because of the 
openness of international markets, openness of information, the use of low resource costs in developing countries and 
efficient supply chain systems (Wibowo and Nurcahyo 2020). 
The competition in the Logistics space in Indonesia can be divided on the basis of different service segments including 
freight forwarding, contract logistics (warehousing), and express delivery. Domestic and international players such as 
Seino Indomobile, CKB logistics, Lookman Djaja, Linfox Logistics, Kuehne + Nagel, DB Schenker, DHL, Agility 
were identified to be dominant when it comes to freight forwarding and warehousing, as they  have a strong brand 
name in the global and local market for their quality services. While for the future growth it estimate that the logistics 
sector in Indonesia is expected to grow in the future with a dip in 2020 due to a lockdown for few months that disrupted 
the imports and export movements by all modes which is expected to revive back in 2021. Tech startups are filling 
the gap and capturing new business opportunities. Several key technologies deployed by logistics startups include 
radio frequency identification (RFID), GPS, cloud computing, and data analytics (Narula 2020).  
In contract Logistics (warehousing) there are 16 international logistics companies were evaluated in Gartner Magic 
Quadrant report, with one of them is DHL Supply Chain. DHL Supply Chain, the contract logistics arm from Deutsche 
Post DHL Group, has been named a leader in the June 2021 Magic Quadrant for third-party logistics, Worldwide. 
Gartner, the leading research and advisory company, annually evaluates third-party logistics providers worldwide 
based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute. Competitiveness is one of an organization goal. In this 
era, such goal can be achieved by entering the customer image and keeping its loyalty. In order to do this, companies

together with the apparent vulnerability of tranditional supply chain set-ups, will increase the demand for flexible and 
agile solutions, driving outsourcing. Therefore the market for contract logistics is likely to continue growing. 
 
Threats: contract logistics industry is a large industry with many competitors in it. Many competitors are local and 
international. The threat that arises is in the form of many competitors who offer contract logistics services at lower 
costs regardless of whether the quality is good or bad. Then, with the use of information technology, of course, there 
is also the risk of cyber attacks that can break into and access company data. 
 
5.  Conclusion 
The score from the IFE Matrix proves that DHL Supply Chain already has a strong internal position. Then based on 
the SWOT analysis obtained by DHL Supply Chain has great operating power, a combination of physical and digital 
supply chain, the use of technological innovation to increase efficiency, and the existence of value-added activity 
services as a competitive advantage. Based on the results of the analysis using the RBV approach and SWOT analysis, 
it can be concluded that the DHL Supply Chain business strategy applies the Porter's Differentiation strategy. 
Differentiation strategy at producing products and services considered unique industry-wide and directed at consumers 
who are relatively price-insensitive (David 2011). However, the researcher also argues that with all the operations and 
services offered, there seems to be a combination that leads to a focus strategy. This is arguably not good because the 
contract logistics industry is actually a large industry with many competitors, so DHL Supply Chain is also advised to 
maintain the price of its services. 
 
Then in the 2020-2021 pandemic, the increase in e-commerce has also led to an increase in market contract logistics 
in the technology sector, in the discussion of marketing and market share obtained by DHL Supply Chain, it is also 
known that DHL Supply Chain adopts intensive market penetration strategies.

Introduction 
Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMEs) are expected to have a market-renewing and opportunity-capturing 
strategy. Pressures and global commercial competition, such as the Covid 19 pandemic, technical advancements, 
demographic and societal changes, the ability to innovate, financial support, and entrepreneurship, impact Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SMEs). (Ganlin et al. 2021). However, small and medium-sized enterprises continue to find it 
challenging to satisfy the expectations of the current business environment. Small and Medium-Sized Businesses with 
low-quality human resources, such as a lack of qualified personnel and a lack of business orientation, find it 
challenging to develop in the market. Companies with a robust entrepreneurial mindset will innovate more effectively 
than other businesses. Entrepreneurial Orientation (E.O.) is crucial for economic expansion, innovation, and 
employment (Mthanti & Ojah  2017). 
Entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial orientation are the two most frequently researched performance 
variables. Motivation to start a business is easily defined as the drive or purpose for a person to do so. (Murnieks et 
al.  2020). Motivation is sometimes divided into two main groups: opportunity motivation, which is connected with 
individuals who opt to establish their own enterprises in response to perceived entrepreneurial prospects. Second, the 
need motive is related to persons who show enterprises because alternative career opportunities do not exist or are not 
satisfactory. (Nguyen et al.  2019). It is crucial to analyze business motivation and orientation: understanding these 
motives and behaviors helps to comprehend how they connect to the owner's everyday operations and fit into the 
surrounding environment.

1. Introduction
The medical services industry in Indonesia is a tantalizing speculative opportunity as the development of this industry 
has driven demand in almost all parts of the business from clinics to medicines to clinical gadgets. This increase in 
demand will increase the income of the medical services industry and attract Indonesians seeking clinical therapy 
abroad to spend domestically. More than 1.2 million Indonesians spend more than US$2 billion annually on medical 
care overseas, mainly in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia(Medina  2020).  
The increasing demand for the medical equipment industry is a breath of fresh air for players in this industry, one of 
them is PT. Abadi CitaSelaras (PT. ACS) whichis located in South Tangerang City, Banten Province, Indonesia. This 
company is a distributor of medical equipment, including guiding catheters, manifolds, infusion sets, latex gloves, and 
masks.Becausethe company has just launched a new guiding catheter product with the Asahi Sion Blue and 
Cordisbrands and its sales are not yet stable, therefore it is necessary to investigate how customers are engaged with 
these new brands. 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of this study is to observe the influence of brand psychological ownership to customer brand 
engagement, value congruity to customer engagement, customer brand engagement to brand attachment, customer 
brand engagement to brand loyalty, brand psychological ownership to customer brand attachment, and value congruity 
to brand loyalty.  
2. Literature Review

6. Conclusion 
This study especially analyzed the effects of brand psychological ownership to customer brand engagement, value 
congruity to customer brand engagement, customer brand engagement to brand attachment, customer brand 
engagement to brand loyalty, brand psychological ownership to customer brand attachment, and value congruity to 
brand loyalty are positive and significant. The highest indicator based on filling out the questionnaire is in the customer 
brand engagement variable, namely using the brand gets to think about the brand, which means that customers are 
happy to use the brand and the impact will remember the brand, so companies need to increase brand awareness to 
customers.While the indicator that has the lowest score is commitment feelings towards the brand which is an indicator 
of the brand loyalty variable which shows that customers are less committed to the brand so that the company needs 
to improve the quality of its products so that customers are committed to using the company's brand.

industry, notably in the aviation industry. The goal of this research is to determine the strategy of aviation MRO 
companies in Indonesia prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, throughout the pandemic year, and when the pandemic cases 
started to fall, as well as to understand the influence of this strategy on corporate performance. This study was 
conducted by directly interviewing the company's Director of Operations. The analysis determined that the company 
employed a Cost Leadership strategy, and the company's success in winning tenders in 2015, 2018, and 2020 
demonstrated that the approach was successful. Due to the dramatic drop in the number of flights in the commercial 
sector during the early years of the COVID-19 epidemic, the company's emphasis shifted changed from moving in 
both the commercial and government sectors to moving primarily in the government department. However, after the 
case of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, — for example, after 2021, the company will gradually resume work 
in the commercial and government sectors.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia is part of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic 
worldwide. The first positive case of COVID-19 in Indonesia was detected in March 2020, when two people were 
confirmed to have contracted it from a Japanese citizen because the government has imposed lockdown measures to 
limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This virus is extremely deadly and can cause death in humans. It also affects 
numerous activities from various industrial sectors. Because the aviation industry plays such a significant social and 
commercial role in society today, demand for air transportation is likely to rise substantially as the global economic 
expansion continues. Even though demand for air transportation is typically seen to be closely related to GDP, the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA  2016) states that passenger traffic growth has outpaced global GDP 
over the last nine years(Azka and Nurcahyo 2018). 
Indonesia is an archipelagic country with over 17,000 islands, it requires air transportation to facilitate the movement 
of products and people from one location to another. With the availability of air transportation modes that can be used 
to promote economic development, civil society, government, defense, and security, as well as corporate demands. 
According to data acquired from ATAG (Air Transport Action Group) in 2014, a country's GDP can improve by up 
to 3.5 percent as a direct or indirect result of the industry's existence (Administration 2021; Aviation 2018). 
The control of spare parts availability is essential in a variety of industries, including aviation, freight services, and 
manufacturing. Spare parts are commodities that can be exchanged and maintained in an inventory to be used to 
replace broken goods or items that need to be replaced in the future. When it comes to spare parts inventory 
management, the issue is knowing when to deliver a sufficient and efficient supply to support operating and 
maintenance activities in those industries. Generally, spare parts are quite expensive and have a large expenditure 
impact when employed as reserve stock, yet they are essential when considering high expenditures such as aircraft 
cancellations, logistic shipping delays, or power plant shutdowns. Categorizing the sorts of spare parts (SKUs) that 
can improve spare parts management decisions is one of the most critical issues in spare parts management. The 
expense of the aviation industry and customer satisfaction are two factors that managers should consider in the aviation 
sector. One of the aircraft's operational plans is the spare parts component management strategy, which plays a

5.3 Emerging Strategy Through the Change Due to Covid-19 Outbreaks 
According to the findings of direct interviews with one of the firm's directors, the company was engaged in two 
segments before COVID-19, namely commercial and government, and after COVID-19 entered Indonesia in early 
2020, the company focused only on the government sector. This is due to a reduction in commercial flights in 
Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. As conditions improve, such as the state of the COVID-19 case beginning 
to deteriorate, this company is gradually moving into the commercial and corporate sectors at the same time. 
 
6. Conclusion  
According to the findings of this study, the company developed a cost leadership strategy prior to the pandemic, and 
there was no disruption phenomenon that required the company to adjust its approach. Market demand and trends are 
the primary drivers of this strategy.  
 
PT PEAR survived the pandemic in the first year of COVID-19 in 2020, when other companies were struggling to 
live, by focusing solely on the government, and by executing this approach, the company was able to respond to the 
opportunities that presented itself. In 2021, PT Putra Elang Angkasaraya added maintenance and repair capabilities to 
Bell 429, AS 365 N Series, and Beechcraft 1900 D helicopters, demonstrating that this strategy can have a favorable 
impact on the company's business.  
 
The Indonesian government's priority shift from handling the COVID-19 pandemic to efforts to recover the economy 
in 2022, when COVID-19 cases began to decline and the country's economy began to recover, had positive 
implications for companies and the Indonesian aviation industry sector as a whole, so that the aviation MRO industry 
began to improve. As before the COVID-19 epidemic, this collection of enterprises will gradually refocus on the 
commercial and government sectors. 
 
This research adds to the existing knowledge base on developing strategies. Finally, this study's limitation is that it 
only looks at one firm in a group that works in the Indonesian aircraft MRO market. Another concern is that the 
method used only moderately interviews. As a result, more companies in the aviation MRO industry should be studied 
for future work.

Abstract 
The increasing global population drives up food demand which means crop production needs to increase. To achieve 
that, fertilizer is used. Many industries, including the fertilizer industry, are feeling the impact of COVID 19. This 
paper presents the implementation of cost leadership strategy in Indonesia fertilizer company, the effect of COVID 19 
on the fertilizer industry, and how the strategy is used to achieve competitiveness. This paper also discusses the impact 
of the implementation of cost leadership strategy to the company's financial performance. Based on the result, the five 
components of the cost leadership strategy can be fulfilled by the company. However, for the component that 
consumers have the power to bargain the price is not in accordance with the fertilizer industry. This is generally due 
to the fact that fertilizer prices in Indonesia depend on and affect world fertilizer prices. The impact of the 
implementation of the cost leadership strategy is carrying out effectiveness such as operational costs, managing 
inventory, and the use of raw materials.

Competitiveness, Cost Leadership, COVID 19, Fertilizer, Strategy 
1. Introduction
From the 1960s to 2020 the global population increased from 3.032 to 7.762 billion persons (World Bank 2022). This 
correlates with increased food demand and has resulted in the need for increased crop production. The increased crop 
production was achieved by expansion in cropland area and yield increase. The global cropland area has increased by 
4% from 2000 to 2019 while fertilizer use has increased by 34% during the period (FAO 2021). Fertilizer use 
immensely contributes to sustaining higher crop productivity and ensuring food security around the globe. Fertilizer 
prices are known to be volatile in the past years due to many reasons such as raw materials price, rising market 
competitions, and recent disruptions from COVID 19 (Ilinova  et al. 2021; Widmar 2020). 
An ongoing new virus outbreak causing pneumonia-like clusters in Wuhan city, China, has gleamed the world. The 
outbreak, confirmed on New Year’s Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then. The number has surpassed that 
of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and is 
uninterruptedly escalating (Gupta Et al 2019). Many industries, including fertilizer, are feeling the impact of COVID 
19, especially the declining production and sales. Large-scale restrictions to slow the pace of COVID-19 implemented 
by the government disrupt the company's logistics supply which affects the production and sales of products.  
Pupuk Kaltim is a company that produces urea, NPK Fertilizer, and ammonia. Urea has the largest application as a 
source of nitrogen (N) fertilizer. The total world urea requirement in the year 1970 was 32 million tons which showed 
a tremendous increasing trend up to 2015 i.e. 111.6 million tons, which is expected to be 130–150 million tons/year 
in 2050 (Rudmin et al. 2019). The application of NPK fertilizers has been the most common strategy to improve 
plants’ N, P, and K uptake efficiency and increase plant yields in many countries (Tahery et al. 2022). The global 
ammonia production reached 176 million metric tons in 2016, of which about 79% was used in the production of 
fertilizers (Fasihi et al 2021). Being associated with the food supply of a growing population, the ammonia demand 
experienced an average growth of 1.9% from 2006 to 2016 and is expected to continue this trend during the coming 
decades (Yara 2018). Of the three types of products produced by PT Pupuk Kaltim. Urea Fertilizer and ammonia are 
export products. Conditions in the year 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic had affected economic performances at 
both the global and national levels. So that every country competes to become the most competitive economy to 
survive in the era of globalization by increasing competitiveness. The concept of competitiveness can be used as a

In 2020, the inventory turnover rate was faster than the previous year, from 85 days to 57 days. Meanwhile, total asset 
turnover grew, from 61% last year to 68%. Therefore, the company makes efficiency in managing inventory, where 
the faster the inventory turnover, the more effective the product is marketed. 
 
5.4 Proposed Improvements 
During the pandemic, PT Pupuk Kaltim carried out appropriate production strategies and programs, in addition to 
carrying out a predictive maintenance excellence program which made PT Pupuk Kaltim's activities less affected by 
the pandemic. This effort must always be maintained and improved. In addition, PT Pupuk Kaltim can use an 
expansion strategy in which the strategy is used on products that have high profits and potential for greater market 
development. PT Pupuk Kaltim also has Ammonia products that allow for its derivatives such as soda ash which is a 
raw material in the manufacture of glass and detergent, so far the Indonesian government is still importing 900,000 
tons of soda ash per year from abroad such as the United States, China, and Turkey. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study aims to determine the implementation of a cost leadership strategy which is one of the generic porter 
strategies to gain a competitive advantage in the fertilizer industry. By using a case study approach to PT Pupuk Kaltim 
to represent the fertilizer industry. PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur (PKT) is one of the largest producers of urea and 
NPK fertilizers in Asia. This study uses secondary data such as the annual report and sustainability report of PT Pupuk 
Kaltim from 2016 to 2020. 
 
This study aims to determine if the cost leadership strategy is an effective strategy used in the company and to 
determine the impact of implementing cost leadership on the company's financial performance. In determining an 
effective cost leadership strategy for the company, several requirements or conditions must be met. PT. Pupuk Kaltim 
can meet five of the seven component requirements, including numbers 1 to 5 on cost leadership conditions.PT. Pupuk 
Kaltim offers a lower price compared to its competitors who provide similar products. This can have an impact on 
consumers who tend to be loyal to the company's products. In addition, fertilizer prices in Indonesia depend on world 
fertilizer prices.  
 
This study also aims to analyze company’s strategy to increase their competitiveness during COVID 19. COVID 19 
disrupted Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)’s supply chain and then causing its prices to keep increasing.  PT Pupuk 
Kaltim implemented several initiatives to increase their competitiveness, such as increasing its raw material 
consumption efficiency and lowering its operating expenses. 
 
The limitation of this research is that the data used are only the annual report and sustainability report of PT. Pupuk 
Kaltim For further research, wider data and objects can be used.

1. Introduction
Technology rapidly evolving significantly over time. In this information era, technology plays a very important 
role in various aspects of life, whether organizational, business, educational, or individual. One of the 
developments in technology and information is the Internet. With the internet, it is easier for people to access 
various information and connect in cyberspace. According to Internet World Stats data, internet users in Indonesia 
reached 212,354,070 out of a total population of 278,268,685. Unconsciously, the technology that we use every 
day can turn into a threat in itself. According to Security Intelligence, in the last 30 days there were 96,432,263 
devices in the world that experienced malware encounters, with 3,223,067 devices from Indonesia. Several 
challenges related to cyber threats require more attention to develop cyber security stronger. Cyber security 
includes practices and actions to protect network ecosystems, corporate assets, and users from malicious attacks 
aimed at compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information or data (Fischer 2009).  
Rapid changes to consumer needs and product diversity make market conditions more competitive. Every country 
in the world competes to be the most competitive economy by increasing competitiveness to survive in the era of 
globalization so that the nation's competitiveness becomes an important point for all countries in the world 
(Wibowo and Nurcahyo 2020). Responding to the many issues regarding cyber security, one of the SOEs in 
Indonesia which is engaged in inspection, testing and certification services provides solutions in the type of CSOC 
security service (Cyber Security Operations Center), cooperating with one of a Developer Company based in 
France. The service includes monitoring or managing Firewall/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), managing or 
manage Intrusion Detection System (IDSs), Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) protection, manage Unified 
Threat Management (UTM), manage Secure Messaging Gateways, manage Secure Web Gateways, Security 
Information and Event Management (SIEM), monitor Network management vulnerabilities, servers, databases or 
applications, security vulnerability or threat notification services, log management and analysis, and managed 
device-related reporting and incident response.  
This paper will discuss the analysis of cyber defense platform business feasibility using SWOT analysis, Industry 
analysis of External Factor Evaluation (EFE), and Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE). SWOT analysis is used to 
evaluate the strategy of the overall strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities of a business or organization 
(Kotler and Amstrong 2008). SWOT analysis also involves identifying internal and external factors that support 
and do not support the assessment or improvement of a business or organization  (Piton, Nurcahyo and Farizal, 
2021). The EFE matrix is used to evaluate the external aspects of the economy, social, politics, government, law 
and technology. The IFE matrix to evaluate the internal aspects of the company (David, 2011). Scores range from 
1 to 4 for each external & internal factor show how effective the company’s current strategy is in addressing these

company or industry can use Market Penetration or Product Development strategy. (3) Quadrant VI, VIII, or IX 
is harvest or divest, company or industry can use Retrenchment or Divestiture strategy (David, 2011). 
 
Based on the analysis in Table 2. Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) Matrix and Table 3 External Factor Evaluation 
(EFE) Matrix, Table 4 below shows the score of each factor of the SWOT Analysis.

advantage of existing opportunities. The strategy that must be set in this condition is to support a growth oriented 
strategy policy. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the calculation of the IFE Matrix and EFE Matrix values, the conclusion of the analysis is that the IFE 
Matrix value is 2.35 and EFE Matrix value is 2.15, so when mapped to the Internal and External Matrix, quadrant

Abstract 
Nowadays, companies’ first target is to build an intelligent, flexible, integrated and efficient processes, for higher 
industrial performance. According to this, a new concept emerged within the industrial firms by the name of Industry 
4.0 (I4.0). This 4th industrial revolution covers four main aspects: intelligent factory, real-time communication, smart 
products and more satisfied customers. As strong as are the new technologies offered by this revolution, it is not 
entirely sufficient if not combined with lean principles. Combining these two paradigms created what is known today 
as Lean 4.0, a new concept presenting several opportunities for higher performance. Nevertheless, this combination 
is far from being as simple as it seems. A deep and structured risk analysis is required to ensure a smooth 
implementation of lean 4.0 system within a company. The purpose of this paper is to discuss I4.0, lean manufacturing 
and Lean 4.0 risks and opportunities through a systematic literature review, and to study the different barriers to its 
implementation through the modelling of a case study using sequence diagram and SWOT analysis. Its contribution 
consists of being a reflection paper to the companies aiming to develop their digital maturity by exploiting Lean 4.0 
tools.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 is a concept that represents a whole new vision of the factory where products and machines become 
intelligent and are part of a network based on heterogeneous integration of data and knowledge. As one of the most 
high-tech manufacturing countries, Germany holds many of the most sophisticated manufacturing companies and 
factories (MacDuffie 1995), which allowed the German government to introduce new technologies aiming to support 
1018","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

company’s digital maturity, quality, productivity and performance, but also to create new business models and 
customized products and services to cope with customer demand fluctuation. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the research held in the context of this paper, we can state that Lean Production is a people and organization-
oriented approach, while I4.0 is a technology-oriented one enabling a fluid information and material flows along the 
value chain. But the target remains the same: less costs with higher performance. Researchers studying the integration 
of these two paradigms has found many complementarities, and stated that, on one hand, continuous improvement 
practices establishment and LM practices preliminary implementation in the company makes I4.0 technologies 
adoption more accessible, and on the other hand, I4.0 technologies enhance Lean manufacturing efficiency. Indeed, 
the case study proposed is a consistent example of Lean 4.0 application.  
 
This study can serve as a support to companies willing to implement Lean 4.0 concept. Eventually, results of the 
SWOT analysis have shown several treats to Lean 4.0 adoption such as cyber-security, social awareness, lack of 
financial support and lack of skills, but many opportunities as well. We are now talking about autonomous and 
flexible systems enabling the customization of products and services for higher competitiveness within the industrial 
firms and higher customer satisfaction due to quality increase and lead time decrease.   
 
In terms of perspectives, government and private sectors collaboration within the education sector is primordial. More 
programs and funds regarding Industry 4.0 technologies are highly needed to instore innovation culture within our 
society and encourage employers to engage more in the development of Industry 4.0. On the other hand, due to the 
lack of Lean 4.0 risk and opportunities studies, the analysis was based on authors’ personal knowledge and experience. 
In response to this, the next step is to prepare a survey in order to evaluate the barriers faced by companies while 
implementing lean 4.0, or the treats that stopped them from adopting this new concept. Finally, research must be held 
to study the possibility to overcome the weaknesses and threats identified during our analysis.

Abstract 
Revolution in medical imaging systems generate high-resolution images. This revolution has created new challenges 
in accessing, sharing, archiving, and protecting medical images. The number of these images has also increased 
significantly over the past decade, which is create another challenge. Recently, the health care industry has started 
noticing cloud computing as a solution because of its elasticity and scalability, which contribute to avoiding hardware 
obsolescence, providing universal access to medical images anywhere and anytime, and increasing their availability. 
This paper introduces the main characteristics of the cloud-based picture archiving and communication system (PACS) 
and highlights its technical and nontechnical advantages. Moreover, this paper illustrates challenges in cloud-based 
medical image exchange, regulation, and interoperability as well as how medical image existence can affect cloud 
users. Furthermore, the paper concludes with directions for future research in medical imaging.

1. Introduction
Over the past decade, most health care providers have transitioned from film-based image management systems to those 
that are fully digital (filmless and paperless) (Yang et al. 2010). However, the benefit of this shift is limited to conversion 
from paper to digital image. With the advance technology in digital image, picture archiving and communication systems 
(PACSs) (Stephens  2021) (Erickson & Kitamura  2021) have been introduced as highly redundant archives that integrate 
with radiology information systems to increase productivity in radiology and medicine. Today, a PACS is one of most 
valuable tools facilitating medical decisions and treatment procedures. PACSs enable the storage and retrieval of 
medical images as well as their distribution among health care professionals. 
Cloud computing is a trending approach that facilitates sharing files over the Internet. Cloud computing allows access 
to applications and data without any infrastructure inside the medical organization. However, despite cloud computing’s 
opportunities, it also features some unique challenges that must be carefully addressed. This paper is a survey paper that 
highlights current efforts in developing cloud-based PACSs and the challenges of this research. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of work related to cloud-based applications in health 
care and some cloud-based PACSs. In Section 3, we overview three medical terms associated with medical imaging: 
PACSs, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), and Health Level Seven (HL7). The latter two 
terms represent well-known health standards. Section 4 evaluates cloud-based PACS and illustrates the process of and 
reasons behind the development of cloud computing’s interaction with medical imaging. Section 5 presents current 
challenges in cloud-based PACS research. Section 6 concludes the paper. 
2. Related Work
The health care industry is challenged by significant pressures to decrease the costs associated with providing health
care services, adopt new electronic health care systems, and communicate data with other health care professionals and
government agencies quickly and securely. Traditionally, the health care industry been slow to accept new technologies
for reasons related to infrastructure supporting back-office operations. Many hospitals and medical care organizations
keep their servers and desktops two to three years longer than the average for non-health care organizations (Alley  et
al. 2012).
Despite the challenges of cloud computing, the health care industry has started considering cloud computing as a
solution. In some specific areas, the industry can use cloud computing solutions to enhance its operations and provide
better, more cost-effective patient care.

(Microsoft – Cloud, Computers, Apps & Gaming, n.d.), Google (Google - About Google, Our Culture & Company News, 
n.d.), and Amazon (About Amazon, n.d.)) have made commitments to use suitable policies and practices to secure 
customers’ data and privacy. These security techniques include encrypting medical images before sending them to the 
cloud or ensuring they can be accessed only with a password. 
 
Access Control 
Misuse of cloud authority by cyber criminals is the core threat to cloud contents’ security. For instance, cloud providers 
allow any user with a valid credit card to register and use cloud services. 
The suggested solution is outsourcing access control to ensure that the access control structures are not disclosed to the 
cloud provider while still allowing remote sites to use this information to verify access rights and help in applying access 
privileges. 
 
Data ownership 
Ownership defines as an owner or a creator of information or even an information owner who is the person that responsible 
for the information. The embedding of an ownership seal in an image is achieved using watermarking and encryption 
techniques. 
 
Zero tolerance 
Because of the encryption or watermarking used with medical images, a spot may appear in a medical image retrieved 
from a cloud. Thus, a doctor may give a faulty diagnosis. To prevent this problem, watermarking must be performed 
carefully. 
 
Bandwidth Challenge 
Medical imaging files are measured in terabytes. A busy radiologist may get tired of a slow connection. One article 
(Khajeh-Hosseini et al.  2010) reveals that health care organizations facing bandwidth-related challenges lack sufficiently 
high-bandwidth connections to the Internet or require external service providers to achieve appropriate levels of 
performance. 
 
Regulation and Compliance Requirements 
Cloud-based PACSs should be compliant with the policies of health care authorities and practices (Koch  2012). For 
instance, HIPAA and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act require that health data be 
processed in certain prescribed ways. Moreover, the regulations of the countries in which cloud computing organizations 
host their servers and other regulations related to personal data must be taken into account.  
 
Medical Data Interoperability 
Data interoperability is defined as the capacity for communication and exchange of data between two or more systems, 
which can lower the costs and encourage the sharing of information among patients and providers. Data interoperability 
requires loading, storing and transferring data in distinctive organizations and sites. The obvious solution is to find out a 
standardized interface [1]. This issue has the priority of the health IT market, vendors, government agencies such as the 
Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health IT (ONC | Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information 
Technology, n.d.), and cloud health care providers. 
 
Integration into On-Premise IT 
The integration issue has the priority of the health IT market, vendors, and government agencies such as the ONC.  
 
Vendor-Neutral Archive 
A vendor-neutral (VN) archive enables hospitals to send images to the cloud from any PACS and access these images 
from any PACS. For instance, a hospital can send images to the cloud from PACS A to be viewed by another hospital 
from PACS B. Vendor-neutral can be achieved by supporting health care standards such as DICOM and HL7 while 
integrating with other software and by storing images in non-proprietary DICOM formats across all DICOM SOP classes 
(Mather et al.  2009). 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
Medical imaging and cloud computing are coming across to find new opportunities to assist physicians and clinicians in

making better decisions. The health care domain has started placing more trust in cloud computing despite its current 
challenges. This paper discussed cloud-based medical imaging mechanisms and analysed the various challenges 
associated with this approach. It examined the current solutions and discussed their limitations. Finally, it discussed 
directions for future research.

Abstract 
This paper aims to explore the main challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry today, as well as the potential 
opportunities offered by emerging Industry 4.0 technologies that can help address these challenges. To this end, a 
systematic literature review (SLR) based on a search with the keywords “Pharma” and “Industry 4.0” for 
identification, selection, and evaluation of the published research in this area, was performed. Thus, following this 
approach, two main questions were attempted to be answered: (i) “What is the As-Is situation that characterize the 
today’s pharmaceutical production”; and, (ii) “How technological perspective presents itself as a possible To-Be 
situation by the use of I4.0 concepts”. The key contribution of this research lays in the exploration of different obstacles 
in the current way how pharma is operating and what concepts from Industry 4.0 are in place to overcome them. The 
conclusion shows that the special situation in pharma due to its strong regulation by external authorities needs special 
ways of process design.

1. Introduction
Today's pharmaceutical production facilities mostly allow one type of drug, active ingredient or dosage to be processed 
on one production line at a time (Sarkis et al., 2021). New technology makes it feasible from a technical perspective
to change that in the coming years. Traditional approaches become challenged, practices and business models for the
manufacture of pharmaceuticals change by new possibilities and ways of thinking (Arden et al., 2021; Reinhardt et al.
2020).

Abstract 
Aviation is one of the modes of transportation that is relied on by the Indonesian until now. Currently, various parties 
are starting to focus on improving the quality and service of air transportation supporting infrastructure, both local and 
international flights. In the midst of the uncertainty of transportation conditions in Indonesia, aviation has had a 
considerable impact. One of them is service at the airport. Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II, are state owned 
enterprise companies which are engaged in airport management in Indonesia. This paper will focus on comparing the 
strategy effectiveness of both companies before and during pandemic situations using each company perspective. By 
comparing both revenue trends and cost revenue ratio from 2019 and 2020, it can be concluded that neither company’s 
strategies are effectively implemented during the pandemic. 
Keywords 
Strategy Effectiveness, David’s Alternative Strategy, Aviation Industry, Airport Service Company, COVID-19. 
1. Introduction
Since the first quarter of 2020, the world has experienced changes due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which originally started in China and spread throughout the world 
(WHO). Due to the massive spread of the disease and its fatality rate, WHO has declared this outbreak as a pandemic 
in March 2020 (McCarthy  2020). Therefore, countries started to implement preventive actions to limit the deadly 
outbreak, including Indonesia. One of the early steps Indonesia took is to tighten supervision of entry routes to 
Indonesia, including airport, ports, and land border crossings (Gitiyarko  2020). Thus, causing a huge business impact 
on the related sectors, such as the aviation industry. 
On managing Indonesia’s airport, the government has chosen a couple of airport services organizations to manage its 
hundreds of airports scattered throughout the archipelago. Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II are two state owned 
enterprise companies which manage different areas of airports in Indonesia. Angkasa Pura I is responsible for operating 
airports in eastern Indonesia, while Angkasa Pura II mainly operates in western Indonesia (Aksara  2021). 
In an uncertain event like the pandemic, companies surely have to review its existing strategy to ensure that the 
company’s operational and business performance are still as effective as its hoped. According to Nurcahyo et al. 
(2021), the company's operational performance and business performance are very important in increasing the global 
competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is closely related to competitiveness (Bredrup  1995) which is defined 
as the ability of a sector, industry, or company to compete successfully to achieve sustainable growth in a global 
environment as long as the balance cost is lower than the revenue from the resources used (Wibowo and Nurcahyo, 
2020). Based on the study of Nurcahyo, Wibowo, Robasa & Cahyati (2019), capability in production, operations and 
functions carry extensive influence in strategic manufacturing planning which helps companies achieve their goals.  
Strategy itself is the development of activities which require a broad selection of tasks and aims to make a profit 
(Porter, 1996). According to David (2011), there are 11 types of alternative strategies a company may implement, 
which are forward integration, backward integration, horizontal integration, market penetration, market development,

5.1.2 Implementation of Angkasa Pura II Strategy  
Angkasa Pura II mentions their initiatives strategy based on David’s Alternatives strategy and it is shown in Table 7.  
They focus mainly on market penetration, development, services, and diversification, to sustain both before and during 
the pandemic.

Type of Strategy 
Policy Implementation in 2019 and 2020 
Market Penetration 
Develop core business by managing other airports both through assignment of shareholders 
and through company initiatives supported by adequate business studies.

Development 
Utilization of resources owned by companies located outside the airport working area as a 
business portfolio that provides added value for the Company. 
Service 
Development 
Development of new services with technology related to serving the current market, by 
developing bonded zone terminals, developing integrated offices, developing Check-in 
Lounges/CIP Lounges, e-kiosks, e-payments, e-commerce, and commercialization of ICT. 
Diversification 
Partnership with world-class airport managers and Cargo Managers in an effort to open 
opportunities to improve performance and accelerate the Company’s business growth. 
 
5.2 Strategy Effectiveness 
Based on both companies' identification of strategies implementation, Angkasa Pura I indicates a more adaptive 
strategy approach to face the pandemic condition than Angkasa Pura II. Angkasa Pura I’s rebound strategy focuses 
more on how the company can sustain and adapt to the new normal. They mainly focus on unrelated diversification 
and retrenchment strategies to survive in the condition of uncertainty. Whereas Angkasa Pura II implements the same 
strategy before and after the pandemic, which are market penetration, market development, service (product) 
development, and diversification. 
 
By considering both company’s revenue trend and cost revenue ratio, it can be concluded that neither Angkasa Pura I 
and Angkasa Pura II strategy is effectively implemented to sustain its business. Both company’s revenue indicate a 
sharp decline of 58% for Angkasa Pura I and 47% for Angkasa Pura II. Even though they successfully decreased their 
cost by 10% for Angkasa Pura I and 17% for Angkasa Pura II, their cost revenue ratio still experienced an increase of 
almost double from the previous year. Angkasa Pura I experienced an increased cost revenue ratio from 68% to 147%, 
whereas Angkasa Pura II shifted from 78% to 123%. 
 
6. Conclusion 
COVID-19 has greatly affected the world of aviation in Indonesia, especially airport operators, which are shown from 
the evidence of declined revenue in the period from 2019 to 2020. Angkasa Pura I & Angkasa Pura II try to strengthen 
their preparation for the new policy of COVID-19 situations handling that can affect their operational services. From 
the data obtained, we found that Angkasa Pura I declined revenue and service has a lower number compared to 
Angkasa Pura II, which is caused by the operation area of Angkasa Pura II being larger than Angkasa Pura I. 
 
To survive the uncertainty condition, both companies implement their initiatives such as Rebound Strategy 
implemented by Angkasa Pura I that consist of 5 step strategies from preparation about new normal behaviour, 
strengthening business portfolio, improvement of business process, organizational restructuring, and remapping 
business architecture that will adapt with current situation. On the other hand, Angkasa Pura II has implemented 
David's Alternative Strategy in 2019 and 2020 based on market penetration, market development, service 
development, and diversification. 
 
Based on both initiative strategies we can conclude that both companies agree to strengthen the preparation about new 
behaviour of market and user, strengthen the company’s assets and services, along with looking for new opportunities

of revenue stream to sustain uncertain conditions. Based on the strategy effectiveness of both companies by comparing 
its revenue and cost revenue ratio, it can be concluded that neither company has an effective strategy to face the 
pandemic condition. 
This paper has several limitations, which is only focusing on financial aspects such as annual revenue and financial 
ratios. Furthermore, this paper emphasizes the empirical study about the aviation sector in Indonesia. The future 
research may consider additional information such as government regulations.

Abstract 
Human Resource (HR) technologies, despite being developed rapidly in recent years, has not been fully utilized in 
developing countries. Although many large companies are migrating into second generation technologies which 
include cloud-based solutions, medium and small sized companies are still are the stage of digitalizing their HR 
activities which include gamification. Gamification refers to the use of game machine and game to improve 
employees’ engagement in areas of skills development, recruitment, and employee training. However, the use of 
gamification in HR activities among manufacturing companies has not been examined and their readiness is not 
accurately gauged.  Therefore, this study aimed to descriptively explore the current use of gamification in HR activities 
and selected manufacturing companies’ readiness to adopt gamification in HR activities. A total of thirty-two 
manufacturing companies participated upon selection of sample using purposive sampling.  Technology Readiness 
Index (TRI) by Parasuranam (2000) was used to measure companies’ readiness to embrace gamification in their HR 
activities. Although majority of companies (56.3%) has never heard about gamification, 68.7% have the intention to 
implement gamification in their HR activities. It is found that the less the number of employees a company has, the 
less incline they are in the use of gamification. In terms of technology readiness, Insecurity has the highest mean of 
3.63 followed by Optimism (M=3.54), Discomfort (M=3.38) and Innovativeness (M=3.26). Overall technology 
readiness index is 3.45 which is moderate. This finding contributes to our existing understanding on the extent of 
manufacturing companies’ readiness to use gamification in their HR activities.

Abstract 
Retail experience has shifted from traditional shopping to online shopping, making it convenient to the 
consumers. This convenience is an outcome of various in-built modules, which aims to enrich the shopping 
experience to the next level. The technological advancements have added newer variables to pre existing 
retail process. The challenge before marketers is to include, integrate and align these newer variables into 
existing system. The effective integration of these modules to the core framework will define the success 
of the retail process.This paper is an attempt to develop concept with suggestive framework to integrate at 
various levels of e-retail through technology. The suggestive frame work also aims to figure the existing as 
well as newer concerns related to e-retailing process.

Abstract 
Patents are documents about inventions that provide legal protection from which we can learn about technological 
development. Firms hold the monopoly of producing the relevant technology for a certain period of time, and in order 
to protect their technological superiority, they prepare the invention notification forms and complete their official 
applications to the patent office. The number of patents is a strong indicator of the R&D activities of a firm, country 
or region. For this reason, it is possible to write a large number of scientific articles that specifically analyze a 
technology or a region. Thus, what does society think of these official monopoly documents? One of the ways to find 
out what the society thinks about a subject is to follow the flow on the social media channel twitter. This study presents 
a partial analysis of what the public is talking about on twitter about patents. The tweets written in English, collected 
for a total of 2 months (106415 tweets), are subjected to a content analysis. When the hashtags of the tweets were 
examined, it was determined that the patents of some technologies (VR, crypto, blockchain, vaccine) were much 
trendy. In addition, sentiment analysis of tweet contents was also performed. It has been determined that while the 
emotional state is neutral in tweets about crypto patents, the average emotional intensity of tweets about vaccines is 
negative. In addition, it has been revealed through analyzes that these results differ according to countries and gender.

1. Introduction
Today, due to the widespread use of the internet, many people express their opinions through social media services. 
Social media platforms such as Twitter, which are also available to ordinary members of the public, can provide unique 
information about public reactions to certain events and changes in their minds over time. It has been widely 
recognized that Twitter is a strong indicator of public awareness on a range of current social and medical issues 
(Crannell et al. 2016). Increases or decreases in tweet volume can also indicate which event is getting the most 
attention.  
On the other hand, patents are documents that provide legal protection for the protection of the production right of 
technological innovations. It is common for patents to be analyzed to gain insight into the direction of technological 
development (Durmuşoğlu 2017; Durmusoglu and Unutmaz Durmusoglu 2021). However, it is noteworthy that no 
study has been conducted to understand what patents mean as technical documents for a non-technical audience. 
Technology can have positive and negative connotations for societies, as well as the perception of patents, which are 
official registrations of technologies, can be classified as positive or negative. How much has patents/technologies 
been a matter in Twitter, a channel of daily communication, and what emotional load do these tweets have? This study 
collects tweets about the patents in English within a certain date range and aims to analyze the key topics and the 
emotional load in the content of the tweets. Twitter's retrospective listing of tweets containing search terms for no 
more than one week required the query to be repeated daily. As part of the data collection process, all tweets that

(VR) and augmented reality (AR) and digital objects (Mystakidis 2022). On the other hand, tweets about Moderna are 
clearly much more associated with negative emotions.

When the patent-themed Tweets discussed in this study are analyzed according to users, it is understood that the person 
who tweets the most is Elon MUSK with 382 tweets. In second place, an American politician and activist named 
Bernard Sanders with 177 Tweets. 
4. Conclusion
Patents are official documents that provide information about the direction and pace of technological development. 
Although the analysis of these documents is frequently encountered in the literature, the issue of how these documents 
is perceived by the public has not yet been addressed. This study can be seen as the first demonstration of an initial 
effort in this regard. The study is based on the analysis of tweets that the society commonly prefers to communicate. 
The study showed that patents are topics that attract the attention of the public, but in particular, patents for some 
technologies seem to be more popular than others. Cryptosystems have often been the subject of tweets about patents. 
The sentimental charge of these tweets is generally positive. Similarly, vaccine patents were also frequently discussed 
in tweets. However, the sentimental load in vaccine patents is not as positive as in crypto systems. It essential to state 
that this research was conducted with limited data. It is not possible to generalize the results as it is not possible to 
represent the entire population. It is possible to improve this work with a deeper analysis and a more comprehensive 
data set.

Abstract 
In the business world, it is known that there is an increasing demand for basic/soft skills that are outside the profession 
and job-specific skills, but are required for all professions. Among these soft skills, the most known and demanded 
social skills are: professional attitude, problem solving, critical thinking, business ethics, public speaking, professional 
writing, teamwork, digital literacy, leadership, and suitability for multicultural work environments. What the concept 
of soft skill should express precisely is one's ability to master controllable actions in certain subjects. The ambiguity 
of the definition of the concept also makes it difficult to use data-based methods to measure soft skills. There are 
studies in the scientific literature that see soft skills as a synergy of multiple competencies that can be acquired through 
experience and knowledge. This paper analyzed 718 academic job postings using the SkillNER software used to 
automatically extract soft skills from text and sought to identify social skills sought in academics. It was determined 
that there were 555 soft skills requests in 718 job postings. The most requested soft skills in these job postings were 
communication, leadership and suitability for teamwork, respectively.

1.Introduction
The skills required in the employment are categorized as “soft” skills (related to interpersonal communication) and 
“hard” skills (related to technical abilities) (Lyu and Liu 2021). In recent years, business world and academia has 
shown an increasing interest in soft skills (Azim et al. 2010; Taylor 2016). Soft skills have been essential and critical 
in obtaining a position in the industry. The reason for this is that in order to work in a workplace, a person must have 
some qualifications beyond all technical knowledge (which is possible to correct the deficiencies in a relatively short 
time). For example, qualities such as the individual's ability to act in accordance with the environment in which he/she 
will work, to communicate, to work as a member of a team, to give confidence and to understand the cultural norms 
of the workplace. Even in very a technical field like engineering, being a good leader has been a non-technical (soft) 
skill that will be requested in many of the workplaces (Kumar and Hsiao 2007).  
Although soft skills can be learned/taught, the findings show that even engineering seniors do not know about soft 
skills or ways to apply these soft skills through conflict resolution (Burrows and Borowczak 2017). One of the reasons 
why these skills, which can become a part of the education curriculum, have not yet been fully included in the 
education systems, perhaps is that there has not been a consensus on the definition of the concept yet. Each discipline, 
industrial sector and market or country may define soft skills by considering its own needs. For example, (Deming

In the third place, there is the skill of “working in a team” or “being a part of the team”. A team may be viewed as a 
group of people who work together to attain the same objectives and goals in order to deliver high-quality activities. 
For all participants, multidisciplinary research teams that comprise academics, students, and volunteers may be hard 
and rewarding (Hall et al. 2005). Collaboration of professionals begins when they discover shared interests or when 
one develops problems that appear to require the assistance of others in universities and other organizations (Hagstrom 
1964). Without a proper coordination scenario, group effort may actually constrain the process of creative thinking 
and analytical improvement due to inefficient interaction among group members (Bush and Hattery 1956). In addition, 
it can be difficult to foster significant collaboration and teamwork within a system that prioritizes individual faculty, 
especially when circumstances favor a tendency to act alone. On the other hand, aptitude for teamwork is an important 
soft skill for successful research teams in academia. Another issue is that faculty members guide the development of 
teamwork skills of undergraduate students as part of educational activities. College grads' ability to work in teams is 
becoming increasingly crucial. 
 
As a result, college teachers must give opportunities for students to exercise collaboration (Burbach et al. 2010). 
Although it is possible to see papers on teaching teamwork in the class environment, it is noteworthy that there is no 
satisfactory study on teamwork among faculty members in the scientific literature. 
 
Following the three most demanded soft skills (communication, leadership and suitability for teamwork), other 
remarkable soft skills has been “planning” and “responsibility” respectively. Educator are mostly agree that planning 
is an important part of teaching (Morine 1973). Planning is a soft skill that can be needed in many different ways 
depending on the content (such as planning course contents, planning the curriculum, planning the future of a 
program/department/faculty, planning research, planning responsibilities and authorities within the team). From the 
perspective of teaching, each course, as well as entire programs, should be planned with coherence and integrity in 
mind (Stark et al. 1988). On the other hand, research planning should include at least four separate steps: focus on 
knowledge production; determine the research topic; reviewing previous research on the subject; and finally creating 
relevant scenarios to develop your own approach. The request for the ""responsibility"" soft skill in faculty postings can 
be evaluated in a similar context to those in other professions. Faculty members have important professional and 
ethical responsibilities towards their community, institution, faculty, department, students, and research teams they 
work for. As a researcher, a faculty member is responsible to produce and disseminate knowledge in both the 
classroom and world at large (Cyprès 2014). The goals of the individual institutions where they work, as well as the 
government, influence an academic's responsibilities (Sidek et al. 2012). 
 
 
4.Conclusions 
With the increasing competition, it is getting harder to work as a lecturer at universities. In addition to knowledge-
based technical indicators (graduation school, published articles, number of citations received, etc.), it is revealed in 
this study that some personal soft skills are also expected from candidates. In this study, academic job postings were 
examined in terms of soft skills demands for a limited time. Key features sought were communication skills, leadership 
and suitability for teamwork. Although this study does not make any claims about the difference of the mentioned 
skills from other professional business areas, it can be stated that these social skills are valuable skills for all 
professions. Conditions within professors are not static, and to meet the educational demands of the global 
organization of the twenty-first century, individuals must strive towards professional development and training to 
continually update their skills. It is of course inevitable that the soft qualifications expected from graduates are 
expected from the faculty members who train them.

Abstract 
The amount of created and captured data has been increasing rapidly. Since 2018, the amount of data generated and 
collected surpasses 90% of the data produced in the previous years. To meet the 2030 United Nations Economic 
Commission for Europe (UNECE) statistical agenda, National Statistics Organizations (NSOs) must meet the required 
amount of data demanded through the modernization of statistics. Relevant studies showed the implementation of 
official statistics with lean six sigma, resulting in a 5% operational budget reduction. Moreover, integrating official 
statistics with big data analytics produced more efficient and timelier statistics. However, in this industry 4.0 era, there 
is a lack of practices in the integration of big data tools and technique with the official statistics. The reason might be 
the uncertainty on the challenges and potential solutions. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews and analyses 
the critical challenges and potential solutions for the integration of big data analytics and lean six sigma into the 
processes of generating official statistics. A comprehensive and systematic literature review was conducted. Findings 
showed that the challenges of integrating big data are lack of proper infrastructure, data quality and data privacy. On 
the other hand, challenges of integrating lean six sigma are lack of management support, lack of common goal and the 
hierarchical organization structure. This paper will contribute to future work by using the identified challenges of 
integrating official statistics with big data analytics and lean six sigma to develop and propose a framework which 
overcomes the critical challenges and maximize the benefits.

analytics; one of the issues that individuals face is utilizing their personal information and data commercially without 
their permission (Ogbuke et al. 2022). According to the current literature, the challenges in performing big data 
analytics are associated with security issues, privacy issues, ethical issues, lack of laws and regulations for preserving 
individual information, and inadequate infrastructure and IT infrastructure. Based on the above discussion, the 
following challenges must be addressed and resolved. 
 
Lack of infrastructure is a significant challenge while implementing big data with official statistics. Using large 
datasets requires an advanced infrastructure with proper data processing, data warehouse, and data analysis 
technologies. National Statistics Organizations must invest in providing the right technologies and infrastructure to 
improve statistical processes and outputs. Also, data quality is considered a critical challenge to address due to the 
dependency of machine learning algorithms on big data sources. Failure to meet the data quality requirements can 
lead to unsatisfied results, which will affect the organization's reputation. A monitoring and fixing system should be 
implemented continuously to overcome this issue. Moreover, data privacy is another main challenge for applying big 
data in official statistics, even though privacy is vital for National statistics Organizations. Obtaining data without the 
consent of the users can result in potential legal threads. While implementing big data analytics with official statistics, 
transparency, obtaining consent, information security, accountability, and preserving individuals' rights should be 
considered. In addition to that, publishing laws for protecting the user's personal information should be considered. 
 
Research challenge category #2  
Incorporating Lean Six Sigma in official statistics 
According to McSweeney and Moore (2015), implanting lean six sigma with official statistics in National Statistics 
Organizations entails some challenges. A hierarchy organization structure is a significant challenge for integrating 
lean six sigma with official statistics, which can be a blockage for applying changes. National Statistics Organizations 
must adopt a more flexible organizational structure to enhance communication, reduce waste, and eliminate non-added 
value activities. Lack of management support is a critical challenge that must be addressed by engaging leaders with 
the employees, encouraging changes in culture, and enforcing leadership support. Also, the lack of a common goal is 
a challenge that can lead to difficulties in adopting changes and losing the focus to improve the performance. National 
Statistical Organizations must identify an apparent purpose by focusing on the customers' needs and committing to 
achieving it.  
 
5. Conclusion and Future Work 
While facilitating the daily life activities and business processes, fast growing technology brings some challenges with 
itself. As it is very well-known, big data analytics can be utilized in many aspects now, including the official statistics 
processes. The benefits of using big data tools and lean six sigma are obvious in the literature, however, there is very 
limited research about a comprehensive list of the challenges. This paper identified these challenges by a systematic 
literature review technique.  It appeared that the most critical challenges for integrating big data analytics with official 
statistics are lack of proper infrastructure, data quality, and data privacy. The most critical challenges for integrating 
official statistics with lean six sigma are the hierarchical organization structure, lack of management support, and lack 
of common goal. These findings show that the organizations need a systematic process to generate official statistics 
by using the advanced technological methods. Therefore, as a future work, it is suggested to develop a framework 
which may help organizations integrate the big data analytics and lean six sigma into the process of generating official 
statistics. This framework may also support organizations in overcoming the stated challenges in this paper and 
maximize the benefits to produce more efficient and timely statistics.

Abstract 
This article discusses the efforts of the UNIQLO fashion brand in reducing waste materials as the implementation of 
the Sustainable Development Goals. UNIQLO implements a sustainability campaign through its recycling project. 
This article describes how UNIQLO uses waste materials as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals using the Corporate Shared Value theory. In this case, it is promoting a recycling program that also provides 
shared value by selling sustainable products. This article uses a qualitative method, by collecting sources through 
journals, news, websites, and related articles.

Introduction 
In the last decade, we can see an increase in textile waste. One of the factors is due to economic developments which 
resulted in the emergence of clothing sales (Nguy et al.  2021). By selling clothes in large quantities at low prices, fast 
fashion emerged as the dominant business model, causing garment consumption to skyrocket (Bick et al.  2018). 
Where, globally, about 56 million tons of clothing are purchased every year, and it is estimated that this will increase 
to 93 million tons in 2030 and 160 million tons in 2050 (BBC  2020). The thing that most people never consider and 
lack awareness of is that the impact of clothing on the environment is enormous. This can be proven by an estimated 
92 million tonnes of textile waste globally every year and the equivalent of a garbage truck ending up in a landfill 
every second (BBC  2020).  
Examine the environmental impact of reusing clothing from the reuse perspective and discover that reselling second-
hand clothes may minimize the purchase of new garments, and reusing clothes can lessen the environmental impact. 
(Valverde et al. 2012) investigate textile waste management and propose reusing leftover textile fibers for heat 
insulation panels that may be used in the building industry. A review of second-hand clothes reuse reveals that reuse 
on a local level dominates, but online interchange will spread second-hand clothing reuse beyond regional boundaries. 
Investigate the carbon footprint of second-hand clothes reuse and create a ""integrated solid waste management system"" 
that incorporates relevant reuse enterprises, online exchange platforms, and traditional waste management channels. 
(Fortuna and Diyamandoglu 2017). 
The need for sustainability in the general fashion sector is expanding due to the connection to the environment 
throughout the production stage, garment waste issues in rapid fashion, consumer desire for eco-friendly products, 
and company attitude changes. The importance of charting a course for the future of the fashion business is being 
underlined. Fast fashion brands must ensure that they grasp the consumer brand association network structure in terms 
of sustainable fashion because they are working on numerous sustainable fashions and marketing activities. Despite 
this, few studies have discovered brand connections for fast fashion brands committed to sustainability. (Camiciottoli 
et al.  2014)

This research is very useful to encourage further research. Especially in the development of production methods that 
prioritize values such as those contained in the SDGs. Especially research that uses CSV theory. so from this it is 
hoped that it can help reduce the use of materials and also the excessive production caused by the fast fashion industry.

Abstract 
Many companies facing digitalisation lack a digital target model or transformation/implementation roadmap. 
Multinational companies as well as SMEs have to deal with different global market trends. Besides volatility, 
uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity [VUCA], companies' business models are constantly being influenced by 
disruptive technologies and solutions. And all this comes along with Industry 4.0 and digitalisation itself. Yet I4.0 and 
digitalisation are in many companies still buzzwords and lack substance. Assuming that the level of digitalisation of 
an enterprise has been defined, the main question is: ""What does the digitalisation journey look like, and what are the 
transformation roadmap and the interdependencies?"" This paper investigates whether, when and which of the 
independencies of company's functions are being neglected in the implementation of digitalisation. In a systematic 
literature review, gaps were identified especially in three previously defined categories that are directly related to the 
implementation of digitalisation, namely corporate culture, leadership and technology. After identification of these 
gaps, the missing link between these categories was discussed. In this way, the gaps revealed in the literature could be 
filled. The further scientific elaboration will primarily serve as a guide for SMEs to ensure a smooth implementation 
of digitalisation in the company.

Abstract 
Medical certificate cause of death (MCCD) data is an important source of information for public health monitoring, 
priority setting, and planning. The completeness and accuracy of data on the cause of death affect the value of the 
policies adopted. Poor-quality data can lead to missed opportunities to improve the health of the population. This study 
aims to obtain a strategy to improve the quality of data on MCCD. We used DKI Jakarta province mortality 
surveillance data, which was collected from health facilities. The death cases from 2016 to 2019 and the deceased who 
lived in the DKI Jakarta area were selected. The Analysis of National Causes of Death for Action (ANACONDA) 
software  5.0  was used to determine the quality of the  MCCD data 
Results: The number of Health Facilities sending data from 2016 to 2019 has increased. Annual percentages Garbage 
Code (GC) tend not to change (more than 50%). GC in categories 3, 5, and 1 tend to be stable with an annual average 
of 34%, 26%, and 21%. Meanwhile, Category 4 tends to increase though it is small (from 5.7 to 14.4%). Based on the 
potential impact that GC causes in guiding or misguiding public policy to prevent, more than 60% is identified as 
being in the very high-level category. 
Conclusion: Identifying the accuracy of cause of death data was needed to make the right strategy for improving the 
quality of data.

1. Introduction
Cause-specific mortality data is important to monitoring progress towards national and international health goals, 
including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 17  SDGs indicators, require cause-specific mortality data from 
a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system for their measurement (Rao et al. 2005; AbouZahr 2011; 
Bauni et al. 2011; Murray et al. 2011; Sartorius  2013; Miki et al. 2018; Adair et al. 2021).  All countries are committed 
to SDG, However, not all countries including Indonesia have a good CRVS system. The availability of mortality data 
at the national level is obtained through surveys (NIHRD 2015; Indriasih  2017). Meanwhile, since 1999 based on 
Indonesian law, Indonesia has begun to implement a decentralized system. Districts or provinces have the autonomy 
to manage and regulate the government, so data needs at the regional level are indispensable for planning, monitoring, 
and evaluating their programs. Until now, there has been no publication regarding the availability of routine data on 
causes of death at the provincial or district/city level in Indonesia. There is little information on mortality data, perhaps 
only DKI Jakarta Province has mortality surveillance.  
DKI Jakarta Province has a population of about 10.5 million people, the Crude Death Rate (CDR) is 4.9 per 1000, so 
it is estimated that every year it will record around 52,100 deaths spread across 6 districts (BPS (Statistics Indonesia),

6. Conclusion  
DKI Jakarta MCCD data has poor quality and there is no significant change for 4 years. More than half of the 
MCCD data were identified as garbage codes and most of them were categorized as having serious impacts on 
public policy. The GC by age group also describes a serious problem. To avoid prolonged problems, in the future 
must have a better strategy. Evaluation of data quality needs to be done regularly, coordination is very important to 
improve data completeness. reduce GC and will ultimately improve MCCD data quality. Reducing GC can be done 
by improving the training system. The magnitude of the problem requires an evaluation of the training system as 
well as the implementation of cause of death certification. Re-evaluate the competence of the trainer, methods, 
materials, duration of the training, and also the trainees. The addition of GC material during training needs to be 
done to provide a better understanding of the accuracy of MCCD data.

Abstract 
The large volume of data generated across different stages of supply chain has necessitated the adoption of new 
technologies to decipher patterns and yield meaningful results useful to managers and practitioners. Various machine 
learning (ML) tools have revolutionized data analysis across all industrial sectors. ML tools hold immense potential 
in supply chain management (SCM) by providing a comprehensive understanding and analysis of the data generated 
in the supply chain ecosystem. Limitations of existing data analysis tools such as statistical techniques have led 
researchers to dive deep into the ML paradigm to lend a better understanding of the large volume of data generated in 
supply chain processes. The main objective of this article is to understand the concept of ML in decision making and 
classification problems and to assess the utility of ML techniques in various supply chain areas including Demand 
Forecasting, Revenue Management, Transportation Planning, Inventory Management, and Circular Economy.

Introduction 
The fourth Industrial revolution and economic globalization fueled by customer’s expectations has led to significant 
changes in the companies’ supply chain management (SCM), underscoring the competition between supply chains 
rather than companies (Koh et al. 2019). SCM is defined as the management of flow of goods and services and include 
all processes that transform raw material into final products. It includes active streamlining various supply side 
activities to maximize customer value and achieve competitive edge in the market (Richey et al. 2022). A copious 
amount of data are generated on a daily basis due to the integration of business activities with automation and smart 
technology. The data are routinely created, collected, and archived in different processes which is an important 
foundation for process control, design, and control (Naeem et al. 2022). The big data generated from the business 
processes contain meaningful information that has to be intelligently interpreted thereby enabling businesses to attain 
the competitive edge. SCM has seen an explosive growth in big data emanating from various supply chain divisions. 
This has forced companies to develop and implement new technologies that are capable in handling and interpreting 
big data. Since traditional decision support systems are incapable of dealing with big data satisfactorily, it is important

Abstract 
This paper studies the impact of overseas borrowing on economic growth in Morocco over the period spanning from 
2000 to 2020. The empirical exploration is based on ARDL approach to co-integration, allowing the interaction 
between external debt, exports and debt’s source structure. The results show that in long term, external debt and 
multilateral debt have negative and insignificant impact on economic performance. Capital stock has a positive and 
significant effect on economic growth. The results are robust to various tests.

1. Introduction
Growth- enhancing in Emerging Markets Developing Economies (EMDEs) is challenging, since investment- domestic 
savings and import – export gaps are critical. These countries tend to finance investments through foreign debt. If the 
borrower country induces sound macroeconomic policies which promote macroeconomic stability and allocate raised 
funds to profitable investments, economic growth rate will raise and the country will meet its long term debt 
commitments. Nevertheless, accumulating a large amount of public external debt especially by poor countries can be 
a source of macro-financial vulnerabilities, since it is difficult to sustain high levels of indebtedness. And 
consequently, the expenditure of the external debt is reserved only for debt servicing instead of investments financing 
which retards the growth. The negative nexus between economic growth and public external debt is argued by the 
debt overhang hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, when countries are highly indebted, investors anticipate a 
future tax increase to settle debt obligations, therefore, a drop in investments which negatively impacts the economic 
growth. See (Ramzan and Ahmad 2014)  
Besides macroeconomic policies, the impact of public external debt on the economic growth depends also on debt 
structure. Gómez-Puig et al. (2022) argue that a higher percentage of short-term maturity will aggravate the negative 
impact of increasing external debt on economic growth. The effect may result also from debt source multilateral or 
bilateral. According to Workie Tiruneh (2004), bilateral external debt can negatively affect economic growth. In 
contrast multilateral debt might stimulate economic growth as its corresponding interest rate is often low. Ottonello 
& Perez (2019) analyze the relation between economic growth and foreign public borrowing, introducing currency 
denomination of sovereign debt. Accordingly, in the event of growth, sovereign debt is denominated in foreign 
currency, given that the strong negative correlation between the exchange rate and GDP.   
The available literature assesses the impact of public external debt on economic growth using an heterogeneous 
sample. The present paper attempts to conduct an empirical study of the relationship between public external debt and 
economic growth in case of Morocco over the period 2000-2020, utilizing Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) 
models and following the previous literature.

6. Conclusion 
The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of external public debt on economic growth of Morocco over 
the period spanning from 2000 to 2020 employing Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds to co-integration. 
The results show that in long term, external debt and multilateral debt have negative and insignificant impact. Also, 
exports have an insignificant positive effect in the short term but it turns negative in the long run. The economic 
growth is negatively affected by the capital stock in the short run and positively and significantly (10 percent level of 
significance) in the long run. Total factor productivity contributes positively in economic growth. The insignificant 
result is in line with the findings of Qureshi and Liaqat, (2020) outlining the effect of debt threshold on economic 
performance. Accordingly, with a level of debt between 0 percent and 60 percent, the impact of public external debt 
on economic growth is insignificant in lower middle income countries. 
 
The major purpose behind foreign borrowing is to enhance economic growth. In case of morocco, the estimated results 
reveal an insignificant impact of external public debt on the economic performance. It should be expected that the 
external debt drugs the economic performance in the long run since the income is maintained at low levels, whereas 
the debt service is important.

5.4 Validation 
The results are validated with FITCO Detergent Factory by proving them a report of all the proposed improvements. 
The factory accepted the suggestions as future work for them to implement.  
 
6. Conclusions and Recommendations  
Lean thinking is applied in several industries, including the manufacturing industry due to its advantages in eliminating 
wastes to reduce process and lead times, increase productivity, reduce cost, and enhance the working environment. 
This is approached through utilizing the lean manufacturing tools such as the VSM and the 5S system as discussed in 
this paper.  
 
This paper analyzed FITCO Detergent Factory as the case study to implement lean manufacturing tools on. Precisely, 
the process of manufacturing one liter of the hand wash bottles was studied starting from receiving the customer’s 
order, raw materials sourcing and mixing, filling and labeling the bottles, and lastly packaging them prior to shipping 
them.  
 
It was observed that the current process time for one batch containing six bottles consumed 18 min, hence the 
customer's demand of 600 bottles cannot be satisfied in one day. Therefore, by applying lean tools, the process time 
is recommended to be reduced to 3 min to fulfill the demand in one day.   
 
Furthermore, it was observed that the factory layout forces the laborers to move for long distances and bend to reach 
out caps. Also, the laborers' safety is not considered in the Cartoon Stores due to clustered boxes. Therefore, it is 
recommended to move some stations in such a way where not a lot of transportation will be required between one step 
in the process and the one following it. For instance, the cartons should be moved and better placed next to the 
packaging station, the chemical raw materials should be moved next to the chemical mixers, and moving the bottle 
making machines towards the back of the factory to reduce the distance between it and the filling machine station. 
It is important to note that lean thinking is a continuous process that all employees in FITCO Detergent Factory need 
to constantly improve. This can be addressed through building an internal collaborative culture that accepts changes.

Abstract 
This study aims to implement the Master Production Schedule (MPS) method for the production process at Soku 
Bakery. The authors conducted an interview with the owner of Soku Bakery regarding information about current 
production planning which includes inventory records, Bill of Materials (BOM), customer orders, production plans, 
and capacity. With the information, the Soku Bakery production process was optimized by making a Master 
Production Schedule (MPS) from the forecast that has been made. Aside from the data collection, the authors also 
collect literature from books, journals, and research related to Forecasting and the Master Production Schedule. The 
result shows that the implementation of the Master Production Schedule (MPS) can help Soku Bakery to adjust 
fluctuations in demand, minimize waste, prevent shortages, and scheduling errors, and provide more effective cost 
control and more accurate estimates of material, also requirements, and delivery dates.

1. Introduction
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are businesses run by individuals, households, and small business 
entities. The classification of MSMEs is based on the amount of turnover per year, the amount of wealth or assets, and 
the number of employees employed. MSME is a business group with the most significant number in Indonesia. In 
2022, MSMEs were recorded to have contributed 61% of Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP). Most companies, 
especially small medium industries face seasonal demand and production problem, which lead to the emergence of 
lean and peak periods. Such variation in demand and supply is normally beyond the manufacturer’s control (Lim  et 
al. 2014). 
One of the MSMEs engaged in the food sector is Soku Bakery. Soku Bakery is an MSME located in Jakarta. Soku 
Bakery can be classified into MSMEs because they have small capital and profits. This bakery processes raw materials 
into ready-to-eat products with a limited expiration date. The business model run by Soku Bakery is make-to-stock. 
However, the amount of stock made fluctuates and sometimes increases with the arrival of other orders. Therefore, 
sales and production at the Soku Bakery are not good and not optimal.  
Master production scheduling (MPS) is developing plans for identifying which quantities of products should be 
manufactured during specific periods. MPS, therefore, drives operations in terms of what is assembled, manufactured, 
and bought (Vieira and Favaretto 2006). Meanwhile, forecasting is thinking about a quantity, for example, the demand 
for one or more products in the future period (Ishak 2010).

6. Conclusion
Soku Bakery is a micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) in the food industry based in Jakarta. Soku 
Bakery's business model is make-to-stock. However, the stock fluctuates based on customer orders, and the sales and 
production were not optimal. To optimize, Soku Bakery needs to discover a better production planning method to be 
implemented. 
With simple moving average methods, Soku Bakery can find the upcoming forecasted demand. The company can 
better determine the production quantity because it is based on forecasted demand while taking on-hand inventory and 
net requirements into account. Using empirical calculations, the company can avoid situations where the quantity of 
materials exceeds or falls short of the required amount. Then, implementation of Master Production Schedule (MPS) 
is performed as the proposed improvement method, according to the results, the average projected sales for the next 
six weeks 508 orders. If the owner of Soku Bakery sticks to their current routines, they will need to adjust their daily 
supply spending to avoid overstock inventory, which may result in extra spending. The use of this method also resulted 
in Soku Bakery being able to meet the customer demand schedule on time. 
With the result in Soku Bakery, It is essential for micro-businesses to implement this model because the 
implementation of the Master Production Schedule is still rarely used. Overall, the problem of purchasing raw 
materials and the amount of production by micro-businesses, which sometimes does not match the number of requests 
on a specific day, can impact the costs incurred, resulting in waste. By implementing forecasting methods and master 
production schedules, these small companies can forecast the number of requests and prepare better production plans 
to reduce waste. The forecast method and the Master Production Schedule can be the beginning of applying other 
methods in the production process that can help small businesses develop in the future. 
This study was completed with various constraints. These constraints are in the form of a post-pandemic that will be 
faced soon, and the types of SMEs circulating are very diverse. This indicates that in the future, SMEs will experience 
changes in demand with world conditions starting to enter a post-pandemic. In addition, Soku Bakery is one of the 
SMEs included in the type of food. Meanwhile, SMEs in circulation also consist of beverages, products, and other 
types. Thus, the solution offered is still unknown whether it will be effective against other types of SMEs. Future 
studies are needed to study whether the solutions offered can be implemented in other types of SMEs.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a positive impact on increasing public awareness of health. This awareness can 
be seen from the increasing demand for health services and products. PT Otsuka Indonesia as one of the leading 
pharmaceuticals and medical product companies in Indonesia aims to provide innovative solutions for the healthcare 
market. However, PT Otsuka Indonesia faced challenging problems in its product demand forecasting method. PT 
Otsuka Indonesia uses the same forecasting method for all products, resulting in inaccurate and less reliable forecasts. 
This paper aims to improve the forecasts done by the company by comparing forecasting methods and analyzing 
which method is best to use in terms of predicting PT Otsuka Indonesia demand in the future. Actual Demand, Target, 
and Sales Product Data was collected from PT Otsuka Indonesia’s historical data from 2020-2021. Three different 
forecasting methods were compared, namely Weighted Moving Average, Double Weighted Moving Average, and 
Holt Linear Method. Three of them were analyzed by using MAD where each of the products in PT Otsuka Indonesia 
has its own best suited method. 
Keywords 
Production Planning, Forecasting, Weighted Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing and Holt Linear. 
1. Introduction
Public awareness about their respective health is growing over the years. This is because the need for health is one of 
the basic human needs today. In addition to awareness, this is also due to the COVID-19 pandemic that is affecting 
the entire world. All of this can be seen from the increasing human expenditure on health and its services. More and 
more people are often doing health checks either in hospitals, health clinics, or done by themselves at this time. This 
causes the demand for pharmaceutical and medical devices to increase. 
This research paper addresses the application of production planning and control concepts using a forecasting method 
to a manufacturing industry that produces medicinal products including Infusion/Injection Fluids and Ethical Drugs, 
as well as nutritional products for special medical purposes and medical device products. PT Otsuka Indonesia was 
established in 1974 as a joint venture pharmaceutical company with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan. PT 
Otsuka Indonesia expanded its production by exporting products to many countries such as Hong Kong, Singapura, 
Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Philippines, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, and Egypt. For decades, PT Otsuka 
Indonesia has proved itself as the leader in the Infusion Solutions business and keeps challenging itself to develop 
new products that will fulfill customer needs in the future. 
The problem faced by the company is the forecasting method of each product is different from one another. PT Otsuka 
uses a time series forecasting, namely a weighted moving average forecast to generalize the forecasting method for 
all product variants so that the method taken is sometimes inaccurate. Ideally, there should be a different forecasting 
method for every product to make the forecast more reliable and accurate. Therefore, this research was

and the results of these calculations are shown in Table 6. Table 6 becomes a recommendation for PT Otsuka 
Indonesia so that production planning in 2022 can be carried out by the company. 
Table 6. Forecast 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the study in choosing the most accurate forecasting method between 3 different forecasting 
demands to forecast demands in PT Otsuka Indonesia, it can be concluded that each of the products has a different 
forecasting method. Instead of using the same forecasting method on all products, PT Otsuka Indonesia should 
distinguish which forecasting method is suitable for which product. From the calculation above, it can be said that 
BFLUID 500 ML and ASERING 500 ML are more accurate when using Double WMA forecast. Meanwhile, 
AMINOLEBAN INJ 500 ML, PROTEN COKLAT, and INFUSION SET OI-24 are more accurate when using Holt 
Linear forecast.

Abstract 
The current business climate of increasing competition implies that all companies need to be as efficient as possible 
at every level, which includes inventory management. To have adequate quantities of high quality inventory available 
is basically the goal of every company in running their business, this is why inventory management is crucial. In 
addition to it, a well inventory management is also able to help companies minimize the costs of carrying inventory 
which leads to the service and profit optimization. Thus, the implementation of inventory management should be 
considered in every business scale, including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSMEs). Investigating the 
effectiveness of inventory management in MSMEs is way important since the existence of MSMEs itself has a big 
contribution to the growth of Indonesia’s national gross domestic product. The purpose of this study was to optimize 
inventory management in a MSMEs in Indonesia, Warung Nasi Uduk Cani, by applying Material Requirement 
Planning (MRP) method for the production process. The use of this MRP method is intended for increasing Warung 
Nasi Uduk Cani’s efficiency of its material procurement in order to fulfill the customer demand in the right amoung 
and at the right time. The MRP will be built based on the owner’s financial record and bill of material. The results of 
the discussion show that MRP can help adjust fluctuation in demand, reduce waste, prevent shortages, increase cost 
efficiency and more accurate estimates of material requirements and ordering schedule.

1. Introduction
In Indonesia, the domestic economic activities are dominated by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). 
The MSMEs sector shows a vigorous part in the economy being the admission point for business owners to form and 
build new enterprises that can generate wealth and employment (Hamzani and Achmad 2016). The MSMEs sector is 
the central point of people's economic development (Gandhi et al. 2021). According to the official time series data 
issued by the Ministry of Cooperative and SME for the period of 2000–2017, the total number of MSMEs in Indonesia 
increased every year; from 39.784 million units to more than 59 million units by 2017. But there are also some MSMEs 
that stop operating and out of business due to several factors which make MSMEs suffer losses. There are several 
criteria that should be incorporated to delegate more productive enterprise in Indonesia (Nurcahyo 2017). The 
weaknesses of MSMEs that can lead to losses are marketing difficulties, limited access to financing sources as well 
as human resources and raw material difficulty. Many micro enterprises do not pay attention to production planning 
because they think their business does not yet need it (Ramadhani et al. 2021). It is essential that MSMEs get proper 
advisory services. Without proper advisory and guidance, many new entrepreneurs stuck and fail. The focus must be 
given on technological advancements in the operational processes  (Nema 2019). 
Inventory management is important to the overall success of all aspects of business, especially in MSME that produces 
food. The raw materials for food products have a limited consumption period and require a suitable storage with 
certain characteristics. But the implementation of inventory management in MSMEs are still rarely used due to lack

5.2 Graphical Results 
 
Figure 6. Cost Comparison between with and without MRP 
 
The graph shows the material procurement cost that implements Material Requirement Planning is lower than the 
actual material cost that doesn’t apply MRP. This difference can have a significant impact on MSME’s budget. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Currently, Warung Nasi Uduk Cani has not implemented a production strategy, thus allowing business processes to 
not run efficiently and have high costs. Therefore, we propose a  production based on Material Requirement Process 
that our team has made. (Table 5). By implementing MRP, Warung Nasi Uduk Cani can overcome the inability to 
determine the production planning to fulfill the customer demand in the right amount and on the right time, when 
materials should be purchased and how much. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Warung Nasi Uduk Cani is categorized as a Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) that produces many 
types of food. This MSME has not implemented the inventory management in determining the right quantity of raw 
materials to optimize the utilization of inventory and reduce procurement cost. Therefore, Material Requirement 
Planning (MRP) is the appropriate method to solve this problem. 
The MRP result is obtained from the Master Production Schedule (MPS). It contains the production forecast per week, 
actual order per week, and so on, which are essential to calculate the MRP. The MRP shows the quantity of raw 
materials and the total procurement cost per day for 5 weeks to be used as a comparison with the actual procurement 
cost.  
Based on the comparison result, it can be figured that Warung Nasi Uduk Cani can save the material procurement cost 
up to Rp909.000 or equal to increasing 8,09% efficiency using MRP Method. In its inventory capacity as MSME, the 
implementation of MRP in the purchasing of raw materials saves a lot of money to the company.

Abstract 
Planning and controlling material supply is vital for a company to support the production process. The tea industry is 
no exception; this industry requires material planning to optimize its company. Thus, this paper explores the 
implementation of MRP and demand forecasting to increase the overall efficiency by focusing on the tea industry. 
The company studied for this paper is CitraTea, which uses a make-to-stock system to optimize inventory and 
minimize costs. For demand forecasting, we use Holt-Winter’s method to forecast the customer demand for the next 
12 months. We also use the Economic Order Quantity method in making the Material Requirements Plan. As a result, 
the benefit-cost ratio of the 250 ml and 500 ml products before the improvement are 1.738 and 2.027, respectively. 
Meanwhile, the benefit-cost ratio after improvement is 2.281 and 2.817, respectively. These results indicate that an 
increase in the benefit-cost ratio has occurred. The results of analysis, calculation and validation have shown that 
implementing the demand forecasting, and MRP in the company helps reduce the number of costs and increase the 
company's profit.

1. Introduction
Tea is a popular beverage that is consumed worldwide. In many countries, it plays a key role in shaping local tea 
cultures. Tea usually can be found in the market in the form of dried tea leaves and processed ready-to-drink tea 
beverages. Kale and Deshmukh (2020) have estimated the global ready-to-drink tea market size at $29.66 billion in 
2019, and it is projected to increase to $38.96 billion by 2027. As a part of the general beverage market, the tea 
beverage sector has fluctuating consumer demand behavior that shows a sign of seasonality. The manufacturing 
process of the tea beverage can be classified as a made-to-stock manufacturing process (Nasrudin et al.  2017). 
The application of material requirements planning (MRP) in reducing costs is not new, and the topic is still growing 
with new research; for example, studies by Nandhakumar et al. (2021); Zhu et al. (2022)  and Ramya et al. (2021). 
However, studies specifically discussing the implementation of MRP in the tea beverage industry are still rare, 
especially in English. Our search can only find a study in English by Willyanto, Sembiring, and Sanjaya (2019), 
discussing the sugar raw material supply control in the tea beverage industry. The other studies we can find are by 
Nasrudin, Rivana, and Nurbani (2017) and Christi and Yuliawati (2018), all in Indonesian.  
Therefore, this paper aims to explore the implementation of MRP and demand forecasting to increase the overall 
efficiency by focusing on the tea industry. In doing the research, we take as our case a tea company named CitraTea. 
The company, located in Bekasi, was first established in 2018. CitraTea has three products: Green Tea, Chamomile 
Tea, and Black Tea, with bottle sizes of 250 ml and 500 ml. In addition, there are two types of products sold: products 
with sugar and products without sugar. CitraTea's market segment is people who like quality tea drinks. In addition,

respectively. These results indicate that an increase in the benefit-cost ratio has occurred. 
 
6. Conclusion and Remarks 
CitraTea is a tea company that makes tea drink menus for sale to consumers. In running the company, this company 
uses a make-to-stock system and a level strategy system in aggregate planning. However, CitraTea does not have a 
well-planned production scheduling and inventory control. This circumstance can result in companies losing 
opportunity costs to increase their profits. 
 
By forecasting demand using demand forecasting and MRP calculations as well as the EOQ method, companies can 
maximize their profits. This condition can be seen by comparing the cost-benefit ratio data before and after forecasting, 
which shows an increase in the cost-benefit ratio. In addition to the terms increase in profit, the application of this 
method also resulted in companies fulfilling the customer demand schedule. Other than that, this method 
implementation helps the company in minimizing the possibility of the production capacity not meeting the customer 
demand and ease in analyzing how many raw materials are to be purchased to meet the demand. 
 
In developing the material requirements plan, it is important to consider the variations in the demand and supply 
parameters and the robustness of the logistics chain when estimating the demand and economic order quantity. 
However, as the raw materials used by CitraTea to produce tea beverages are sourced directly, these variations can be 
minimized. The fluctuation in consumer demand, on the other hand, is handled by using the Holt-Winters forecasting 
method. Nevertheless, as a piece of research, we believe that this paper will be a beneficial contribution on the topic 
of the implementation of MRP in the tea beverage industry.

Abstract 
Aggregate planning has been widely used by apparel manufacturers to gain maximum profit by finding the optimal 
solution between maximizing sales and minimizing production cost. Commonly, small apparel companies use 
chase strategy, where production rates are varied for each time period to meet changes in demand. However, 
without an appropriate demand forecast and well-calculated production planning, this strategy might not 
accommodate the fluctuating demand. It can cause recurring product stock outs which increases the number of 
unmet customer demands. To improve the company’s production planning, the number of demands is forecasted 
using single moving average (SMA) method for each week of the upcoming month. The forecasted demand is 
then used to plan the production quantity using Material Requirement Planning which helps ensure that all the 
demands are met while avoiding over-production by taking on-hand inventory into account. Comparison between 
the former and the improved production planning method shows an increase in the company’s sales, increasing 
profit by 37,33% or equal to Rp3.360.000. This concludes that the method proposed in this paper can be used as 
a simple yet effective way to improve the apparel company’s production planning, hence increasing the company’s 
profit.

1. Introduction
Fashion is a term that is familiar in daily life. Fashion is generally identified as clothing, in fact what is
said to be fashion is everything that is trending in society. It includes clothing, appetite, entertainment,
consumer goods, and others. Related to the trend in society that changes through time,  the fashion
industry seems an opportunity that never ends. According to Alex Thio in his book, Sociology, ""fashion
is a great though brief enthusiasm among a relatively large number of people for a particular
innovation"". The phenomenon of huge fashion demand has created consumptive behavior and the thirst
of ready‐to‐wear apparel. It is translated by garment producers into producing the large scale of fashion
products which then created a similarity of fashion on most people. This similarity of fashion
encourages some people to stand out and distinguish themselves from the others, especially the younger
generations, on the basis of their courage and interest in innovations (Law et al.  2014).
In order to determine the production rate to balance the customer's order, forecasting and planning play 
a huge role. Good forecasting and planning will lead to on-time delivery, minimum waste, and minimum 
production cost. To optimize the strategy, the company needs to have a well planned production as well 
as raw material stock schedule. Delay in the supply of materials and inappropriate storage of materials 
can result in delays in the completion of a project or even stopping the project, resulting in complaints 
and customer dissatisfaction that will decrease the competitiveness of the company (Rahmat et al.

applying inventory planning, profit of the company will increase.

6. Conclusion
PT. X is a small clothing firm that uses the chase approach as a strategy for product development. Due to a lack 
of well-planned generation scheduling and stock control, this organization frequently experiences out-of-stock 
situations (OOS). This problem arises due to a missed chance. This problem might cause the firm to stagnate or 
perhaps fail in the long run.  
Using the simple moving average (SMA) forecasting approach, it is discovered that the company's production 
capacity would be insufficient to fulfill consumer demand in the next month, April 2022, due to limited supply. 
This, of course, can have an impact on PT. X's profit margins. Material Requirement Planning (MRP) is being 
1170","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

implemented as a recommended improvement strategy to address these issues. This approach was chosen 
because it generates a schedule of the components required at each stage of assembly and calculates the time 
when these components will be required based on lead time.  
As a comparison of the data it can be seen that in April 2022 demand, PT. X can increase its profit by 37.33% if 
the company has implemented MRP in its production planning. The result of the incremental calculation is that 
the profit obtained is relatively small in percentage. However, in its capacity as a small company, the 
implementation of MRP method in planning the purchase of raw materials, in the company getting a significant 
amount of profit. Judging from the small size of the company, this increase has a sizable impact. 
The addition of this strategy resulted in organizations being able to meet consumer demand schedules on time, 
in addition to increasing profits. Aside from that, this method's adoption aids the organization in reducing the 
risk of production capacity not meeting consumer demand, as well as making it easier to determine how much 
raw material to acquire to fulfill demand.

Abstract 
The rapid growth of the Food and Beverages industry leads to a very fierce competition between the companies in this 
industry. ABC Company is one of the players in the industry and to gain more competitive advantages to win the 
competition, The company needs a strategic movement. The company’s current condition is that most of the time, the 
demand is lower than the capacity which leads to an inventory and cost wasting. The objective of this study is to create 
a complete company’s production schedule and meet demand while spending as minimum money as possible on 
production factors. The data were gathered through literature review and secondary data gathered  directly  from  the 
company  itself. The sales data from the past 4 months are used to forecast upcoming 3 months' demand using smooth 
exponential forecasting and moving average method. Furthermore, the data are also used to calculate the aggregate 
planning strategies, such as chase strategy, level strategy, and mixed strategy using the POM QM application. Those 
three strategies then are validated using MPS calculation to find which strategy has the least cost of production. The 
result of this study is that the mixed strategy has the least cost of production.

1. Introduction
To assure the availability of products that fulfill the needs of customers, effective and efficient production is required. 
Thus the implementation of the company’s operations do not have problems related to the planning of production. 
More attention was paid to contributor variables such as labor and machinery (the amount of labor and machinery), 
the production capacity of the machines used, cycle time, and shift scheduling in the process of building an effective 
and efficient production. When the production division has people and machinery reserves to deal with fluctuations 
in demand for goods, production can operate on time and the number of requests can be met. When the amount of 
demand is uncertain, however, a large amount of labor and machinery is usually not utilized (Nasution in Rahmadhani, 
Rahman and  Tantrika  2014) and tends to waste unnecessary cost. The food and beverage companies need to establish 
the correct strategies in addressing the increase of production complexity. 
Indonesia's food and beverage sector is vital to the country's economic development. Despite the COVID-19 
pandemic, the Indonesian food and beverage industry is expected to increase by 3% in 2020. (TheInsiderStories,

6. Conclusion 
There are several critical points obtained. The results from POM QM show that it would be much better if ABC 
company used the Mixed Strategy seen from the lower cost compared to the other two strategies, which was Rp. 
17,092,240. To support this argument, the researchers also calculated the Master Production Schedule and found that 
the order of alternatives from the best to the worst was Chase Strategy, Mixed Strategy, and Level Strategy. In the 
MPS Chase Strategy calculation, there is a shortage in ABC Company's inventory so in this case it would be much 
better to take the Mixed Strategy to be implemented in the future. In addition, we found a pattern that did not change 
significantly for demand and customer orders in the period April 2022 - June 2022.

Abstract 
The healthcare industry is one of the most valuable industries today. Its value is expected to continue to increase along 
with the increase of the world's population. In line with this, the number of requests for assistive devices related to 
services in the healthcare industry is expected to increase. That way, companies need to do good forecasting so that 
production results can be maximized. Based on the research results, the weighted moving average method is the best 
forecasting method that can be used by manufacturing companies that focus on tools in the healthcare sector. This is 
due to the relatively smaller mean average percentage errors (MAPE) value compared to other forecast methods. 
Keywords 
Healthcare, Forecasting, Linear Forecasting, Weighted Moving Average, MAPE. 
1. Introduction
In most developed countries, the healthcare sector accounts for more than 10% of GDP (WHO  2019). Healthcare is 
also one of the world's most important and fastest-growing industries. From global data, the healthcare industry was 
worth $8.7 trillion in 2017, and it is expected to increase at a 5.4 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to 
$10.059 trillion by 2022. The demand for healthcare continues to rise as the world population ages. Countries are 
aggressively seeking more efficient medical solutions and policies, such as precision health and digital medicine. They 
hope to improve medical care efficiency by accelerating the development of advanced medical technologies in order 
to improve health and extend life (Harold  2013). 
Medical equipment such as trolleys, wheelchairs, hospital beds, infusion stands, safety cabinets, and others are 
important needs in the healthcare industry. The availability of this equipment at the hospital is critical, especially if an 
unusual incident occurs that necessitates additional medical attention (Eric et al. 2022). Hence it is important for 
manufacturers in the healthcare industry to forecast the demand and plan their material requirement to be able to set 
business in motion and generate profits. 
Forecasting and planning have an enormous role in establishing the production rate to balance the customers’ orders. 
A good production forecasting and planning can lead to a low production cost, on time delivery system, and minimum 
waste. In order to maximize certain strategy and policy, a company needs to have a well designed production planning 
and forecasting, including well planned material stock schedule. A poor material supply and storage system will have 
a negative impact on production such as delays in the completion of products or even stopping the production, which 
can lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction level that will decrease the competitiveness of the company (Rahmat 
et al. 2020). 
Demand forecasting has been shown to be a significant factor in supply chain improvement, resulting in an increase 
in the companies’ responsiveness to actual customer demand (A. Ross   2004). This paper addresses the 
implementation of demand forecasting to optimize production planning in the medical equipment industry. The

Since W-crit > W we can’t reject the null hypothesis. So, it is concluded that the absolute percentage error value of 
Linear Forecast is bigger than the Weighted Moving average. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The forecast results in 2022 show a decline which is not in line with the addition of the value of the healthcare industry. 
However, PT.X needs to enhance forecasting in its production activities. Through forecasting, the risk of the 
emergence of unmet demand can be reduced. As a company that offers goods that are medium-to-long term 
investment, PT.X needs to choose the right forecasting method. Some of the best known forecasting methods include 
linear forecasting and weighted moving average. Between the two, the better forecast method to use is the weighted 
moving average based on the mean absolute percentage error. This can happen because the method has taken into 
account the trend of the data provided.

Abstract 
Fertilizer is one of the most important things in agriculture. One of the biggest companies that produce fertilizer in 
Indonesia is PT. Petrokimia Gresik that is located in Gresik. In the last two years, Indonesia is facing a lack of fertilizer 
stock to meet the needs of Indonesian farmers. One of the root causes is the high production cost needed for making 
urea fertilizer. This paper discusses the use of Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to improve production cost 
efficiency in the PT. Petrokimia Gresik. The right MRP will minimize the product cost, so PT. Petrokimia Gresik can 
produce more products with efficient costs.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is an agricultural country. As an agricultural country, the agricultural sector is an important sector for 
Indonesia. Based on records from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS, 2022), in 2020 there are around 33.4 million 
farmers engaged in all commodities in the agricultural sector. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the agricultural 
sector at current prices (ADHB) will reach IDR 2.25 quadrillion throughout 2021 (BPS, 2022). This value contributes 
13.28% to the national GDP (BPS, 2022). 
Fertilizer is one of the important production factors for agriculture because the proper use of fertilizer will determine 
the quantity and quality of agricultural products produced. The Ministry of Agriculture has said that until 2021, 
Indonesia's fertilizer needs have reached 22.57 million tons to 26.18 million tons per year (Susanto, 2021). But on 
another side, Indonesia's fertilizer production actually decreased slightly in 2021. It was a decrease of 0.2% compared 
to 2020 which was 12.26 million tons. One of the root causes of this problem is the high cost needed for fertilizer 
production. As one of the fertilizer producers in Indonesia, PT Petrokimia Gresik needs to pay more attention due to 
the gap between production and demand concerning the cost efficiency of production. 
In order to maximize certain strategies and policies, a company needs to have a well-designed production planning 
and forecasting, including a well-planned material stock schedule which is MRP. Material requirements planning will 
help the company to maximize production while minimizing cost. A poor material supply and storage system will 
have a negative impact on production, such as delays in product completion or even stopping production, which can 
lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction, lowering the company's competitiveness (Rahmat et al., 2020) 
This paper discusses the use of Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to improve production cost efficiency in the 
fertilizer industry. By arranging the precise MRP, PT. Petrokimia Gresik could minimize its production cost and reach 
efficiency.

Abstract 
The objective of this study is to improve Coffee Xyz’s production planning method by using sales forecasting and 
Master Production Schedule (MPS). We use Simple Moving Average (SMA) to forecasting. Simple Moving Average 
is one of the forecasting methods that works by calculating the average over a specific time span backwards without 
using weighting. This method is used for data that is unstable, no noticeable trend or seasonality.and does not use 
weighting. By considering cafe XYZ, which is included in the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) 
that does not employ forecasting or MPS in it’s production, we recommend that Cafe Xyz implement production 
planning with forecasting and a Master Production Schedule (MPS) to help them anticipate stockout, increase 
production efficiency, and better control costs by estimating material requirements more accurately and avoiding 
waste in raw material purchases.

1. Introduction
Interest and consumption of coffee keeps growing every year. This phenomenon encourages many people to start their 
own Coffee shop, offering more varied coffee products at a more affordable price range. To be able to set business in 
motion and generate profits, each company must establish the most suitable aggregate planning strategy for their 
business. Maximum profit can be reached by finding the optimal solution between meeting maximum demand and 
lowering cost. Most small apparel companies use chase strategy, where the production rates are varied each time 
period to meet changes in demand. This strategy is deemed most suitable for small apparel businesses since this 
strategy requires lower capital requirement and the resources needed are flexible and inexpensive to change. 
Forecasting and planning play a huge role in determining the production rate to balance the customers’ order. Good 
forecasting and planning will lead to on-time delivery, minimum waste, and minimum production cost. To optimize 
the chosen strategy, the company needs to have a well planned production as well as raw material stock schedule. 
Delay in the supply of materials and inappropriate storage of materials can result in delays in the completion of a 
project or even stopping the project, resulting in complaints and customer dissatisfaction that will decrease the 
competitiveness of the company (Nurcahyo et al. 2020). Forecasting and planning are critical in establishing the 
production rate needed to balance the customers' orders (Regina et al. 2021) 
1.1 Objectives  
The objective of this study is to improve Coffee Xyz’s production planning method by using sales forecasting and

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
By considering cafe XYZ, which is included in the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) that does not 
employ forecasting or MPS in it’s production, we recommend that Cafe Xyz implement production planning with 
forecasting and a Master Production Schedule (MPS) as shown in Tables 3 and Table 4 to help them anticipate 
stockout, increase production efficiency, and better control costs by estimating material requirements more accurately 
and avoiding waste in raw material purchases. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Cafe Xyz is a coffee shop business in Kolaka that is included in micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME). The 
café does not use forecasting or MPS in its production. Cafe Xyz operates on a make-to-order basis. But it is felt that 
there is a problem in the process of purchasing raw materials that relies heavily on customer orders, which are uncertain

every day. To improve the Cafe Xyz's production planning, it is necessary to find a suitable production planning 
method to implement. 
Using the simple moving average method, Cafe Xyz can find forecasts of future demand. Companies can determine 
the quantity of raw material purchases better because it is based on forecasted demand taking into account existing 
inventory and net needs. By using forcasting and MPS calculations, this business can anticipate stockout, increase 
production efficiency, and better control costs by estimating material requirements more accurately and avoiding 
waste in raw material purchases.

1. Introduction
Ginger (Zingiberofficinale Roscoe) belongs to the family Zingiberaceae (Wagner 1980) and genus Zingiber. Other 
names of ginger are African ginger, Black ginger, Cochin ginger, GanJiang, Gegibre, Ingwer, Jamaican ginger, 
and Race ginger. Turmeric, cardamom, and galangal are other notable members of the ginger family. The English 
botanist William Roscoe gave the plant the name Zingiber, derived from a Sanskrit word singabera which means 
horn-shaped due to the protrusions on the rhizome (Katzer  1999). The genus includes about 85 species of aromatic 
herbs from East Asia and tropical Australia (Bhatt et al. 2013).   
Ginger is grown throughout South Eastern Asia, China and in parts of Japan, Austria, Latin America, Jamaica and 
Africa. India is the top producer of Ginger, followed by China, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand, but the most 
expensive and high quality varieties come from Jamaica, Australia, and South India (Gayur and Gilani  2005). It 
is mentioned in ancient Chinese, Indian, and Middle Eastern periodicals and has long been valued for its aromatic, 
culinary, and medicinal properties (Langner 1998). Ginger is also grown as a decorative plant. Patterned foliage, 
deliciously perfumed flowers in a rainbow palette of colors and surprising seed pods make the ginger plant an 
interesting and noteworthy ornamental plant.Cautleya, Globba, Roscoea, Kaempferia, and Siphonochilus Are 
grown for ornamental and medicinal purpose but not for spice (Branney 2005). 
Concerning the recent condition of pandemic Covid-19, ginger has become a high demand commodity in the 
market. Credibility of ginger efficacy that can boost the immune system effectively and maintain good health 
condition of the body. From the existing high demand, there is a various problem of unsynchronized supply and 
stock of the ginger itself. The minimum quantity of salable products will affect the consumer behavior which 
results in less profit and gaining loss. Inconsistency of supply chain on the production management is the main 
problem that needs to be correctly solved. The solution for better improvement on production management is 
yielding the production scheduling model. The main purpose of the production scheduling model is to find the 
most effective production schedules (Nurcahyo R. 2016) 
1. 1 Objectives
This research aims to help ginger companies to fulfill customer demand despite the uncertainties and the
fluctuating demand level in order to avoid losses on the shortage or excess production of said item. Specifically,
moving average method model functions are to analyze and determine data obtained from the ginger factory
production.
In addition, this research maximizes and increases the revenue of their business from the production aspect. 
Moreover, this paper also takes accuracy of the forecast result to be able to determine the right amount of products 
needed.

Table 15.  MRP of Herbs in January 2021 
 
Lead time: 0

*1 sachet of red ginger = 0,0005 kg herbs 
 
The MRP of watered ginger, white sugar, palm sugar, and herbs is calculated to satisfy the following demand in 
January 2022.  The usage of Material Requirements Planning (MRP) in determining the production quantity and 
inventory level is a form of improvement strategy that was used to prevent out-of-stock situations in January 
2022. The company can better determine the production quantity because of the data that was forecasted. The 
forecasted categories were forecasted demand, inventory, and net requirement. Using these calculations, the 
company can prevent the occurrence where the quantity of materials exceeds the amount needed for production. 
Decrease in the number of unmet demands will increase the amount of products sold, which would result in the 
company's overall profit.  
 
5.4 Validation 
Table 16.  Error summary of the forecasted data and the average of actual data 
 
 
 
The error shown by the value of MAPE, MAD, and MSD are the accuracy that were measured by being the most 
common measurement in forecast error. Table 16 shows that among the other data being measured, the  MAPE 
of demand and production that were forecasted has low inaccuracy. Demand forecast has under 2% error and 
production forecast has below 3,5 % error. We can conclude that a single moving average can be used to forecast 
demand and production capacity in a red ginger drink company.  
 
6. Conclusions 
In this research, after analyzing the graphic for the forecasted data and actual data, the errors were calculated to 
measure the difference between forecasted data and actual data. From the previous numerical results, we 
concluded that the graph for demand was inconsistent and had an irregular pattern and the pattern of production 
has decreased in the past 4 weeks. The factory is using the Make-To-Order (MTO) method and as a result, the 
production demand does not follow a predictable pattern. When using a moving average model, it works the best 
when the data has a reasonably linear trend and follows a definite pattern. However, in this particular company, 
our data does not reveal a significant pattern or any linear trend as moving average models simply smooths out 
the variation in the results. 
 
The accuracy of various statistical techniques and MAPE predictors were studied in this paper. For the purpose 
of researching that, we gather the data of 1 year sales and capacity of production at this company. Based on the 
number of MAPE, MAD, and MSD that have been calculated, we estimated that the number of MAPE is less than 
5% for the demand and production of red ginger drink. The forecast accuracy was enough to show that the forecast 
was fairly accurate. 
 
According to our calculation in production planning, we can see that the company has a problem in stock 
management and has many occurances in out-of-stock situations. Using Material Requirement Planning (MRP), 
the company can decrease the chance the products stocks outs and ensure the materials are always available when 
needed. This strategy can increase the overall profit of the company and decrease the chance of having an 
ineffective production.

Abstract 
The increasing complexity of international supply chains, the rise of consumer power and technological development have 
all brought about a clear change in the position and role of supply chain members. The port as a key factor in these 
international supply chains has been largely influenced by certain movements, including increased cooperation, mergers 
and integrations. In this context, the Supply Chain Management organization appears to be an essential lever to improve 
the performance of ports. However, despite the increasing attention given to the study of port logistics chains, the 
contributions remain modest compared to those observed in other sectors, notably the automotive and aeronautical 
industries. Most of the research on performance measures of port logistics chains actually focuses on measures of the 
internal performance of a terminal port. 
Indeed, the lack of consensus on the definition of Supply Chain Management (SCM) and the complexity of the 
relationships between supply chain agents in general and the port supply chain in particular make it difficult to study the 
performance of the port supply chain.  
The objective of this paper is to contribute to the study of the influence of the SCM organization on the performance of 
the port supply chain and on the elements of a tool for measuring the performance of port networks. This paper 
approaches port supply chain performance from a multidimensional view, integrating a financial dimension, a commercial 
dimension, an internal process, and learning and innovation. This article also has the advantage of integrating the 
perspectives of the different stakeholders.

Abstract 
Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because of the heat continuously produced inside of the earth, the 
use of geothermal resources are utilized primarily for the use of electric power generation. PT. Pertamina Geothermal 
Energy (PGE) now manages 5 areas for extracting geothermal energy around the country. In carrying out energy 
extraction in those five areas, PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) requires a fuel supply. Fuel receipts and fuel 
consumption that occur in those five areas at PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) often occurs in situations where 
supply acceptance and consumption are different.  Therefore, a forecasting method is needed that is in accordance 
with the characteristics of the PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) company data type in order to get the most 
accurate forecast results for supply planning in the next period. So, by analyzing the type of historical data of the 
company, we will do a forecast with 2 methods; single moving average and single exponential smoothing. By 
comparing the forecast results from both methods, it will be analyzed which method is more suitable and accurate for 
the type and trend of PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) company data. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because of the heat continuously produced inside of the earth. The 
use of geothermal resources are utilized primarily for the use of electric power generation, whereas the other uses are 
utilized mostly for space heating and other direct uses. In the last year, the demand for geothermal energy in Indonesia 
has increased by about 10% every year. It happens because there are many communities that start to use electric 
networks in their daily life. PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) started to survey and exploit more than 70 areas 
in Indonesia that can be utilized for producing electric energy since 1974. And right now, the company is managing 5 
areas for extracting geothermal energy around the country. 
The 5 areas where Pertamina geothermal energy is used to extract geothermal energy are Karaha, Lumut Balai, 
Lahendong, Ulubelu, and Kamojang. In carrying out energy extraction in those five areas, PT. Pertamina Geothermal 
Energy (PGE) requires a fuel supply. The fuel supply needed by PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) consists of 
two types, namely diesel, and petalite. Fuel receipts and fuel consumption that occur in those five areas at PT. 
Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) often occurs in situations where supply acceptance is lower than consumption 
or situations where supply acceptance is higher than actual consumption.

6. Conclusion  
From our analysis, we obtain the data for MAPE by using the Single Moving Average method in PT. Pertamina 
Geothermal Energy (PGE) project area which includes Karaha, Lumut Balai, Lahendong, Kamojang (diesel), and 
Kamojang (pertalite) to be 40, 63, 24, 40,19 respectively, while using Single Exponential Smoothing we obtain the 
data to be 30, 39, 23, 23, 13 respectively. The verdict is that all of the area project fuel consumption has lower MAPE 
with the Single Exponential Smoothing method compared to the Single Moving Average method. It means that the 
Single Exponential Smoothing method has a lower rate of error than the Single Moving Average method, hence our 
conclusion is that the Single Exponential Smoothing method is the most accurate method of forecasting in PT. 
Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE).

Optimization Study: Bolt Food Delivery  
Haifa AlShathry , 
Alfaisal University, hblshathry@alfaisal.edu 
Abstract 
Bolt, referring to the speed of bolt, is a Saudi delivery company, delivering goods internally 
throughout the kingdom. It was founded by a group of women who did not always have enough 
time on their hands to leave their homes for groceries, medicines or meals. Therefore they have 
decided to create a delivery company for the sole purpose of delivering food from restaurants to 
the consumer. The company was launched in May of 2016 before many new delivery companies 
began taking toll throughout the city. Bolt mainly does two things, deals with restaurants varying 
from fast food to gourmet, and employs drivers that fall within a certain age group of (25-45) to 
ensure a certain level of service. Bolt then takes these two things and combines them allowing for 
a seamless food experience. Orders are done through the Bolt app on the mobile phone, and a 
delivery is quickly at your door. 
Bolt Food Delivery is a company mainly looking over food deliveries from different restaurants 
to different people around the kingdom. The company holds a large employee fraction of 
employees and signs deals with over 50 restaurants. Today, the company has employed us as 
engineers to analyze an optimization study. This optimization study will allow for the company to 
be able to make more informative decisions on how their company should steer from now on  
Taking into account the cost, revenue and hence profit of different optional services will allow us 
to be able to look at what point profit is maximized and hence make decisions on where changes 
should be made. Primarily our first objective was to maximize profit in the most efficient way. 
Our second objective was to denote the company's present worth for an investor's purchase.  
Since Bolt’s daily goal is for each driver to complete 15 deliveries per day, controlling the delivery 
time and the number of drivers will deem the most effective when it comes to the overall profit. 
Bolt aims to maximize their profit in order to improve their delivery service, therefore the 
reexamination of their choice of delivery time and the number of drivers will be based on the most 
ideal results found by different methods of data collection and analysis. A number of conclusions 
were drawn as a result of this investigation. This study may be reevaluated on a continuous basis, 
giving managers the flexibility to run on what-if scenarios and gain meaningful insight into the 
impact of resource changes on profitability.

Abstract 
Nigeria has encountered numerous power issues in recent years, including limited and irregular power supply, high 
power costs, and underdeveloped power facilities, all of which have had major negative consequences on the country's 
socio-economic development. To improve power availability in buildings and ensure adequate usage efficiency, this 
paper presents the development of a smart electric power distribution algorithm for multi-source and segmented loads, 
for implementation on distribution boards. This research aims to develop an algorithm that may be used to support the 
current building wire infrastructure in Nigeria, allowing for 24/7 reliable power supply and effective management of 
limited power supply in buildings. It employs a multi-source and segmented load system to provide reliability and 
energy efficiency measures to balance power supply and demand in buildings. Actual data from offices in the 
engineering complex of Niger State Polytechnic Zungeru, Nigeria, was used to simulate the developed system in 
MATLAB Simulink. Results showed that the developed algorithm conserved power by 33.71% compared to the 
conventional distribution board. 
Keywords 
Smart distribution board, Smart distribution algorithm, multi-source, segmented load, energy efficiency. 
1. Introduction
Our contemporary society has become very dependent on the availability of electric power (National Institute of Open 
Schooling  2019). The consumption of electrical energy is a part of our daily life in such a depth that we can almost 
not do without adequate supply of electricity. We constantly need electrical energy for domestic and industrial 
purposes. A nation’s development is measured by the per capita consumption of electrical energy by its citizens 
(Olugbenga et al. 2013). Energy plays a crucial role in the global economy's expansion and socioeconomic 
development. The ability to access energy is essential for an economy to grow sustainably, and its absence could have 
serious ramifications that are harmful to society as a whole (Onyekwena et al. 2017). Industries, agriculture, 
transportation, and the service sector are important sections of the economy where energy cannot be substituted. Future 
energy demand is anticipated to rise in response to rising global population, living standards, and fast industrialization 
(OECD 2012) 
However, the supply of electricity constantly faces challenges ranging from generation down to the final consumption 
(Sambo et al. 2012). The inability to store electricity in its alternating form (a.c) is one of the greatest problems facing 
the generation and supply of electrical energy (El et al. 2020). It has to be consumed as it is being generated and still, 
the rate of consumption has consistently exceeded the rate of generation. Also, the world’s rapid population increase 
and industrial growth has made this even a more pressing challenge. The available energy is very limited to sustain 
the booming world population and this has consequently influenced the high cost of the little available supply.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the Study
The hospitality industry encompasses various sectors such as tourism, gastronomy, entertainment, and
accommodation, including restaurants, retail and grocery stores, bars, cruises, hotels, and other industries that provide
service trades to their customers and visitors. As such, hospitality workers face particular challenges that can put their
safety and health at risk. Especially considering the current years of working amid a pandemic, workers could be more
likely to pose a health risk from being exposed to a severe virus. Hospitality is an important sector of the tourism
industry. It employs millions of people and contributes hundreds of billions of dollars to the global economy due to
the popularity of upscale restaurants and fast-food outlets. Unfortunately, the hospitality and tourism sectors are
vulnerable to the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters and pandemics, often resulting in significant
financial losses. There have been fears that the restaurant industry has been one of the hardest hits by the COVID-19
pandemic amid demands for social distancing.
The hospitality industry faces the most significant health inequalities compared to other workers. In fact, workers face 
high levels of psychological stress combined with low levels of control and job insecurity. Hospitality is a physically 
demanding job that involves many different tasks that present various risk factors such as biological, chemical, 
physical, and ergonomic risk factors. Hospitality workers are exposed to biological hazards when waste disposal, 
pathogens, broken glass, and other bodily waste are exposed to the hotel cleaning staff. When exposed to chemical 
cleaning agents, workers are exposed to chemical hazards that cause long-term respiratory problems. Employees face 
physical hazards when scrubbing bath and shower floors in bathroom floors, causing slip and fall accidents. The 
repetitive motions of vacuuming, scrubbing, dusting, etc., of hotel rooms, require cleaners to move their bodies in 
ways that can strain and even tear muscles and tendons that fall under ergonomic hazards. Excessive workload and 
exposure to other hazards can lead to job stress.

Based on the result of regression analysis in table 6 it was proved that exposure to biological and 
ergonomic hazard can contribute to higher perceive of health safety. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the results and discussion, the researchers were able to do demographic profiling for the respondents in 
which the profile of the respondents were identified. It has been shown that 60 % of the respondents are male ages 21 
to 30 years old, living in the city are most likely exposed to ergonomic hazards and biological hazards in hospitality 
industry. Most of the respondents were said to be exposed to static/stationary position, repetitive task, awkward 
posture, and exposed to bacteria/virus.  
 
In the study, the researchers found most respondents are male with age 21 to 30 years old residing in the city with a 
full time, rank or clerical job and single as their civil status. Since most respondents work in hotel and restaurants, it 
then shows that majority of worker are exposed to ergonomic hazards such exposure to stationary position, exposure 
to repetitive task and exposure to awkward posture. In addition workers are more exposure to virus/bacteria, biological 
hazards, especially this COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
In conclusion, the data calculated can be used as a model in assessing occupational safety of hospitality industry 
workers. The biological, chemical, physical and ergonomic are factors used and significantly shows and assess the 
level of safety of workers. 
 
6. Recommendation 
The authors of this study suggest that the statistical analysis above can be used as a model or basis in assessing their 
workers safety and health risk. Their management then can improve and set a standard for the safety of their workers. 
The authors of this study also suggested to improve this study and/or my require another research as situation such as 
COVID-19 and other virus/bacteria may acquire another health risk for the workers.

Abstract 
Medical practices are greatly impacted by new engineering technologies. For those who suffer from disordered feet, 
several engineering tools are used in designing and manufacturing medical insoles. There is a significant percentage 
of people who need medical insoles due to flat feet, hollow feet, diabetes, etc. The advancement of engineering 
materials, computer aided design, and computer aided manufacturing gave podiatrists the ability to do their jobs better. 
Two advanced engineering techniques were used to design and manufacture medical insoles in this study, one is 3D 
scanning, and the other is finite element analysis (FEA). Podiatrists can create a complete foot solid model using 3D 
scanning and CAD software. Using the same CAD package, the insole could be designed from this model. Different 
manufacturing techniques could be used to create a typical insole using the foot model. FEA enables analysis of the 
disordered foot with different insole designs in order to optimize patient comfort. A statistical analysis was conducted 
in this paper to prove the unique needs of every foot, even for the same individual. A FEA was conducted to examine 
the effect of the proposed insole on the plantar pressure of the disordered foot.    
Keywords 
Orthotic insoles, Flatfoot, FEA and Reverse engineering. 
1. Introduction
The anatomy of the foot and its biomechanics are crucial for its functions, including walking, running, and standing 
(Wang et al. (2021). There are many foot disorders that affect the foot functions to some extent and, sometimes, cause 
unbearable pain and disablement. Y. Wang and X. Wang (2021) described flatfoot as a deformity characterized by the 
collapse of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. The foot arch is very important for providing flexibility, support, 
and, most importantly, shock absorption (Peter R. and  Rodgers 1987). 
Because the arch is critical to the foot's function, any medical condition that affects its shape and behavior causes 
abnormalities in the sole. Some sole abnormalities result in severe knee and foot pain, especially in the older age group 
when people complain about many foot related issues when walking or running. Foot disorders can be treated with 
orthotic insoles. An insole is the interior bottom of a shoe that sits directly beneath the foot. In order to ensure that 
customers will be comfortable, the footwear industry is always working to develop a better insole. 
The insole is an essential part of footwear, but orthotic insoles are used by many to limit flatfoot discomfort. As a 
result, planter pressure during gait is reduced and redistributed, and thus foot functions are significantly improved. 
The process of designing and building the ideal insole takes a lot of time and requires the expertise of experienced 
technicians (P. Anggoro et al. 2018). Contrary to commercial insoles available on the market, customized orthotic 
insoles are expensive and require a long production time (L. Yang et al. 2022). As a result, an extensive effort was 
made to automate the orthotic insole design and manufacturing process by using CAE and reverse engineering. 
A system capable of treating each disordered foot as a unique problem is necessary due to the sophisticated nature of 
the human foot. In this study, foot scanning using 3D scanners and pedography is used to capture foot details and 
build its solid model. For the purpose of determining the suitability of the design of a medical insole, a finite element 
model is constructed using the solid model. In subsequent stages of the project, the solid model of the insole will be 
used to produce the insole using 3D printing.

6. Conclusion
Nine subjects with flatfoot defects were randomly selected and tested. Their results showed notable differences. 
Statistics showed significant differences between the two feet of the same subject. The differences are affected by the 
subject's body characteristics. According to this study, a standard insole for flatfoot would not be a good choice for 
all subjects. A personally costumed insole should be used for every subject. Moreover, different insoles may be needed 
for each foot of the same subject.  
Based on the range of experiments and verifications conducted in the present work, the following conclusions could 
be drawn: 
1.The decrease in pressure while using insole, give relief to patient as he can walk without pain.
2.Due to the increase in contact pressure the patient feels more comfort and the posture of the body is balanced and
more stable.
With respect to results of this research it is recommended to: 
1.Use customized insoles for people with ill foot, particularly those who suffer severe syndromes, as commercial
insoles may not match their needs.
2.Although FEA is a time consuming process, it might be needed in some cases to assure the comfort of ill foot under
different conditions. FEA has the advantage to predict the stresses in foot structure under different conditions.

Abstract 
Due to the ongoing COVID-19, the education industry was needed to adapt to an online setup. As a result of this 
restriction, the students began to bear more responsibility and exert greater effort, which had a significant impact on 
their motivation to learn in an engaging manner. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical and 
mental stress and motivation, compare motivation levels based on the attributes included in the study, identify 
significant factors that may affect stress, and offer suggestions and contingency plans to avoid such issues in the long 
run. The study falls on a non-experimental descriptive and cross-sectional (type 2) research design. The study used a 
convenience type of sampling and close-ended online questionnaires in the form of a Likert Scale with a sample of 65 
Mapua University SHS STEM students who currently participate in an online class. The gathered data were analyzed 
using Pearson Correlation, Multiple Linear Regression, and Kepner-Tregoe Analysis. The study's findings revealed 
that there was a significant relationship between body image perceptions and physical stress. For mental stress, the 
factors with significant relationships are anxiety, difficulty with change adaptation, and economic pressure. Lastly, it 
was found that both types of stress- physical and mental, affect motivation.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
According to Toquero and Talidong (2020), the COVID-19 crisis significantly affected Philippine education. Given
the condition, all stakeholders in the educational system must understand learners' experiences with online classes
and how they adjust to new living and learning environments (Busko and Bezinovic 2021). The research of Acosta-
Gomez (2018) presented factors that increase and contribute to the high school (aged 15-19) students' stress, which
was adapted in this study. These stress  factors were divided into 6 (six) elements that influenced students currently
under online classes: heavy workload, body image perception, environmental distractions, anxiety, difficulty with
change adaptation, and economic pressure. These elements were divided into two (2) categories: physical and mental
stress.

6. Conclusion  
The researchers have reached some conclusions based on the overall findings of this study in this chapter. The major 
goal of this study, as previously stated, was to determine the relationship between each type of stress and motivation. 
Except for heavy workload and environmental distractions, all factors were positively and significantly associated 
with the appropriate type of stress, owing to the  nature of online classes possibly triggering both types. In other 
words, the levels of stress among senior high school STEM students were highly affected by negative body image 
perceptions, anxiety, difficulty with change adaptation, and economic pressure brought about by the pandemic. On 
the other hand, students' physical and mental stress levels may severely hinder their learning motivation through 
online classes. The researchers, therefore, conclude that while students' dedicated work in class was clear, the 
continual pattern, given the current set-up, may cause learners to feel demotivated and dissatisfied. 
 
Finally, the researchers concluded that body image perceptions significantly affect physical stress. All sub-factors 
of mental stress, including anxiety, difficulty with change adaptation, and economic pressure, significantly affect 
mental stress. Then, as seen in table 10, both types of stress, namely physical and mental stress, affect students’ 
motivation. However, it can also be seen from the results between the subfactors and their corresponding stress that 
mental stress was most likely the type  of stress that greatly affected motivation since its three subfactors were 
revealed as significant predictors. Moreover, according to the Kentucky Counseling Center (2022), virtual learning 
exhaustion is real, and it may make students and educators anxious and stressed.

7. Recommendation 
The primary factor recommended by the researchers has something to do with academic level. In other words, 
future researchers may broaden the study to include junior high and college students since the pandemic 
influenced their motivation in the virtual learning environment as well. 
 
Future researchers may investigate other strands/tracks in light of the previously described issue, as each  strand 
has unique expertise. This implies that, depending on the academic route a person is currently pursuing, a 
particular learner may differ in ability and field. 
 
Finally, the number of respondents could be expanded to obtain even more robust and dependable results. 
Because the study was conducted during the pandemic, the authors were unable to reach other schools; thus, the 
investigation was limited to a single department. In terms of concluding,  a diverse group of participants could 
be valuable and powerful, resulting in superior results and recommendations.

Abstract 
Customer habits have changed with the rapid growth of e-commerce globally. It has become inevitable for 
companies to produce solutions according to the preferences of customers in fast moving consumer goods 
(FMCG) where competition is high. In this study, which looks at the FMCG sector from a broad perspective, how 
customer habits have changed over the years, the growth charts of e-commerce, their sales shares, their importance 
for FMCG products and the effects of same-day delivery on customer decisions are explained. How these global 
issues have changed for Türkiye is also compared with global data. The development of the e-commerce sector in 
Türkiye in recent years is presented. This study emphasizes the importance of e-commerce companies selling 
FMCG to switch to the same day delivery method. 
Key words: Fast-moving consumer goods, e-commerce, same-day delivery, consumer behavior. 
1. Introduction
The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has a proven track record of producing consistent growth 
across mass brands. However, as customer behavior changes and the channel ecosystem shifts, the structure that 
launched the industry to success seems to be under challenge. Companies under this competition must satisfy their 
customer's need to survive in this environment. 
The FMCG industry is always evolving and becoming extremely fast-paced to respond to the quickly changing 
needs of the younger generation. Companies are evolving and efficiently producing new solutions to expand or 
maintain market shares in the competitive FMCG sector. E-commerce is becoming one of the most significant 
channels for these products group. Compared to the traditional channels and the total trade, e-commerce is 
growing much more. In addition, the sales share of e-commerce for the FMCG sector is also growing.  
In Türkiye, the growth rate of e-commerce is also higher compared to the global sector because of the younger 
generation population. That's why both FMCG companies and e-commerce companies which sell FMCG products 
should be up to date to provide the needed solutions for the customer needs. For the e-commerce sector, customer 
satisfaction is also critical. Every year, the number of online buyers grows, and customer behavior shifts 
tremendously.  
Customers are making more demands when it comes to having their products delivered, with a pleasing service 
that is both free and fast. Order delivery time has become an important aspect of the online purchasing experience 
and a decisive factor for many customers. Customers might abandon their orders due to long delivery periods. 
One of the most crucial is same-day or next-day delivery, which has inspired plenty of new business models.

delivery created a wide range of new business models (Chen et al. 2020). Conditions also changed in e-commerce 
logistics, which has entered a rapid growth trend in recent years. 
 
The rapid growth in cargo traffic with discount campaigns created the need for a significant change in the e-
commerce industry in Türkiye. The experience of Covid-19 and the rapid increase in e-commerce traffic made 
this change essential. With Covid-19, the e-commerce sector needed to develop totally. Customers preferred to 
meet almost all their needs with online shopping. This situation increased the demand for e-commerce logistics. 
While companies with developed technology infrastructure came one step ahead, new business models emerged 
to meet the increasing demand, and the number of players in the sector increased rapidly (Ding & Zhao 2021). 
 
The new growth area of Türkiye's leading companies has been e-commerce logistics. In recent years, many 
companies have increased their investments in this sector (Erceg & Kilic 2018). The failure of cargo companies 
to keep up with the speed of e-commerce, which has risen rapidly with Covid-19, has led retailers to initiate their 
cargo operations. Companies started to offer their customers a fast and innovative door-to-door delivery services. 
Customers can receive delivery service on the same day or at any time the next day in addition to the other delivery 
options in their online orders. Türkiye's leading e-commerce platforms are also increasing their activities in the 
cargo area.  
 
Within the scope of the project organized by cargo companies in Türkiye, they agreed with many small local 
businesses. Consumers who shop from the e-commerce site do not have to wait at home for their cargo to arrive. 
Their products will be delivered to the designated small businesses at the closest points to their homes and they 
will be able to reach their products from those points within 3 days without paying any additional fee.  
 
In addition to those developments, the number of entrepreneurs entering the cargo and delivery business is rapidly 
increasing. In this period, where fast and trouble-free delivery became more significant start-ups with a strong 
technology infrastructure are getting popular in the market. Entrepreneurs compete for their same-day and the 
next-day options. After the increase in e-commerce demand, supermarkets also entered the door-to-door business. 
Market chains that started this business before, started fast delivery.  
 
Companies are also creating alternative solutions to solve the undelivered order problems when consumers are 
not home which is one of the most common problems in e-commerce deliveries. Recently, the most favorite 
delivery point has been petrol stations for e-commerce companies.  
 
9. Conclusions 
The fast-moving consumer products market has a direct impact on the performance of growing mass-market 
brands. But the business is hard. In this atmosphere, businesses must satisfy needs of their customers to exist. 
Because of the number of younger populations, Türkiye's e-commerce growth rate is also higher than the 
worldwide sector. As a result, both FMCG companies and e-commerce enterprises that offer FMCG products 
should stay current to supply the necessary solutions for customer demand. Customer satisfaction is extremely 
crucial in the e-commerce industry. The number of online buyers expands every year, and customer behavior 
changes dramatically. 
 
To meet the rapidly changing needs of the current customer needs, the FMCG business is constantly expanding 
and shifting quickly. In the competitive FMCG sector, companies are evolving and efficiently generating 
innovative solutions to expand or preserve market share. E-commerce is increasingly becoming one of the most 
important channels. E-commerce is developing at a significantly faster rate than traditional channels and total 
trade. Furthermore, share of e-sales in the FMCG sector is increasing. 
 
Consumers are demanding that their products be delivered with a pleasant service that is both free and quick. For 
many customers, order delivery time has become a key element of the online purchase experience and a deciding 
element. Long delivery times may cause customers to abandon their orders. One of the most significant is same-
day or next-day delivery, which has created several innovative business models. Conditions in the e-commerce 
logistics industry, which has undergone rapid growth in recent years, have also changed. Same-day delivery is a 
huge bonus for customers. As a result of this situation, the need for e-commerce logistics increased.

As companies with well technology infrastructure got a head start, new businesses developed to meet rising 
demand, and the number of players in the market grew. For Türkiye's leading corporations, e-commerce logistics 
has emerged as a new development industry. In recent years, many organizations have increased their investments 
in this sector. Türkiye's leading e-commerce businesses are also growing their delivery operations. 
 
Placing various warehouses/docks in key locations is one of the available models for expanding and improving 
shipping operations with an acceptable delivery time. According to data acquired by the Turkish Ministry of 
Trade, 5 big cities account for 55 percent of overall e-commerce sales. Placing docks with highly preferred 
products to certain places could be a profi`alternative for an existing running e-commerce company to stay 
competitive. 
 
In addition, new innovations coming globally like Amazon’s physical stores opening. Even though, Amazon is 
the biggest company in online environment, they decided to open offline stores with the most selling products 
without putting any physical cashiers to their stores. Jack Ma, the founder of Ali Baba, brought a new aspect to 
the retail sector combining online and offline operations. Since the e-commerce companies collects enormous 
amount of data gathered from first part customers, he claimed that it would be the future of the sector by using 
these data with offline applications such as physical stores or click and collect solutions like the omni-channel 
applications. By using artificial intelligence, it is likely to be seen that customers would experience unmanned 
physical stores soon. After some successful applications globally, Türkiye would follow those applications to gain 
or keep market share with innovative solutions.

Abstract  
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) through Machine Learning (ML) along with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies can read and understand texts, then extract important information 
from a document and check its compliance with other documents or set of laws or rules under predefined parameters 
which allows the system to interpret data and take decisions. Fintechs have developed AI-based software to take the 
checking role as a replacement for the current highly manual process of document examination under trade letter of 
credit (LC) process, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires skilled and experienced staff to examine 
the documents for compliance with the terms and conditions of the LC and applicable rules. This paper reports our 
preliminary studies in using AI and ML in document checking and examination. Specifically, we conducted 
experiments to compare AI and deep learning results with human checking experts' results. Our findings showed a 
significant reduction in errors and processing times using this automation and an increase in operational efficiency 
and optimization of resources. AI-based solution does not mean digitization as human intervention is still required for 
discrepancies articulated by the automated checks, but it is an important automation step that can assist in the 
development of hybrid solutions aligning paper to digital toward complete digitization of the trade process under the 
supply chain.

Abstract 
Sustainability and risk management are considered as priorities of modern supply chains. Firms are increasingly 
focusing on developing sustainable supply chains; however, the risks attached to this are still under-investigated. The 
petrochemical industry is one of the most important strategic industries in Egypt which has adopted integrated 
strategies to achieve sustainable development. This paper is attempting to identify and evaluate the risk factors related 
to a sustainable supply chain in the petrochemical industry in Egypt The risk factors related to sustainability 
dimensions (environmental, social and economic) are first identified through the literature and then the industry 
experts participated in evaluating and ranking the risk factors using AHP approach. The results of this paper are 
expected to help managers to understand sustainability-related risks and enable them to better manage their operations 
and eventually achieve sustainability.

1. Introduction
Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is defined as the explicit integration of environmental and social goals 
into economic development (Seuring and Müller 2008). SSCM is becoming a strategic requirement for companies in 
different industries (Song et al. 2017). The petrochemical industry is one of the most strategic industries in Egypt as 
many other complementary industries are dependent on it. The structure of the petrochemical industry is cross-linked 
and can be visualized as a network of chemical processes connecting basic feedstock chemicals to the desired final 
products (Al-Sharrah et al. 2010). Due to the nature of the products in addition to the ambiguities that are affecting 
the business environment, the petrochemical sector can be facing difficulties in adopting sustainability practices. 
SSCM can result in long-term strategic advantages for companies, therefore the management and elimination of risks 
to supply chain sustainability is becoming a priority (Valinejad and Rahmani 2018). Several studies were conducted 
to identify the sustainability enablers and indicators in the petrochemical sector in Egypt (Al-Sharrah et al. 2010;

competitiveness, and supply chain sustainability.

Abstract 
The importance of implementing an adequate demand and inventory management process improves coordination in 
supply chain models. The purpose of this research is to analyze and propose the application of a forecasting technique 
and the implementation of a continuous inventory review policy by designing a simulation for a company in the 
veterinary commercial sector. Currently, companies without this coordination obtains an inadequate inventory level 
generating losses in profits and a low demand level of service.  This study presents as a result an optimization model 
based on the ARIMA technique and an inventory model simulated in Arena software. 
Keywords 
Inventory management, Time series, Optimization, Simulation. 
1. Introduction
Nowadays, many companies are adversely affected by poor inventory management, which has a negative impact on 
the level of service offered to the customer and on the company's profits. According to Alharkan et al.(2020)it is stated 
that inventory management plays an important role in sustaining the balance between supply and demand, since it is 
one of the activities associated with the management of customers and suppliers. Also, according to Wang et  al. 
(2020), the role of inventory management is to balance the stock level and customer demand since the uncertainty of 
the latter is difficult to predict. Therefore, due to such uncertainty, two unfavorable and recurring problems related to 
inventory demand arise: destocking and overstocking. For Vo et al. (2021), these problems require companies to pay 
attention to forecasting work because this is the most effective method to know the market demand. In fact, demand 
forecasting is a necessary and indispensable activity for any business. 
On the other hand, demand forecasting is complemented by the recurrent application of tools for inventory 
management and control in the warehouse. One of the most commonly used methods are inventory policies, which 
according to Wang et al.(2020)According to the company, they manage the system's inventory efficiently and have 
two distinct policies, continuous review and periodic review. 
Currently, there are many demand forecasting techniques and inventory control tools to decrease the problem of 
uncertainty between demand and supply. In this regard, Lei et al. (2019) states that many products are handled in the 
inventory of companies that on a large scale pose new challenges in forecasting demand. Likewise, this situation 
causes traditional forecasting methods not to adjust to the high complexity generated by large amounts of inventory, 
resulting in a lower predictive efficiency. However, as he mentions Benhamida et al. (2021)However, as he mentions, 
many companies are relying on their historical sales and demand records, and the availability of new tools and data 
processing methods to design and implement new inventory management systems.

however, these require studies that evaluate their application to pharmaceutical demand models, which represents an 
area to be investigated in future studies.  
In relation to the study of Conceição et al., (2021)who applied a 48% reduction improvement in the inventory value 
after the application of a continuous review policy and the implementation of traditional moving average forecasting, 
the present study differs in the application of the type of forecasting tool. The developed study differs by applying 
time series tools to avoid the difficulty of traditional forecasting techniques that lose predictive effect in situations of 
large quantities of products. However, if it agrees with the results of the study by Conceição et al., (2021) and its 
indicators on the usefulness and its relationship with a correct application of a revision policy. 
Regarding the second part, the realization of a simulation to evaluate an improvement based on a continuous review 
policy, the results presented in the study by Al-Fandi et al. (2019), who after finding results, affirms that by means of 
simulation in Arena it is possible to achieve significant improvements in cost and fill rate in an inventory model. 
Likewise, the application of the simulation technique is present in the study of Alsolami (2020) who states that by 
means of a simulation he finds the forecast of an uncertain demand. Both studies show the versatility of the simulation 
technique in logistics models. Although the present study applies simulation as a technique to emulate an inventory 
model, the described studies do not apply any revision policy in their improvement proposals, so that certain 
parameters such as purchase quantity and supply range are not completely defined. The results of the present study 
show that a revision model complements the realization of the demand forecast. 
 
6. Conclusion  
After the completion of this study, it is concluded that it is feasible to propose an optimization scenario in inventory 
management through the ARIMA forecasting technique based on programming language and the simulation 
technique. The results obtained from this study show that it is feasible to propose an optimization scenario where the 
net profit achieves an increase of 60.18%, which represents US$ 117,671.01 additional to the current situation.  
 
Likewise, it was possible to fulfill the main objective of the study to analyze and propose an efficient demand 
forecasting method and to propose an inventory policy suitable for the company to reduce uncertainty in both demand 
and inventory in search of a demand and inventory balance. For the above, it should be noted that it was necessary to 
apply a demand forecasting technique and a continuous review model based on a reorder point, adding, and proposing 
a defined economic lot quantity and a replenishment period. With respect to the practical implications of this study, 
the procedure developed in this study is presented as an improvement tool that encourages the correct practice of 
inventory management for other companies of the same characteristics, in terms of sector and size.  
 
Finally, the article presented is proposed as a first step for future scientific research related to the topics developed. 
Also, as a proposal for future research is to study the seasonality of veterinary pharmaceuticals and its impact on the 
current logistics model.

Abstract 
In the current context of such high uncertainty in which supply chains are operating, implementing something from 
the Lean, Agile, Resilient, and Green (LARG) paradigms can promote competitive advantage in Supply Chain 
Management (SCM). However, the merge/mixture of paradigms implies trade-offs among the attributes of the supply 
chain, as some are positively related, generating synergies, while others are negatively related, generating divergences. 
The purpose of this paper is to identify the relationships between LARG paradigms in SCM. A decision-support tool 
regarding the LARG paradigms is proposed based on the House of Quality relationship matrix. To do so, a set of 
requirements to satisfy customer expectations as well as a set of performance measures must be identified. The two 
most appropriate sets, defined and ranked by a panel of experts, are used to build the relationship matrix, which is 
used to explore how each performance measure is related to each customer’s expectation.  
This work is an embryo of a new approach to the analysis of the interrelationships between the LARG paradigms in 
SCM. Such an approach will help academics and managers to better identify the trade-offs between the LARG 
paradigms, contributing to the development of more sustainable and competitive supply chains.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the competitiveness of the supply chain (SC) is measured through the deployment of different management 
paradigms, for example, Lean, Agile, Resilient, and Green (LARG). These paradigms have different ways of 
deployment in the SC context.  
The Lean paradigm involves eliminating waste and improving processes, removing non-value added activities along 
SC processes and at the same time trying to reduce costs and time; the Agile paradigm embodies flexible and timely 
actions in response to rapidly changing environments; and the Resilience paradigm aims to make the SC more resilient 
to unforeseen disturbances, effectively combating them or allowing the SC to return to the state immediately prior to 
the instant in which the disturbance occurs or progress to a new, more desirable state; finally, the Green paradigm 
focuses on consolidating environmental awareness into management practices (Carvalho et al. 2011; Cabrita et al. 
2016; Suifan et al. 2019).  
A correct understanding of the relationships between LARG paradigms is a starting point for putting their principles, 
techniques, attributes, practices, and tools into action (Carvalho et al. 2011; Duarte and Cruz-Machado 2011). A good 
structure of the SC is important not only to achieve effectiveness but also to give competitive advantages to companies 
(Buyukozkan and Berkol 2011). Therefore, LARG paradigms will help to define the best SC processes and flows.  
Many aspects must be considered, namely whether the companies have their mindset oriented towards customers’ 
satisfaction and expectations. Bottani (2009) states that the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology can be

4. Conclusion 
The relationship between customers’ needs and performance measures is a challenging subject that this piece of 
research tried to address. The adopted approach, based on the principles of the QFD, proved to be promising regarding 
the ability to characterize complex relationships, notably those associated with Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green 
paradigms. This integration provides a framework for designing SCs that can cope with synergies and conflicts among 
those paradigms. The exploratory research presented will be further developed, aiming at a generalization that can 
support adjustments to specific SC contexts, such as those that characterize the automotive industry or healthcare 
systems.

Abstract 
Space cooling has a long history of adopting unconventional ways. The vortex tube cooling system (VTCS), a non-
traditional cooling system with no moving parts, is the subject of this research. It was designed using CAD and 
parameters culled from the literature. This system's design includes a control valve, and a cold air orifice. To achieve 
the best cooling effect, unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) material was employed in the design. By employing 
the hot and cold ends of the tube, it was feasible to segregate warm and cold air. The amount of hot air discharged 
through the tube was varied to experiment a hot-air/cold-air mass fraction for the most cooling at different inlet 
pressures. In these two sets of testing, the inlet air pressure and mass percentage of hot air in the vortex tube were 
investigated. In the design of the vortex tube, ABAQUS finite element software was used (for simulation/visualization 
of properties such as pressure distribution, temperature distribution, and velocity) for both comparative and validation 
reasons. Physical experimentation yielded a temperature of 22.3°C, which was 9.4°C lower than the entrance air 
temperature. The finite element simulation projected a lower temperature of 19°C. When the hot air mass percentage 
was set to 80%, both the simulated model and the prototype showed the best cooling performance. At maximum 
cooling with an 80 percent hot air mass fraction, the input air pressure for the prototype and simulated model was 4 
bar and 2.6 bar, respectively.

1. Introduction
The development of an alternate cooling approach has become imminent to compete with or completely replace vapor 
compression, which is not as environmentally friendly as space cooling and near-room temperature refrigeration 
applications, at least in part. The air conditioning and refrigeration (hereafter, ""industry"") industry is facing increased 
expectations for energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact.(Brown & Domanski, 2011) Low-promise 
cooling options, absorption cooling, desiccant cooling, mechanical cooling, magnetic cooling, thermoacoustic cooling, 
thermoelectric cooling, trans-critical CO2, are typical types of alternative cooling technologies that have been 
developed over the years to contribute to reducing the greenhouse effect gases because of conventional generation of 
cooling from refrigerants such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Some of the 
cooling technologies are shown in figure 1.

a negative relation was noticed in the simulation. This explains the behavior of the vortex cooling tube phenomenon 
described by (Eiamsa-ard & Promvonge, 2008) (Karthikeya Sharma et al., 2017), as possessing uncertainties. 
5.4.2 
Flow Profile 
From the ABAQUS simulated profile, the swirl was seen throughout the length of hot tube confirming the validity of 
the proposed swirling profile of the injected air in the vortex tube. The correctness of our design was also proven by 
this. The cold air was seen as also having swirls as anticipated. The velocity of inlet air at the maximum cooling was 
590m/s. 
5.5 Proposed Improvements 
Since numerical modelling suffers from some limitations, including the disparity between simulation results and those 
obtained in this research experiments. A traditional k- turbulence model that was somewhat modified by (Bazgir et al., 
2019) revealed that the vortex tube had a clear energy separation effect, and the numerical solutions of the flow and 
temperature fields matched well with the experimental results.(Liu et al., 2005). Therefore, an integration of Design 
of Experiment approach to generate multiple structured data set for the variable of the vortex tube to studying, 
evaluating, and doing a sensitivity analysis on the pattern and effects of both experimental and numerical simulation 
test results for the Vortex Cooling Tube. 
6. Conclusion and Future Work
Here in this research, an attempt is to be made on building the Ranque-Hilsch Vortex Tube model using uPVC material. 
Analysis on the temperature separation as a function of the hot air mass fraction and the inlet air pressure were tested 
and the results proved satisfactory and showed agreement with similar works done previously by researchers. High 
noise and low thermal efficiency are the main limitations of industrial use of the vortex tube.(Eiamsa-ard & 
Promvonge, 2008)(Kurosaka M, 1982). The author in (Kurosaka M, 1982) found an acoustic streaming phenomenon 
involving a vortex tube, which produced noise levels of up to 125 dB from the vortex tube's noise source. Vortex tubes 
may be doomed if these issues continue to be present. A study found that the vortex tube's thermal efficiency peaked 
at 30%, which is significantly lower than that of other thermal devices. Since the vortex tube is less efficient, its 
industrial uses are more limited. The vortex tube is suitable for application where compactness, low cost and small 
areas of cooling are involved. The effect of material properties on the performance of the vortex tube could be examined 
and a comparison made with this work. The maximum mass flow rate of the air compressor of 120l/min (432 cubic 
meter per second) was maintained throughout this research. Examination of the effect of the mass flow rate on the 
temperature separation is highly recommended. Also, cascading the vortex tube like cascading compressor blade sets 
to obtain better performance could also be explored. While the study of vortex tube flow phenomenon is still a bit 
difficult to fully have a unified result with little or no discrepancies, despite multiple experiments and computer 
simulations, a research direction in undertaking a sensitivity analysis of results from vortex tube repeated experimental 
and simulation results can possibly provide a clear insight into the underlying reasons for the inconsistencies.

Abstract 
Businesses must respond rapidly to client demand, withstand competitive conditions, and preserve their 
existence in today's competitive climate. Stock management is one of the most important aspects of 
achieving these objectives. Businesses must first classify the raw materials or replacement parts that must 
be in stock before implementing balanced stock management. One of these classifying approaches is ABC 
analysis. The practice of reviewing inventory to determine how much stock to keep is known as ABC 
inventory analysis. This study is critical for effective inventory management in businesses. ABC analysis, 
one of the stock control methods, was used in this study in a carpet firm in Gaziantep, and the results were 
compared. In this study, ABC analysis, one of the stock control methods, was carried out in a carpet 
business operating in Gaziantep, and the differences between the current situation and the situation after ABC 
analysis were presented.

1. Introduction
Stock management strategies are critical for lowering production costs and increasing production productivity. 
Many organizations face difficulties as a result of inadequate stock management. The size of the warehouse and 
the amount of material objects to be stored are both factors in the storage dilemma. This is a critical decision that 
will impact the stock. In many carpet factories, the raw material warehouse space creates a size constraint. It is 
necessary to keep some yarns more and some less in the warehouse. There are many applications used for stock 
management.The research tries to reveal the effect of using ABC analysis for the management of stocks, which is 
one of the most important economic values of the enterprise, which can be converted into cash. 
Investments inventories play an important role in country and business economies. These investments represent 
an important potential for the further development of companies (Axsater 2006). Excess or scarcity of stock causes 
problems in the industry in terms of both cost and storage for companies in the yarn and carpet industry. Therefore, 
inventory management is carried out at all levels within the enterprise. It can be seen as an area that the manager 
should be interested in. The tendency of the units within the business to hold inventory may differ due to their 
different liabilities (Schroeder 1989). In this study, stock management practices in a carpet business were 
examined and it is targeted to create more effective stock management with ABC analysis, which is one of the 
stock management techniques. 
2. Literature Review
ABC Analysis has been widely used for the inventory management and have a proper control mechanism (Annie 
Rose Nirmala et al. 2021). In 2020, Elifcan Dursun and Ender Gürgen examined the stock management of spare 
parts and materials for equipment used in a sample container terminal in their study. Parts and materials were 
primarily classified by ABC Analysis according to their inventory values, then various criteria were included in

7. Conclusion 
In the study, 10 types of yarn used as raw material in the carpet factory were classified according to ABC analysis. 
The classical ABC analysis results according to the usage amount and cost criteria are shown in Table 3. 
Considering the usage amounts and costs, it has been determined which yarn type is more critical and these parts 
should be considered as important parts. 
 
The study contributed to the process of examining the inventory in order to determine exactly how much stock to 
keep, and played an important role in the development of the inventory level of the enterprise. It is aimed that 
these results will also guide the raw material purchasing activities planned to be carried out in the future. In future 
studies several different stock classification approaches such as VED (Vital, Essential, and Desirable) can also be 
implemented. 
 
This study was carried out for the main yarn types. The inability to reach clear information about the amount of 
use of colors in the enterprise is a limitation of this study. In order to provide maximum benefit in the amount of 
stock in the enterprise, it would be beneficial to conduct a study on colors in addition to the main yarn types. ABC 
analysis work on colors will be efficient in business yarn purchases. In addition, some businesses collect their 
stocks in more than three groups or determine subgroups within the ABC system. This stock analysis method will 
also offer a different perspective to the study.

Abstract 
The application of digital technologies such as 3D modeling, 3D printing, and virtual surgery implemented in the 
medical field makes it possible to improve the representation of the patient's anatomy and to analyze the clinical case 
in more detail than the two-dimensional visualization of images from CT, MRI, and ultrasound. In particular, the use 
of technologies such as 3D printing in cardiac surgery is useful for studying patient-specific cardiac anatomy and 
manipulating the object of study preoperatively. The integration of a preoperative planning methodology integrated 
with the new advanced tools facilitates the cardiac surgeon in developing a more informed and precise surgical 
strategy. Indeed, new technologies allow surgery to be designed and planned in a virtual environment before it is 
performed in the operating room. 
This study reports the application of advanced technologies for aortic arch reconstruction in a virtual and physical 
environment as a tool for the analysis of cardiac pathologies, e.g., aortic dissection. The process involves the use of 
software that can convert the patient's medical information into a three-dimensional digital model that can be imported 
into a virtual environment and then 3D printed.

1. Introduction
The reconstruction and study of realistic 3D printed models is a key point to better understand patient specific 
pathologies. The use of new technologies such as 3D modeling, 3D printing, and virtual surgery in the medical field 
aims to improve knowledge of specific pathologies by combining visual and haptic feedback.  
3D technologies make the planning phase easier, clearer, and more scalable than conventional diagnostic tools, such 
as MRI, tomography and ultrasound. Detailed planning would not be possible without 3D simulation, as the 
representation of the organ would be reduced solely to the interpretation of 2D images. 
In the presented study, three-dimensional anatomical models were reconstructed from CT scans. Possible operative 
actions were evaluated through a preoperative study using virtual simulation and rapid prototyping techniques. 
1.1 Objectives 
The main objective of the study is to provide a methodology to study in detail the anatomy of the aorta in the case of 
an aortic dissection through 3D printing. In this type of cardiac disease, the inner layer of the aortic wall separates 
from the middle layer of the wall itself, creating new and false aortic canals. Therefore, it is important to identify and

such as in studies of complex implants for heart failure. A 3D virtual model and virtual simulation can help better 
position devices for implantation, providing information that cannot be obtained with conventional procedures. 
Virtual surgery technology has the potential to improve procedure planning and to compare the actual result with that 
obtained in the virtual environment. The process can be leveraged by the surgeon who will be able to examine the 
pros and cons of simulated procedures and then choose the best treatment to perform in each specific case. 
For optimal evaluation of the physical prototype, it is interesting to test different materials suitable for additive 
manufacturing with the aim of reproducing anatomically similar features. In this specific case, the testing of flexible 
material can be a great improvement in the twin process between physical, digital and 3D printed object. For this 
purpose, it is important that the physical prototype be as faithful as possible to its real counterpart, promoting a better 
understanding and tangibility that lacks 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study provides a methodology for three-dimensional reconstruction from AngioCT and 3D printing of a case of 
aortic disease. In fact, the methodology allows a 3D model to be obtained first digitally and then physically through 
the use of advanced technologies such as CAD modeling and 3D printing. These technologies are accessible as they 
are open source, leading to a low-cost but quality result. The presented methodology resulted to be flexible respect to 
many medical applications from orthopedy to the presented cardiological case. This is very important since there is 
no need for different tools applied in different medical field. The most important fact remains the interaction between 
doctors and engineers that can accomplish great results.

multiple perishable materials from different suppliers. Each material has a fixed expiry date issued by the suppliers. 
The suppliers are supplying the materials to the company based on the orders placed by the company. There is a supply 
lead-time for a supplier to deliver the ordered materials to the company. Different suppliers have different prices and 
different supply lead-times. The values of materials are constant before their expiry dates, and drop to zero upon their 
expiry dates are reached. While the issued expiry date is fixed, the material shelf-life is affected by the supply lead 
time that is a random variable. The materials are consumed on a first-expired-first-used basis. We formulate the 
perishable material inventory problem as a stochastic programming. The numerical experiments are conducted to 
demonstrate the proposed inventory model can help the company to reduce the inventory cost significantly.

1. Introduction
The management of perishable materials is a prevalent problem in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and Food and 
Beverage (F&B) industries. The value of a perishable product after its expiry date drops to zero, and products which 
have expired may have no salvage value. Over-stocking of products will lead to high wastage and holding costs while 
under-stocking will incur shortage costs and reduction in business opportunities. The key to managing perishable 
products is to keep the right inventory at right time with the right length of stay in the warehouse.  
Motivated by the practical problem from a multi-national company which is a global leading eye care device 
manufacturer. The company purchases multiple perishable materials from different suppliers. Each material has a 
fixed expiry date issued by the suppliers. The suppliers are supplying the materials to the company based on the orders 
placed by the company. There is a supply lead-time for a supplier to deliver the ordered materials to the company. 
Different suppliers have different prices and different supply lead-times. The values of materials are constant before 
their expiry dates, and drop to zero upon their expiry dates are reached. While the issued expiry date is fixed, the 
material shelf life is affected by the supply lead time that is a random variable. As such, the shelf-life of the same 
material from different suppliers may be different when the company receives the material. Thus, non-zero random 
supply lead times and random shelf-life are the two distinguishable features that we have to take into consideration in 
our material inventory model in this paper.  
The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the available literature related to the inventory problem 
we consider in the paper. Section 3 presents the stochastic programming to mathematically model the material 
inventory problem. Section 4 conducts some numerical experiments based on the dataset from the eye care device 
manufacturer. Section 5 concludes the paper with some remarks.

3. Concluding Remarks
This paper studied the perishable material inventory problem from a global leading eye care manufacturer. With
consideration of uncertain demand and multiple suppliers, the perishable material inventory problem was formulated 
as the stochastic programming inventory model. Based on the stochastic programming inventory model, the numerical 
experiments were conducted to obtain the order quantities for all the periods over the planning horizon.  The special 
case of the company problem with one type of material demonstrated that the stochastic programming inventory model 
can save the total cost by 27.32%.  
With the stochastic programming inventory model, we shall continue to conduct the numerical experiments with 
more scenarios. In another note, to develop algorithms to solve the stochastic programming inventory model will be 
our future research along this direction.

4. Conclusion:  
The research area within which SIS operates is that of sustainable electric mobility for users with disabilities having 
particular attention to confined spaces (Figure 16). The design methodology used was the User Centered Design, 
which involves a design aimed at satisfying needs that derive from a survey on the users of the product / service, in 
order to understand its characteristics and real needs. The study was carried out on users attending Bari's Karol Wojtyla 
airport through interviews and focus groups. The design was therefore conducted keeping in mind the results of these 
surveys: different needs for users with different disabilities but a common goal: greater autonomy. SIS is therefore 
configured as an autonomous vehicle for users with reduced mobility available in airport, designed not for a small 
group of users with particular disabilities but for a large group of these, to give them greater autonomy and safety 
during their stay whithin the airport. In fact, SIS is studied in its functional elements such as ergonomics and sizing 
and uses existing technologies such as the level 4 autonomous driving system, voice control, drive wheel technology 
and that of the access ramp. The attention to the technological part continues with the study of the battery connected

to a need for autonomy of at least one day, and its correct sizing. The structural analysis took into account the choice 
of materials that are as eco-sustainable as possible such as PLA biocomposite + flax fiber and biogums and 
demonstrated the excellent mechanical properties of these innovative materials. The entire SIS service has been 
designed and involves the creation of delimited routes and vehicle parking stations that can be used at any time, the 
app, as well as the design of the entire user experience that focuses on improving well-being end user. 
Future developments of the project aim at a prototyping and testing phase, with consequent adaptation to various types 
of delimited spaces such as stations, university campuses and shopping centers. A further implementation could be 
the creation of an application in an unconfined environment in the form of car-sharing in cities, but this would require 
a reassessment of the design, materials, basic speed of the vehicle and its range.

Abstract 
The banking industry is very competitive, and to improve their top lines, the bank wants to improve the services 
offered to their customers. Therefore, the bank spends a lot of time understanding the customer's profile and 
developing relevant propositions and offers for each customer segment. Given the richness of credit card transactional 
data, the authors propose how the bank can apply data analytics to profile the customers and understand their spending 
patterns. In this paper, the authors use RFM analysis to profile the bank customers into various segments, identify the 
most valuable customers segment, and understand their characteristics and purchasing patterns to promote relevant 
marketing strategies to increase bank revenue.

1. Introduction
The financial sector is the backbone of Singapore’s economy. In 2021, the finance and insurance sectors contributed 
14.6% of GDP. According to government data, it is the third significant contributor and has created 190'000 
employment. More than 9400 new jobs in the financial sector were made, according to a report from the Monetary 
Authority of Singapore (MAS). The industry grew by an annual average of 7.2 percent in 2020-21. 80% of the 
people in Singapore own one or more bank accounts and hold multiple credit cards. Banks also provide short-term 
loans like personal loans that the customer can repay in 6 months to 5 years and long-term loans like mortgages 
from 20-35 years. For business or corporate, banks also provide other services such as letters of guarantee, letters of 
credit, or investment opportunities for investors. Banks also offer remittance services or transfers between two 
parties in the same country or around the globe using the SWIFT network. 
As technology advances, consumers today use mobile banking more than others. They also use different payment 
methods like Apple Pay or Android Pay, or mobile wallets as a form of payment. As a result, finTech companies have 
been soaring in recent years. They provide financial inclusion, especially in less developed countries where there are 
physical barriers or enormous investment costs to go to the remote area of the country. In those cases, mobile banking 
has become more critical. Due to COVID-19, the number of people using internet banking or mobile banking has 
increased exponentially over the past two years. As of 2020, as many as 1.9 billion individuals worldwide actively 
used online banking services. This number is forecast to reach 2.5 billion by 2024.

5. Conclusion
To boost the merchant offering and ecosystem to attract the 'Long lost high-value customer'', 'Good value customer,' 
and ‘High Roller,' the bank needs to increase the recency and the frequency of their transactions. We can also include 
the customer's demographics information and run cluster analysis with RFM score, which will be the direction for our 
future research; we can further explore using association analysis or Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to explore the 
merchant categories and merchants that the bank can consider working with. 
We will recommend the following to the bank: 
A Generic Cash Back / Rewards Card, targeted at the certain customer segments mentioned above specifically to 
encourage them to spend larger amounts more frequently.  
Merchant Ecosystem: A seamless multi-brand, multi-category card promotion and rebate ecosystem integrated with 
the bank credit card. The merchant ecosystem is specifically catered to our target customer group, including 
partnerships with preferred merchant categories and merchants. Sign up perks to drive spending on the merchants in 
the merchant ecosystem and develop a stickiness towards these merchants. Promotional campaigns to encourage 
spending within the merchant ecosystem to drive up wallet-share, improve merchant loyalty and increase card 
utilization. The bank could look into acquiring more similar merchants to the currently identified merchants in the 
prime merchant categories, adjusting the merchant mix to keep up with changing and current spending trends, and 
work closely with these new and existing merchants for product and deal promotions for our target group. In light of 
the current COVID-19 situation, the bank can account for the geographical sensitivity, which was evident in our 
insight of transactions being highly location-dependent, predominantly within the residential regions where the 
cardholders live. There could be an introduction of a ""Buy Local"" Campaign where the users of the bank can benefit 
from better rewards and higher cashback by spending at merchants within their residential regions.  
Marketing Efforts: Targeted location-specific marketing campaigns, targeted advertisements on social media 
platforms, and online marketing campaigns leveraging on the recent e-commerce boom. Targeted at existing and new 
customer profiles that fit our targeted profiles.  
To further increase revenue from the larger pool of revolvers, the bank can focus on high spenders or occasional 
revolvers, or both. Increasing transaction volume and value from this group will have a significant impact on 
generating higher revenue for the bank. Through the profiling of these customers, the authors recommended that 
curating promotional/ marketing campaigns based on the identified profiles can help improve customer experience 
and, in turn, drive sales and revenue for the bank.

Abstract 
Globally, electricity systems are transitioning from marginal to dominant renewable energy systems in terms of 
installed capacity and electricity generation shares. This transition has led to the situation of matching dynamic supply 
with dynamic demand. For effective management, electricity system planners and operators must have a clear 
understanding of the dynamics of the supply sources. Knowing these would enable them to identify periods of 
constrained supply and manage resources optimally. Studying 365 supply profiles for a year is a cumbersome exercise 
and it is impossible to observe the supply peculiarities from such a huge volume of data. Therefore, there needs to be 
a mechanism in place to capture these patterns along with magnitude, span, temporal effects and influential factors of 
supply-side variabilities. In this research, we propose a methodology for characterizing variations in supply profiles 
of solar and wind energy technologies by deploying a simulation-based approach. First, a logical clustering method is 
employed to form a smaller groups of supply profiles. Next, probability distribution-based Monte Carlo simulation is 
adopted to refine these groups of supply curves and arrive at a representative supply curve, which is called 
Representative Supply Profile (RSP). This approach is validated using data from Karnataka (a state in India) electricity 
system, and technology specific RSPs are developed. With this, we could represent the 365 days’ hourly generation 
into 10 RSPs for solar and 14 RSPs for wind. The results show that solar and wind supply profiles represent different 
seasonal cycles.

Abstract 
Self-driving passenger cars are already on public roads to support the vision of a sustainable city. The research 
community and academia should further support the human-machine symbiosis of autonomous vehicles, manually 
driven vehicles, and even pedestrians.  
At the time being, most vehicles operate at level 2 of the Society of Engineers (SAE) autonomy scale as they only 
have partial automation. However, they are expected to escalate due to cost reduction of essential hardware 
components (sensors and actuators) and software advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The main 
challenge is thoroughly testing self-driving behaviors and human-machine symbiosis scenarios for improving safety 
conditions and engaging citizens in this concept. 
Video game simulators could provide a basis for testing and showcasing the innovative features of autonomous 
driving. Unreal Engine and Unity are two prominent examples of software tools for creating photorealistic graphical 
environments. In addition, the scientific community and academia elaborate on open-source simulators due to their 
interoperability features for data exchange and their inherent connections with robotic frameworks. 
The proposed research work presents an integration framework for the CARLA simulator. The framework uses an 
integrated Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate the deployment of a fully functional simulation that enables 
users to include an environment for the passenger cars and several Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) that will 
participate in the simulation. The purpose of this study is to exploit the interactions of manually driven and 
autonomous vehicles in a 3D simulation environment and provide evidence that further supports human-machine 
symbiosis on public roads.

3.4 Deep Learning Model 
Additionally, to further explore the capabilities of CARLA we applied Detectron 2 library along with Faster RCNN 
deep learning model for performing object detection through the ROS image data stream derived from the vehicle. 
Detectron 2 is a deep learning framework created by Facebook AI Research that provides state-of-the-art detection 
and segmentation algorithms (Wu et al.  2019). Faster R-CNN is a deep learning model capable of performing object 
detection in real-time with high speed and accuracy. The Faster R-CNN deep learning model was pretrained on 
Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) (Lin et al.)  a large-scale image dataset containing 328,000 images 
and 80 classes of different objects. The vehicle was able to navigate in the environment and perform real-time detection 
of objects, recognizing pedestrians, cyclists, traffic signs, and other vehicles (Figure 3).

4. Conclusion 
In this study, the authors proposed a software tool for creating a network simulation environment that includes multiple 
autonomous vehicles. A GUI is introduced for the CARLA simulator that customizes the simulation environment 
(indicatively selecting a specific town layout, the introduction of manually controlled or autonomous vehicles) and 
initializes a connection with ROS for controlling the autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, Detectron 2 framework is 
utilized along with Faster RCNN DNN model to perform object detection inside the simulation. Experiments with the 
simulation provide evidence that a multi-client simulation environment can support the introduction of autonomous 
vehicles to the wider public while hiding the complexity of the details for the setting up of the command-line interfaces. 
Future work could also provide functions for configuring the autonomous vehicle’s behavior (indicatively slow or fast 
driving or the pedestrian behavior (indicatively passing only from the light of crossing).

Abstract 
Project management in practice has grown very fast in recent years, and the risks managers face become much more 
complexed. As project complexity increases, the randomness of project completion time makes it more difficult for 
manufacturers to incentivize suppliers. In this paper, we consider a situation when a manufacturer outsources two 
parallel tasks to two different suppliers, because of the randomness of the project completion time, one supplier will 
often complete the project earlier (faster) and one will complete the project later (slower). Based on this, we propose 
two different dimensions of the incentive mechanism: one concerns the faster supplier and the other concerns the 
slower supplier. We obtain nine kinds of contracts that a manufacturer can offer to suppliers by combining these two 
dimensions, and different payment schemes manufacturer can offer to the suppliers are included in our analysis. 
Suppliers’ optimal work rates are determined and compared among the nine contract types.

1. Introduction
With the accelerating pace of market change, enterprises must constantly change the operation mode to adapt to the 
new competitive environment. Rapid launch of new products or customized products has become an important means 
of operation for many enterprises to cater for the rapid change of consumer demand. Research data of Pricewaterhouse 
Coopers and MIT show that from 2010 to 2012, the frequency of changes in enterprise operation network structure 
increased by 94%, and the speed of launching new products increased by 87%. Under new environment, the traditional 
supply chain of mass production is gradually evolving into a new supply chain structure composed of individual 
projects, which is called project-driven supply chain (hereinafter referred to as project supply chain) in academia. At 
the same time, many enterprises begin to turn from internal independent innovation to external collaborative 
innovation, due to the constraints of their own resources and capabilities, and in order to respond to market changes 
and reduce risks more quickly. Seeking cooperation of supply chain members and joint innovation with supply chain 
partners has become the main choice of most enterprises. 
Project supply chain usually requires knowledge and technology complementation among supply chain members, 
division of labor and collaboration, and joint completion of specific tasks. The unique characteristics of project supply 
chain bring great difficulties to the management of project supply chain, and among all, the most challenging problem 
is time coordination among all parties with random project duration time. In particular, Boeing has entrusted over 65%

Case IX: Partial Payment (PDP) to the Slower Supplier 
Using the same approach above, we first analyze the second-stage problem, in which one supplier has completed his 
task and the other supplier continues to work on his own task at the rate of 𝜇𝜇. we have that the optimal work rate 
during the second stage is characterized as 𝜇𝜇9

Proposition 11. Under the contract PDP, both suppliers have a symmetric equilibrium at the beginning of the project,

We can easily confirm that 𝜆𝜆IX∗(𝑝𝑝, 𝛾𝛾, 𝛿𝛿) < 𝜇𝜇9

In our study, we focus on the situation in which the manufacturer outsources two parallel subtasks to two different 
suppliers. However, scholars can also consider serial subtasks when attempting to solve project-related problems. In 
addition to pure parallel or serial tasks, we can analyze a project that involves a network of both parallel and serial 
tasks with exponential completion times. Our model can be used as a building block for further study, to examine the 
influence of incentive mechanisms on the operating performance of different parties. 
5. Conclusions
The goal of this study is to compare the effect of incentive mechanisms from two different dimensions: one is an 
incentive mechanism concerning the supplier who finishes earlier, and the other concerns the supplier who finishes 
later. The manufacturer can outsource two parallel tasks to two different suppliers considered in our analysis, and we

assume that the two subtasks have the same workload and difficulty. With a combination of different payment timings 
and payment amounts, we obtain nine types of contracts that the manufacturer offers to the suppliers.  
 
There are a number of extensions we can further continue to study when we pay attention to the field of project 
management. It needs us scholars to pay attention and time to do research and show some managerial implications to 
lead guidance to the practical world. We believe that in the near future, great advances will be achieved in academic 
research by scholars working on this topic and this will further give guidance to the real-world business applications of 
project management.

Abstract 
This study is motivated by the optimal shipment problem of B-yol, an international 3PL company that specializes in 
cross-border ecommerce (CBeC) logistics outsourcing services. Traditional third-party logistics (3PL) cannot keep up 
with rapid development and requirements of CBeC. B-yol collects outbound shipments from shippers and consolidates 
shipments in its cargo terminals. The consolidated shipments are subsequently shipped to international warehouses of 
e-retailers, for subsequent delivery throughout Europe. In the volatile ecommerce markets, the 3PL has to adjust its
traditional freight consolidation strategies to simultaneously meet service commitments and minimize transportation
cost. Stochastic arrival times of shipment orders makes the situation even more challenging. Therefore, in this study
we develop a model to optimize total cost for the company, which consolidates loads from various cross-border
ecommerce shippers at its facility. The model’s output is the optimal timing of the shipment, namely how long should
shipment orders be held and how much should be consolidated before a shipment is sent. Shipment orders
stochastically arrive and wait to be served, incurring a discount cost for waiting. We model this problem as a discrete-
time Markov Decision Process, defined over a finite horizon. Using the monotonic properties of the optimal cost
function, we developed a simulation algorithm to determine optimal consolidation strategies for the batch service of
CBeC customers. Finally, we conducted numerical experiments to observe the results of the proposed approach under
various parameter value scenarios.

Abstract 
The management of e-waste by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) in Gauteng Province was investigated by 
exploring their involvement in the management of the end-of-life electronics through the Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) take back schemes. The study also investigated the general e-waste management situation in 
South Africa by establishing and assessing the underlying aspects of EPR in e-waste management in the Information 
and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. Literature and applied information on e-waste and EPR were used, and 
special focus was paid on end-of-life computers. Despite the challenges in e-waste management, stakeholders strive 
towards holistic sustainable e-waste management. Policy directions based on the gaps identified in the current e-waste 
management strategy were recommended. It is recommended that e-waste management policies and regulations 
guided by the EPR principles as highlighted in the waste management legislation be implemented. In addition, 
knowledge transfers from developed (with working EPR schemes) to developing nations is recommended. EPR has 
been identified as an effective tool in the management of e-waste. The research outcomes will be instrumental in the 
identification of enhancement options for the implementation of the EPR principle.

1. Introduction
Modern technology has witnessed the rapid increase in electronic equipment with Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) networking infiltrating and affecting present day life. Moreso, the current digital revolution trend 
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterised by a combination of technologies has obscured and bridged the 
physical, digital, and biological spheres’ gap. The trend is even noticed in some remote areas of developing nations 
(Osibanjo & Nnorom  2007). ICT growth rate has been attributed to the rapid product innovation and replacement 
(Cook & Das  2011) as there are new designs released with improvements to  the equipment’s capacity and also 
decreasing their lifetime (Planned Obsolescence) (Satyoro, et al. 2018).  For instance, technological advancement has 
led to the migration from analogue to digital technologies, from Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) to Liquid Crystal Display 
(LCD) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) flat screens.  (Satyoro et al.  2018). Consequently, this results in an increase 
in the volume of waste from these products when they reach their end-of-life or become obsolete. This waste is termed 
electronic waste (e-waste) and refers to unwanted, non-working or obsolete electronic products that have essentially 
reached the end of their useful life.  E- waste generation rates are increasing globally and The United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) (UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) 2013) for example forecasts a 
500 % increase in  obsolete computers by 2020, both in China and in South Africa compared to the 2007 levels.   
Globally e-waste is exported from developed nations and imported into developing  for diverse purposes and has 
attracted global attention because part of e-waste is transferred across borders for  recycling purposes or charaded as 
end-of-life used goods or donations (Yu, et al. 2017) (Tansel 2017).  This is despite the prohibition of export according 
to  the Basel Convention, a treaty that aimed at reducing transboundary movements of hazardous waste from 
developed to developing nations (Song, et al. 2017) and the Bamako Convention, a treaty of African nations 
prohibiting the import into Africa of any hazardous waste.

6.3 Adoption and implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility 
Having EPR regulations ensures producers take full responsibility for the lifecycle of their products, past end of life 
phase. It is envisaged that these regulations will, if properly enforced will prevent end of life  electrical and electronic 
products  – most of them potentially harmful to the environment   are disposed of in landfills. The regulations are also 
meant to ensure products are recovered and recycled as much as possible, rather than adding to the growing e-waste 
problem. Moreso, there is need for  mandatory labelling of second-hand products, donations and refurbished products 
as a  means of tracking the producer.  
 
6.4 Recommendations to the manufacturers  
 There is a need for the producers to accommodate all relevant stakeholders. This could be done by creating intensive 
awareness programmes to ensure consumers are aware of the impacts of improper disposal of obsolete EEE. The 
producer may introduce incentives as a way of luring the consumers to bring back obsolete EEE and review the 
programme and determine its effectiveness. Stakeholder involvement and level of convenience is a very crucial aspect 
in e-waste management hence end users should be aware of the existence of the management scheme by the producers. 
It is also recommended that collection points for the obsolete EEE should be accessible to both the consumers and the 
producers. 
 
Conclusions and future research  
E waste management is an imminent issue as specific legislation  has just been promulgated hence enforcement 
challenges may be an issue. With the increase in the use of ICT equipment, e-waste generation rates is bound to 
increase at a rate faster than recycling and recovery. There is therefore a need for effective measures to be implemented 
so as to address the issue and prevent the risk posed by e-waste and the threat to the environment and human health. 
In the inadequate enforcement of specific legislation, some stakeholders have come on board to address the situation. 
Most of the strategies applied are on a voluntary basis. These include eWASA a non-profit organisation which works 
with stakeholders that include manufactures, informal traders, EEE distributors  handlers to manage e-waste 
effectively. The organisation, in collaboration with the industry, developed guidelines to ensure safe and sustainable 
recycling processes of e-waste. However, there are some stakeholders, especially the informal recyclers, who are still 
involved in unsustainable e-waste processes. The producers agreed that e-waste had to be tackled in a holistic manner. 
Although this may increase production costs in the initial stages, the benefit of the environment far outweighs the 
negative impacts of not engaging in proper e-waste management.  
 
Though this study looked into specific group of stakeholders, it is imperative that management of e-waste should not 
be restricted to only the end-of-life but also consider the cradle-to-cradle  approach in the quest for a Circular Economy 
in  line with the Sustainable Development Goal number 12. Overall, there is need for the improvement of the waste 
management infrastructure and perceptions towards recycling through involving all stakeholders concerned to raise 
awareness on e- waste legislation as well as the harmful effects of e-waste. The government should also consider 
supporting the industry driven e-waste management approach. Thus, it can be concluded that EPR is the possible 
mechanism of managing e-waste and that all stakeholders should work in an integrated manner so as to ensure the 
challenges faced in managing e-waste are addressed.

Abstract 
The sequencing of groups of jobs on a workstation, when each group is periodically released, is a common scheduling 
practice in manufacturing.  When the objective is to minimize the sum of completion time, it becomes an NP-Hard 
problem.  Solution to small instances of this problem, and most NP-Hard problems, can be found using integer 
programming algorithms such as branch-and-bound or cutting plane strategies.  However large instances must settle 
for an approximate algorithm using some heuristic or dispatch rule.   
In this paper, we present a composite dynamic dispatch rule named “Gap or No Gap” (GORNG) for tight schedules 
of large instances of the 1 | rj | Σ Cj problem that performs better than other commonly used approaches. Our approach 
is novel in that it is counter-intuitive to keep a machine idle sometimes when work is available.  We prove that in 
some cases it is better to force idle time rather than to schedule the next available job when the goal is to minimize the 
sum of the completion times of all jobs.  The proposed Composite Dynamic Dispatching Rule (GORNG) was tested 
using four randomly generated datasets. The results prove that our rule consistently performed better than both the 
Gap (G) and the No Gap (NG) rule. In the four data sets, GORNG was better 75.00%, 72.73%, 85.16%, and 71.88% 
of the time with reference to our objective of minimizing the completion time.  
Since most scheduling scenarios involve future demand that is not always known in advance, our proposed dispatch 
rule “Gap or No Gap” (GORNG) provides a better strategy with reference to the objective. Our proposed algorithm 
has important applications in practice. Operations Managers should realize that scheduling all unfinished jobs on hand 
does not guarantee an optimal solution all the time as there are certain instances where it is better to force idle time 
rather than scheduling all the unfinished jobs.

Abstract 
Digital transformation is very important in the development of public and private organization. To establish a circular 
economy, digital transformation requires enablers such as deploying blockchain applications. The study presents 
blockchain technology (BCT) application in supply chain management (SCM) to identify how it impacts on a digital 
circular economy transition. Blockchain, as a foundational technology for digital SCM, attributes in transparency 
drives trust in the products and shapes a circular economy (CE) performance. CE transaction in SCM requires various 
capabilities of blockchain such as immutability, reliability, and traceability. The potential research directions and 
managerial implications could integrate blockchain-based technology to digitize SCM system. The methodology of 
this study uses a systematic literature, analyzing 39 articles from the year 2016 to 2022 to present the benefits, risk, 
or limitations in different sectors, and scrutinizing BCT applications in SCM. Subsequently, the results are presented, 
showing the advantages of blockchain-based SCM for organizations. Additionally, it is crucial of blockchain-based 
SCM performance to research from a digital CE perspective. Consequently, the realistic of BCT applications in SCM 
across various sectors are acknowledged. Finally, it presents the current situation and future recommendation.

Abstract 
In the quest to improve the quality of health services and ensure more excellent patient safety, healthcare institutions 
look for alternatives that could help them achieve this goal. The Lean methodology has been a solution found by these 
organizations. This study has explored through Lean healthcare literature i) main barriers and facilitators to 
implementing the Lean approach into healthcare service organizations, and ii) practices and tools of Lean used to 
improve them continuously. One hundred two documents retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases were 
analyzed to reach the search goals. Through content analysis, the main barriers to Lean program implementation within 
healthcare institutions are related to resistance to change, low level of staff involvement, firm commitment to a cultural 
change, departments working in a silo approach, and misunderstanding of Lean concepts and its benefits. On the other 
hand, the main facilitators are support and engagement by leadership, training, and development of workers, and cross-
functional collaboration. This study also contributes to labeling the most frequent Lean practices and tools – value 
stream mapping, fishbone diagram, and SIPOC. The findings of this research provide practical implications since the 
barriers and facilitators raised from the literature will support healthcare professionals in their Lean healthcare journey 
in their organizations and consequently improve their competitiveness through a high level of efficiency, quality of 
care, and practitioner satisfaction.

Abstract 
The statistics on financial performances of Indian-Urban Road Transportation Organizations (I-URTOs) indicate that 
almost every I-URTO is facing huge losses in operating city buses. Considering monetary loss and increased fuel cost, 
there is a need to address decision problem(s) to minimize the cost of city bus operations (CCBO) without increasing 
bus fares. These buses traverse many non-revenue generating distances. One such distance is the 'dead kilometers' 
(DK) which is the summation of the distance traversed from the depot to starting point of first trip and ending point 
of last trip to the depot without carrying passengers. A report by the Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) 
revealed more than 27 crores DK being incurred in 2016-2017. An efficient allocation of city buses to depots (ACBD) 
not only reduces DK but also reduces CCBO. The problem of minimizing DK is addressed widely. However, since 
every bus has a different mileage per unit of fuel, minimizing DK cost (DKC) is more appropriate, which has not been 
considered in India. Hence, this study considers this issue. Since ACBD can be viewed as a special type of 
transportation problem, 8 best initial basic feasible solution (IBFS) methods reported in the literature are considered 
to reduce CCBO. From the performance evaluation, the best-performing method is identified. As this is an ongoing 
Ph.D. dissertation work, many future research activities like developing and/or including a greater number of IBFS 
methods, considering depot operating costs/cost due to CO2 /etc. are in the pipeline as immediate future research 
issues.

1. Introduction
Every Indian Urban Road Transportation Organizations (I-URTOs), managed by the respective State Road Transport 
Undertaking (SRTU), provides public transport services. This is a dominant mode of transport in any urban city to 
meet the heavy passenger traffic and contribute to the national economy. Further, it is necessary for a country like 
India as the population is expected to further increase from 121.1 crores to 152.2 crores during 2011-2036 (Census of 
India), and the majority of them cannot afford private transport. So, people living in the urban cities rely heavily on 
the I-URTOs for their daily commutation. Hence, without increasing the city bus fare, most of these I-URTOs want 
to reduce the cost of their bus operations. 
 This can be addressed using a number of operations management decision problems such as efficiently/optimally 
identifying the number of buses with respect to every route, efficiently/optimally allocating buses to depots, increasing 
the number of routes where more revenue is generated, increasing the number of trips being taken in areas where the 
number of commuters is high and so forth. This study identifies and addresses one such decision problem related to 
the allocation of city buses to depots (ACBD) without changing the existing route and schedule of each bus.  
The city buses in I-URTOs traverse various types of non-revenue generating distances. One such non-revenue 
generating distance is the 'Dead Kilometers' (Mathirajan et al. 2010). The dead kilometer is defined as the total distance 
traversed by buses from the depot to the respective starting point of the trip before the start of the first trip and from 
the ending point back to the depot after the end of the last trip. The report by the Central Institute of Road Transport 
(CIRT), which is committed to improve the efficiency and productivity of the transport sector with particular emphasis

Abstract 
Eggshells are household waste that in large quantities can harm the environment. The very high content of Calcium 
Carbonate 90% is the main component of the composition of eggshells. This study aims to identify the manufacture 
of dental biomaterials; toothpaste. The eggshell was calcinated with the sintering temperatures of 350, 500, 600, and 
900 0C for 10 minutes and reacted with Hydroxy o- phosphate. From the spectrum results obtained, the best 
hydroxyapatite was at a sintering temperature of 900 0C. The samples were compared to the addition of NaOH and 
the control variables. The additive fortification was carried out in preparations including glycerin, baking soda, and 
betel leaf extract for antimicrobials. The tested pH was the best in the range of 4.5-10.5. From the results obtained the 
best is sample 10 where the pH is neutral 7 organoleptic appearance was semi-solid.

1. Introduction
Every day around the world, millions of tons of eggshells are disposed of as organic waste (Wu, Hsu, Hsu, Chang, & 
Ho, 2016). In Indonesia, according to data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), egg production in 2017 was 
1,506,192 tons and in 2018 continued to increase to 1,644,460 tons. So far, eggshells have only been thrown away 
because it was considered to have no economic value, but instead polluted the environment (BPS, 2018). The eggshell 
contains CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) which reaches 95%. The high calcium content can be utilized as the source of 
hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6OH)2 synthesis for synthetic bone, which can be described as a bone containing calcium 
ions that can be combined with orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, hydrogen, or hydroxides. Research on 
hydroxyapatite (HAp) is still being intensively refined. The results of several research findings found that HAp has 
the potential as a catalyst for various chemical reactions (Mori et al., 2002; Jun et al., 2004), as an adsorbent because 
of its high affinity for heavy metal ions (Lusvardi, Malavasi, Menabue, & Saladini, 2002); (Krestou, Xenidis, & 
Panias, 2004), for medical and dental applications because of its biocompatibility and bioactivity capabilities 
(Mansour, El-dek, Ahmed, Abd-Elwahab, & Ahmed, 2016); (Ravarian et al., 2010). HAp can be used as a base 
material for composite pastes, supported by an inorganic content of 95.1%, organic matter of 33%, and water at 1.6%. 
Most of the inorganic materials consist of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) about 90.9% of forming bones and teeth. 
Toothpaste is a composite that can maintain the aesthetics and the health of teeth, in the form of a paste or gel. Most 
commercial toothpaste contains chemicals such as sodium lauryl sulfate which easily can cause irritation of oral cavity, 
ulceration, decreased salivary solubility, and changes in taste sensitivity. A good toothpaste should not cause tooth 
abrasion, changes color of the filling which will causes the imbalance of oral bacteria. The use of natural ingredients 
of toothpaste continues to be developed such as baking soda for tooth whitener, eggshell powder as a source of Ca2+, 
clove oil as a sensitivity additive, glycerin as a preservative and moisturizer, lemon peel as a substitute for citric acid, 
orange peel, peel bananas that serve as a substitute for iron. The aim of this study is to identify the effectiveness of 
chicken eggshells as a source of calcium for toothpaste by using precipitation methods and thermal methods, and 
studying the effectiveness of hydroxy o-phosphate in extracting calcium from egg shells. 
1.1 Objectives  
Commercial toothpaste has been using synthetic active substances as the main ingredients, causing ulceration and 
other complaints if used for a certain period. In this research, we will study the production of toothpaste with active 
ingredient hydroxy apatite enriched with natural ingredient additives so that it meets the criteria as a toothpaste 
product.

Figure 7. Result sample 10 – 12 after dried in the oven 
6. Conclusion
From the results of the research that we have done, we get two parts, namely liquid and liquid and semi-solid. Where 
that meets the requirements in making toothpaste is the result of sample 1 without NaOH and sample 4 with NaOH in 
semi-solid form. In the FTIR Spectrometry Test, there is a range of wavenumbers from 900 to 1250 cm-1 which is 
formed in all samples showing the PO4-3 group. Only sample 10 formed the OH group in the wave range of 3500 – 
3600 cm-1. In samples 1 and 4 there is more noise or disturbance due to the presence of water than in sample 7 which 
tends to be less. Because the presence of water causes the thermal process to be not optimal in samples 1, 4, and 7. 
Thus, it is an indication that the thermal treatment up to 600 0C has not yet formed Hydroxyapatite (HAp). To ensure 
this, it is necessary to do a further XRD Test.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic pushed for the sudden implementation of online classes; students were forced to work 
within a new adjustment to continue their education. The prolonged virtual life eventually led to the popularization of 
video conference fatigue, commonly known as Zoom fatigue. However, literature on the relationship between video 
conferences and fatigue is lacking. The researchers conducted a one-way ANOVA and regression analysis on data 
collected through a survey questionnaire in identifying the factors that has a significant effect over the fatigue of 
students attending online classes. In the failure, modes, and effect analysis, the results indicated that length of 
synchronous sessions, posture, and temperature are the factors that have a proven relationship with the types of fatigue, 
namely mental, physical, and physiological fatigue, are present during video conferences. Risk mitigation for the 
priority failure modes is limited to what could be controlled by education institutions and the availability of immediate 
resources to students, such as class schedules and meditated breaks. Future researchers should analyze fatigue 
quantitatively to understand the relationship between video conferences and fatigue.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic brought about an unforeseeable change in society as the government restricted the general 
mobility of the public. It was done by enforcing public health measures such as quarantine of the infected and social 
distancing to minimize virus transmission (Anderson et al. 2020; Nussbaumer-Streit et al. 2020). In the Philippine 
setting, policies are divided into mass and granular types for the local and national government units, following the 
recommendation of the World Health Organization. These policies range from social distancing, mass testing, closure 
of public places, and wearing a face mask and face shield (World Health Organization, n.d.; Talabis et al. 2021).  
In the adjustment of educational institutions to the enforced policies, traditional classes are replaced with online 
education as the learning process of a student cannot halt. Online learning is a type of learning that utilizes electronic 
devices and allows the student to control the pacing of their learning (Singh & Thurman  2019). According to Huang 
et al. (2020), online education is fully utilized to its total capacity if the elements of uninterrupted time for video 
conferences, user-friendly online tools, online platforms for interrelationship building, and diverse educational 
resources are present.

Abstract 
In the last decade, the transportation sector has experienced increased demand for transportation for several reasons, 
including rapid urbanization and the need for transportation. This demand has added another challenge to city 
challenges. Morocco, as an African country, aims to improve its transport systems. This process has already begun 
with developing national road safety strategies (SNSR1 and SNSR2) and implementing several projects, such as TGV, 
electric buses, tramways, Etc. For proposing a new idea of an intelligent transportation system (ITS), a comparison of 
Morocco's transport systems (conventional and new) was made with those of some African countries (South Africa, 
Kenya, Senegal, Kenya, Rwanda, and Morocco). The Moroccan Mobility Management Center (3MC) project is a new 
vision of traffic management, and it acts as a software package that contains intelligent transport systems by default. 
For 3MC to promote sustainable mobility, it should include some default software like Urban Traffic Management 
System (UTMS), Intelligent Parking Management System (IPMS), Urban Bus Management System (UBMS), and the 
Intelligent Taxi Management System (ITMS).

7. Conclusion  
The transport field is an indispensable element in the economic activity in different countries. However, the increased 
travel in the urban environment has led to several problems that hamper traffic (congestion, state of transport modes, 
pollution, rapid urbanization, Etc.). The idea of the 3MC system is to relieve urban traffic by exploiting the intelligent 
transportation systems integrated into or imported. The solutions in 3MC are UTMS, SGPI, UBMS, and ITMS. All 
these systems will promote sustainable mobility.

Abstract 
In this paper, a hybrid population-based, bio-inspired metaheuristic is applied to solve the PID controller parameter 
tuning problem. The applied algorithm, denoted by CSASOS, is a multi-population metaheuristic that combines good 
characteristics of the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) and the Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS). In CSASOS, one 
subpopulation follows the search rules of the CSA algorithm and is responsible for finding promising regions in the 
search space. The second subpopulation follows the search rules of the SOS algorithm and is responsible for 
performing a refined search in the promising regions to find the best solution for the optimization problem under 
consideration. Numerical experiments are carried out in order to compare the performance of CSASOS with the 
performance of the stand-alone versions of both CSA and SOS in the solution of a PDI controller parameter tuning 
problem, which is a common problem that appears in many industrial applications. The results show that CSASOS 
presented a better performance in comparison with the competing algorithms.

1. Introduction
Bio-inspired metaheuristics have become popular in the last decades due to their ability to find close-to-optimal 
solutions for complex optimization problems in a reasonable amount of time. These algorithms have been successfully 
applied to solve a wide range of optimization problems that commonly appear in different industry sectors (Slowik 
and Kwasnicka 2018). Several bio-inspired algorithms have been proposed such as Particle Swarm Optimization 
(PSO) (Kennedy and Eberhart  995), Ant Colony Optimization (Dorigo et al. 1996), Genetic Algorithms (GA) 
(Holland  1992), Differential Evolution (DE) (Storn and Price  1997), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) (Mirjalili et 
al.  2014), among many others. However, despite the large number of bio-inspired algorithms available in the 
literature, the development of new algorithms and improved versions of the existing ones is still a relevant research 
topic. Another relevant research topic is the development of hybrid metaheuristics that use characteristics of different 
existing algorithms to build new metaheuristics with better performance. It has been reported that hybrid algorithms 
developed from proper combinations of basic metaheuristics may result in more efficient and accurate algorithms 
(Blum and Roli  2008). 
Different hybrid algorithms that combine two or more existing metaheuristics are available in the literature. For 
instance, Singh and Singh (2017) proposed a hybrid algorithm that uses the intensification capability of PSO and the 
diversification capability of GWO. An inertia constant is applied to control the equilibrium between diversification 
and intensification. They conducted experiments using several benchmark functions and observed that their algorithm

meets the design requirements, the use of an adaptive PID controller provides a much better response in terms of 
overshoot and peak time. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Comparison between the step responses obtained with a standard and an adaptive PID controller 
 
Then, we designed an adaptive PID controller using the proposed CSASOS algorithm. For comparison purposes, we 
also designed adaptive PID controllers using the stand-alone versions of CSA and SOS, which are the basic 
metaheuristics combined in CSASOS. For each algorithm, a Monte Carlo approach with 50 repetitions was conducted. 
Table 3 presents the parameters obtained in the best solution found by each algorithm. In addition, Table 3 shows the 
statistics for the ITAE indicator obtained with each algorithm over all the 50 repetitions. Based on these results, it is 
possible to observe that the hybrid CSASOS outperformed the stand-alone versions of both CSA and SOS in terms of 
the performance indicator ITAE. The CSA algorithm presented the highest average value and the highest standard 
deviation of ITAE. It indicates that CSA has a low exploitation capability in comparison with SOS. CSASOS presented 
the smallest average and the smallest standard deviation for the ITAE indicator, showing its better capacity to solve 
the optimization problem under consideration.

5. Conclusions 
In this paper, we investigated the benefits of combining the good characteristics of two metaheuristics in the 
development of a hybrid algorithm. In CSASOS, the good diversification capability of CSA and the good 
intensification capability of SOS are used. The CSA subpopulation finds promising regions of the search space while

the SOS subpopulation intensifies the search in the promising regions to find the final solution for the optimization 
problem under consideration. 
 
A case study was presented in which the proposed CSASOS is used to define the parameters of an adaptive PID 
controller, which is a problem that appears in many industrial applications. The results showed that the hybrid 
CSASOS outperformed the stand-alone versions of both CSA and SOS in terms of solution quality. The ITAE (Integral 
Time Absolute Error) was used as the indicator to assess the performance of the algorithms. CSASOS presented the 
best average value for the ITAE indicator. It also presented the smallest standard deviation, indicating that it 
consistently finds good solutions. 
 
Future research may extend the scope of this paper by investigating the performance of the hybrid CSASOS in other 
classes of optimization problems such as multi-objective problems and binary problems. Another possible extension 
of the work presented in this paper is to investigate new strategies to guide the communication between the two 
subpopulations.

Abstract 
The work-related musculoskeletal disorders have always been a significant health problem for nurses, especially 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were expected to fight on the frontlines for an extensive time and sometimes 
without rest. The president of FNU, Maristela Abenojar, stated that the working conditions of the nurses were no 
longer humane. Several nurses worked more than 12-hours shifts while taking care of as many as 20 patients, 
refraining from having their meals and going to the bathrooms to save PPEs. In line with this, the current study utilized 
regression analysis to determine the risk factors that significantly affect the WMSDs of the nurses. The survey results 
gathered 103 nurse respondents from different hospitals around the National Capital Region. The findings have shown 
that several significant risk factors were identified to influence the WMSDs substantially. Some of the risk factors 
mentioned and the body region that they affected were the following: Working near physical limits and working while 
injured affected the hip/buttocks; safety or ergonomic training experience and work duration affected the lower back; 
an excessive number of patients affected the neck. The study also displayed a comprehensive and detailed proposed 
corrective action to confront the work-related risk factors present among the nurses. Organizational intervention must 
be done to help the nurses reduce their WMSDs and have a healthy work environment. Finally, a deeper analysis of 
each task can help further improve the study results.

1. Introduction
The fight against the coronavirus has been occurring for over two years now since it started to terrorize every country 
in 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID-19 is an infectious disease that originated 
in Wuhan, China. The virus could spread through the mouth or nose of an infected person when they sneeze, cough, 
speak or breathe. 
WHO (2021) mentioned that as of September 6, 2021, there were over 224 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 
a Global scale. In the report made by the Department of Health (DOH 2021), the national case data showed that 
there was a total of over 2 million confirmed positive cases of coronavirus in the Philippines. It also showed that the 
NCR was the top region with the most cases, with 697,033 cases as of September 7, 2021. Based on the COVID-19 
tracker provided by the DOH (2021), 7,100 (68.4%) was the bed occupancy out of the total 10,380 for the early part 
of September. The data showed a higher percentage compared to the bed occupancy of 40.8% for June 2021. Out 
of 156 medical facilities in NCR, 33 facilities have a high risk (70% to < 85%) occupancy rate level, and 47 facilities 
have a critical (≥ 85%) occupancy rate level.  
According to Haddad et al. (2020), nurses made up the most significant part of the health profession and were a critical 
component of healthcare. They have contributed to various world's primary health care achievements. They participate 
during major crises such as natural and man-made disasters, epidemics, and pandemics. Nurses play a significant role 
as key players in the recovery of the patients from being hospitalized and isolated due to the coronavirus and the 
COVID-19 outbreak planning and management.

4. Conclusion 
There were a significant amount of studies about Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders among nurses throughout 
the world. Despite its abundance, there is (limited to) no current published study about the WMSD prevalence among 
the nurses in the Philippines setting, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the identified risk factors 
from the related studies may or may not have been applicable to this study's setting. The absence of relevant studies 
motivated the researcher to examine the working conditions of the nurses amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and 
determine the work-related risk factors affecting their musculoskeletal disorder. One hundred and three nurses were 
able to answer the online survey questionnaire. The survey results were utilized in conducting statistical analysis to 
determine the significant risk factors that affect the WMSDs of the nurses. Several significant risk factors were 
identified to influence the WMSDs substantially. 
 
Furthermore, the significant risk factors were used to develop a predictive model and detailed proposed corrective 
actions. In the present study, several respondents had reported that they were treating an excessive number of patients 
(99.03%), having inadequate rest breaks (95.15%), and working near their physical limits (71.84%). Organizational 
intervention must help the nurses reduce their WMSDs and have a healthy work environment.  
 
The researcher recommends a deeper analysis for each task to improve the study further. Measuring the amount of 
time for each task, showing the specific tasks, activities, job descriptions, the specific training programs, duration and 
date of training, mental specific factors, and the comorbidity of musculoskeletal disorders could be an additional 
component study. Although proposed corrective actions were included in the study, details of the proposed actions, 
which will be covered in a Risk Mitigation Plan, are recommended for future studies.

Abstract 
The major challenge for automotive manufacturers is to customize collaboration with vast supplier networks under 
uncertain conditions, such as unsatisfied quality, delivery shortage, and expensive costs during New Product 
Development (NPD). To address this concern, identifying appropriate criteria is a primary step for defining the best 
supplier performance for new model car development. Previous research has contributed to several criteria for 
performance evaluation with rating methods, but most focused on the mass production stage. However, few studies 
had done during the trial production stage. To bridge this gap, this study provides important criteria for Evaluating 
Supplier Performance (ESP) during the trial production stage by applying the Multi-Criteria Decision Making 
(MCDM) approach through the case study of a famous automaker in Thailand. The eighteen criteria were developed 
from an intensive literature review and thirteen experts survey. Then Consistent Fuzzy Preference Relationship 
(CFPR) approach is adopted to derive the relative importance weight of criteria through four perspectives; Quality 
Performance, Delivery Capability, Cost Compatibility, and Management Support. The objectives of this study provide 
appropriate criteria and prioritize the important criteria for ESP during the trial production stage, which helps to 
improve automaker-supplier collaboration in the automotive supply chain.

1. Introduction
The automotive industry is widely acknowledged as one of the enormous supply chains that need high collaboration 
between automakers and their supplier networks to enhance competitive advantage. As a result of global competition, 
automakers face the highest customer expectations and a race against time to deliver high quality at competitive prices, 
especially in sustainability trends, such as environmental policies and social concerns. In terms of New Product 
Development (NPD), increasing product complexity accelerates technological innovation, and unpredictability in 
customer demands pressure automakers to produce new products faster and more efficiently and launch them into the 
market on time (Sumrit 2020). Most organizations place high importance on NPD. The automaker cannot completely 
design a spare part on their own. For the new model car, many spare parts are supported by supplier networks, 
depending on the part complexity and development strategy. The main goal of supplier development is to assist 
suppliers in improving capabilities to meet project requirements. Each project has unique success variables requiring 
different approaches (Um and Kim 2019). Price, quality, delivery, and service are frequently used as performance 
indicators in supplier evaluation (Zheng et al. 2022). As a result, we require a technique and criteria that can be 
customized to each situation. The comparison of a practical condition between the trial production and mass 
production stages from four popular performance perspectives: quality, delivery, cost, and management, as shown in 
Table 1. The significant differences are the trial production stage required project flexibility of cross-functional team 
collaboration to manage and adjust conditions. (Vanichchinchai 2021a) reported that supplier collaboration is critical 
for supply chain performance in Thai manufacturing industry. On the other hand, mass production requires process 
monitoring and a responsive team to monitor production stability.

important criteria in Delivery Capability. Followed by Reliable Pricing (C11) and Business Compatibility (C14), 
which are the most equally important criteria of (0.043) in Cost Compatibility and Management Support, respectively. 
These findings imply that the most important criteria during the trial production stage are Quality Performance and 
Delivery Capability. Automakers should prioritize part quality and delivery reliability to ensure production stability 
in the mass production stage, which leaves no room for error, corresponding with the ultimate goal of trial 
production established as the best practice before mass production. However, Cost Compatibility and Management 
Support are crucial as supported criteria for automakers which are the keys required to deal with project investment 
and other inevitable changes during the trial production stage. 
5. Conclusion
With various requirements in the automotive supply chain and unpredictability during NPD. Automotive 
manufacturers are considering identifying good supplier performance during the trial production stage. This study 
presents the CFPR method for prioritizing appropriate criteria for ESP during the trial production stage through four 
perspectives, namely: Quality Performance, Delivery Capability, Cost Compatibility, and Management Support. 
Moreover, these findings provide practical implications for managerial collaboration with their suppliers during 
automakers’ new model car development. Correspondingly, suppliers will have a guide to focus on the tangible criteria 
validated by an automaker. 
To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior automaker prioritized appropriate criteria in Thailand during the trial 
production stage. These findings are the primary step in ESP. Future research can contribute to other strategies of the 
automotive development cycle, such as supplier selection and supplier development, to find potential suppliers to 
customize development for segmentation and ranking suppliers' performance for any future business selection (Min 
et al. 2018). Moreover, future research can extend this preliminary methodology into other industries. The concept of 
priority nonconformity index (PNCI) proposed by (Vanichchinchai 2021b) may be applied to assess prioritization of 
supplier performance by comparing importance and performance criteria in future study.

Abstract 
Proper training is a powerful tool to enhance the employee’s performance in any required HSE-related job. The lack 
of HSE training has a direct effect on the adequacy expected from the employee to handle various situations that 
might lead to accidents, injuries, or losses if not dealt with properly. Hence, it is important to provide HSE training, 
which will enable the employees to become more aware and considerate of their safety by avoiding risks. In this 
study, a clear definition of knowledge, competency, and training will be presented, along with highlighting the 
significance of proper HSE training that will have a direct effect on minimizing possible accidents and promoting the 
performance of the organization from an HSE point of view. Moreover, this study also investigates the training 
methods approached globally for employees’ training, and the drawbacks of the training programs offered in the 
present day. To gather the required data, two methods of data collection were utilized to gather the required data 
in order to address the research question, which are online surveys and interviews with subject matter experts. The 
results obtained from the data collection will be presented and discussed, along with a proposed solution for the 
existing drawbacks or shortcomings, and this will be further clarified through a case study scenario of activities 
carried out in confined spaces. The shortcomings that were identified through data analysis of the two methods will 
be resolved in the proposed training framework to fulfill the gaps.

6. Conclusion
An excellent training program can contribute to enhancing employees’ performance in any required HSE-related jobs 
and reducing the number of incidents where their root causes are the competency of the employee. Hence, it is 
important to provide HSE training, which will enable the employees to become more aware and considerate of their 
safety by avoiding health risks. This paper will explain a clear definition of knowledge, competency, and training, 
along with highlighting the significance of proper HSE training that will have a direct effect on minimizing possible 
accidents and promoting the performance of the organization as a whole from an HSE point of view. Moreover, this 
study also investigates the training methods approached globally for employees’ training, and the drawbacks of the 
training programs offered in the present day.  Both online surveys and interviews with subject matter experts were 
used to gather information to find the following shortcomings; 
•
Lack of employee confidence in performing the job correctly.
•
Competency of a trainer and training materials.
•
Ineffective delivery modes in the existing training.
•
Ineffective assessment evaluation
These gaps were identified, studied, and resolved in the proposed solution of proposing a new training framework 
of developing custom in-house training utilizing a new practical training room utilizing virtual reality technology. A 
scenario-based confined space entry activity is carried out as a case study to demonstrate the training framework. 
This new training framework will be more engaging, consumes less time, practical along with methodological 
assessment procedure. 
Further areas of research for the proposed framework can be in utilizing and investing more of the new technologies 
that will be fulfilling the identified gaps that are found in today’s training programs. However, this will require cost 
for developing this program of investing in artificial intelligence.

Abstract 
The combination of Lean and 4.0 technologies in logistics is more and more presented as an essential solution to 
improve productivity and guarantee the economic performance of the supply chain.  Several organizations have 
already implemented, either completely or partially, solutions based on the Lean approach.  The two approaches are 
different and do not lead to the same desired performance results. Big questions are currently being asked if the two 
methods are complementary or independent and what is the right approach to implement Lean Logistics 4.0.For the 
development of Lean Logistics 4.0; this research work presents a methodology that combines Lean Logistics and 4.0 
technologies in three steps: diagnosis, integration of Lean tools and 4.0 technologies.

1. Introduction
The improvement of the supply chain processes is one of the first concerns of the logistics principals: always minimize 
the cost, satisfy the customers, .... One of the most successful optimization approaches applied in industry is 
undoubtedly the Lean approach, which was born in Japan at Toyota in the 1950s, after the Second World War (C. 
Roser et al. 2016). With the increased competition of car manufacturers and extended logistic chains with several 
participants, operations are becoming more and more complex. In this context a new system was invented: the ""Toyota 
Production System"", or TPS, to efficiently organize manufacturing and logistics, including interaction with suppliers 
and customers to minimize costs and waste. The system is also known by the more generic terms ""Lean 
Manufacturing"" and ""Just-in-time production"". This TPS organization model is less pyramidal and relies on collective 
intelligence (C. Roser et al. 2016). An extension of Lean Manufacturing, Lean Management, allowing the optimization 
of the business strategy and related management methods (production management, personnel logistics management, 
etc.), based on the Japanese continuous improvement process called ""Kaizen"" (R. J. Schonberger 2019).

Abstract 
The emergence of 4IR, otherwise known as Industry 4.0, has introduced new communication technologies focusing 
on automation, digitalisation, and the global use of information. As a result, this is drastically changing the process of 
communication in project management. This article offers an exploration of Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies, 
and their impact on communications in projects. Firstly, 38 relevant studies have been identified. Then, a review has 
been conducted to identify the effects of Industry 4.0 integration on project communication. It has been determined 
that Industry 4.0 significantly impacts project communication. The results of this study also revealed that Industry 4.0 
has contributed to the improvement of communication systems of projects, which highly affects the completion of a 
project. In addition, it was discovered that technological advancements are used to improve landscape communication. 
Finally, the deployment of Industry 4.0-based tools facilitates communication in project management and leads to 
greater efficiency through digitalisation and the integration of new technologies. The results of this study are intended 
to guide the project managers and contribute to the field of project management and Industry 4.0. 
Keywords 
Industry 4.0, Project communication, Project management, project. 
1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 is drastically changing the process of communication in project management, as new communication
technologies are being invented. People are now obliged to use high technology appliances, rapidly becoming the
most dominant influence in their working life. Industry 4.0 is the contemporary phase in the industrial revolution,
focusing on automation, digitalization, and extensive use of communication and information technologies in the global 
business environment (Alaloul et al. 2020).
Previously, communication within a project was done by project management software, instant messaging, blogs, 
telephone, fax machines, email groupware, teleconferencing systems as well as word processors (Pitagorsky 1998). 
Industry 4.0 came with new smart systems that enhance project communication. These systems include advanced 
modern sensing, teams integrating physical industrial components, and networking technologies (Gungor  2019). 
The main objectives of project communication include guaranteeing timely generation, storing collection, and 
disseminating project information. Project communication has been defined as an exchange of information and 
knowledge from different points within the project (Rajkumar  2010).  In addition, through communication, project 
team members can collaborate, integrate and share information and knowledge to meet project objectives (Zulch 
2014). 
1.1. Problem statement 
Poor communication often leads to a project not meeting its intended goals and objectives, which results in customers’ 
dissatisfaction as their needs and expectations are not met (Mesa et al.  2016; Wu et al. 2017; Durdyev and Hosseini, 
2020). This may cause a significant loss for the organisation doing the project, since it may not be considered for 
future projects (Discenza and Forman  2007).  
Communication in each stage of the project is key to a successful project (Le Bui Ngoc  2019). Therefore, industry 
4.0 systems help the project team effectively link the areas of cost, scope, time, and quality through communication. 
The industrial revolution needs the leadership to balance innovation and chaos with organizational processes’ solidity. 
Leadership is no longer about tittles but more about organic collaborative processes. This enhances communication

Poor communication remains to be the main source that leads to a project not meeting its intended goals and objectives. 
However, Communication is regarded as the foundation and starting point of all activities in the construction project 
management industry. At all levels of an organization, effective communication is critical to attaining productivity 
and sustaining great working relationships. 
This study recommends the accompanying techniques to improve communication skills in the organization: 
• 
Labour should be upskilled in new communication technologies used in the organization, and have a sound 
understanding of how the different organizational structures function to optimize the technological tools.  
• 
Increase labour engagement - It strengthens the bonds between co-workers and creates a more enjoyable 
working atmosphere. 
• 
It is simpler to establish good workplace communication when you know each other's skills and weaknesses. 
• 
Purposeful direction of communication, and obtaining feedback is a good technique to ensure that no one is 
left behind. 
Further research should focus on assessing the impact of Industry 4.0 on project communication using statistical 
techniques such regression analysis.

Abstract 
The aim of this research is to investigate barriers and challenges associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
adoption and implementation in the logistics operations. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess 
the major categories of challenges as well as specific challenges for each category published in peer-reviewed 
articles that are relevant to logistics operations. A total of 114 articles from six (6) electronic databases (i.e., IEEE 
Xplore, Science Direct, Elsevier's Scopus, Web of Science. Springer link, Google Scholar) were analyzed.  Based 
on the findings, 7 major categories of barriers and challenges of AI adoption and implementation in the logistic 
are identified:(organisational and managerial challenges, technological challenges, economic challenges, data 
challenges, environmental challenges, social challenges, political, legal, and ethical challenges). Similarly, 16 
specific challenges such as lack of top management support, internal requirement-organizational strategy, real-
time response, disconnected systems, technology complexity, skill and expertise, high investment, operational 
costs, AI infrastructure, data standardization, scalability factors, data privacy and security, and insufficient 
operational warehouse space were identified. This research provides a further benchmark for decision making for 
logistics operation managers to deal with challenges and barriers in the adoption of AI in supply chain

Abstract 
Production planning involves scheduling a series of operations in a factory to produce products on time. However, 
with the current increasing trend of customer demands for customisation where many variations are required, 
production scheduling is becoming increasingly difficult. High-mix low-volume (HMLV) manufacturing plays 
significant role to satisfy this trend since it has flexibility through automation to produce many different products in 
small quantities. Yet, such automated factories are prone to irregular events (e.g. line stoppages, machine breakdowns), 
making it a challenge to keep production activities on schedule. It is therefore important to consider irregular events 
as early as possible in the production planning stage to mitigate their impact. This paper proposes a delay prediction 
based on survival analysis to predict irregular events and calculate the disruptions so that they can be anticipated 
through the generation of robust production plans which can be executed at any time. This approach can reduce 
production losses due to production delays caused by irregular events.

1. Introduction
The increasing customer trend for customization accelerates high demands for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) 
to produce a large variety of products in small quantities (Qiao, Lu and McLean 2006). Such production systems are 
known as high-mix low-volume (HMLV) production, and the introduction of an FMS is suitable for increasing 
efficiency, bottleneck suppression and lead-time reduction (Reinhart and Geiger 2011). However, FMSs are usually 
complex and prone to irregular events such as unplanned breakdowns and line stoppages (Javaid  et al. 2022). In 
practice, these events can disrupt the production process and the original production plan may not be realised. For 
example, a cause-and-effect relationship that results in a slightly longer production time may actually cause production 
delays, resulting in products not being delivered to customers in time. Production planning attempts to optimally 
schedule all production processes in advance of the production process. However, if irregular events that disrupt the 
production process are not taken into account, productivity will be low. 
In such cases, robust production planning can be implemented to minimise the impact of irregular events on the 
production process and ensure that the production plan can be implemented at any time. Robust production planning 
aims to assure the smoothness of production in the face of disturbances and to maintain target performance indicators 
in an unstable environment (Gyulai et al.  2015). Robustness in production planning involves a sophisticated approach 
to dealing with predictable or unpredictable changes and disturbances. It can either respond to the occurrence of 
random events (reactive approach) or protect the performance of the plan by predicting the occurrence of irregular 
events to some extent (proactive approach) (Campagne  et al. 1995). In reactive scheduling, production schedules are 
not created in advance. Instead, it is usually determined in real time when required, according to various priorities of 
production requirements, such as minimum delivery time, minimum processing time. Proactive scheduling focuses on 
creating predictive schedules to meet performance requirements in a dynamic manufacturing environment. In this

workflows without significant modifications to the model. The main prerequisite for applying the proposed robust 
planning workflow is modelling the simulation, which can be built quickly if a standard rule can be applied.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
For future work, the authors have identified two potential directions worth further research. The first direction is an 
analysis of the adequacy of the model to handle the latest trends. Survival functions are sensitive to training data, as 
they depend on patterns from the training data. On the other hand, in high-mix low-volume industries, where new 
products may be produced quickly, the actual production process will frequently change the probability of irregular 
events due to the dependency on production parameters. In such cases, the model needs to be brought into contact 
with the most recent dataset to maintain its ability to predict correctly. Therefore, re-training is vital for the long-term 
use of this model. The second direction is the analysis of learning requirements, such as appropriate periods that 
indicate more suitable patterns in the temporal data. The survival function is sensitive to the training data as it depends 
on patterns from the training data. Therefore, when the model is applied to stream data, the survival function needs to 
be adjusted to maintain the stability of the model accuracy. To determine the survival function, the choice of data 
learning is essential. Therefore, a mechanism for selecting appropriate training data is needed. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The objective of this paper is to promote strategies for robust production planning in high-mix, low-volume production 
industries through data-based situational awareness of production variability. Robust production planning requires the 
prediction of irregular events and estimating the disturbances that can absorb their impact on the production process. 
This paper proposes a new method to predict production delays due to irregular events. The proposed idea consists of 
two main stages: predicting irregular events and calculating their impact on the original production plan. A simulation-
based optimisation method using survival analysis is deployed to assess the predicted irregular events without 
increasing the complexity and execution time of the production plan. Through the various parameters tested during 
the experiments to predict production delays, several conclusions can be drawn about the use of the proposed method. 
First, the modelling of production line productivity is highly dependent on the type of statistical distribution assigned 
to each irregular event variable. When using conventional method, obtaining such dataset is very difficult in the High 
Mix Low Volume manufacturing industry due to data limitation. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution 
using time to event (TTE) distributions which is effective for modelling irregular events even when there are no data 
points in the historical data of the target product. This is because survival time analysis assumes that if products have 
similar characteristics, their impact functions will also be similar. Therefore, even if there are zero data items available 
from historical data, the Time to Event data distribution can be estimated from similar product data. Thus, the survival 
time analysis method can overcome the problem of data volume limitations. As a result, the proposed method is able 
to predict irregular events better than conventional methods, showing reasonable prediction accuracy. Experimental 
results also show that the proposed method is effective in reducing production delays caused by irregular events and 
reducing losses associated with production delays. Although the model can be further refined and evaluated when

applied to other manufacturing industries, the model developed can be used by production planners to predict 
production delays due to irregular events, and the method can be applied to other high-mix, low-volume industries.

Abstract 
Risk quantification is an essential step in risk assessment and management, as it serves as a clear metric for project 
risk assessment. To quantify the risks of a project, weights for each risk item should be evaluated, which would serve 
as a percentage of importance of each risk. This study proposes a framework for assessing the weights of risks that 
might arise during the implementation of their projects. The paper first examines the literature, explains the proposed 
framework by tackling risk identification, data collection, initial risk ranking, and risk weight calculations, followed 
by an example applying the proposed framework. A newly designed survey asks the decision makers to provide their 
experience in their recent projects and losses in terms of total project value by this risk item. By doing so, rather than 
asking decision makers to evaluate alternative risk items in a comparative way, consequences by the questioned risk 
item is a dimensionless value. The proposed integrated method uses the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis 
(SWARA) method, which quantifies the weights/relative importance of the risks, which then allows for their ranking 
in order of importance and criticality. The main contribution of this paper is that its method of risk quantification 
solely uses percentages, representing the probability and consequence, rather than a monetary value, which cannot 
always be applicable, especially for critical cases related to risks on human life and other priceless potential losses.

Abstract 
Livability is a major principle for urban planning and politics makers, and its definition and assessment have become 
critical concern upon academics. Therefore, creating livable residential communities that enhance safety, comfort, and 
social relations is one of the main goals among all planners and policy makers. As socioeconomic development 
increases, the microscale living conditions necessitate more immediate attention. In the context of the Middle East, 
the UAE specifically in Sharjah, this study will focus on residential land livability assessment. Different dimensions 
are considered for livability assessment of residential areas based on people preferences such as housing, mobility, 
urban function, urban form, and sense of belongings. All these dimensions are assessed using survey based descriptive 
analysis. The aim of the study is to assess urban livability in Sharjah city through classifying the residential areas 
based on people preferences and spatial analysis.  Finally, to propose and develop a livability index for residential 
area selection in Sharjah city. None of the scholars, however, have addressed the assessment of livability at a finer 
geographic scale, such as the residential community scale. The finding showed that the Emirate of Sharjah is in dire 
need of a tool to measure the livability of residential lands.

Abstract 
Background: This assessment aims to analyze service performance and hospital efficiency by comparing Case Mix 
(CM) and Case Mix Index (CMI), of Health Social Security Agency (BPJS-Kesehatan) claims data for 2017 – 2019.
There are almost 2000 provider general hospitals with various types from throughout all of 5 regions in Indonesia.
Results: The major findings shows the value of outpatient CM is increasing in almost all hospitals as well as for
inpatient care, although there are variations in several regions. Most of the outpatient CM was found continuously
increasing each year and observed highest in type C hospitals except for regions 1 in which type B hospitals showed
the highest CM value. As CMI is heavily influenced by hospital’s capacity, type A hospitals had the highest CMI than
type B, C and D hospitals. Most of outpatient CMI increased, except for type D hospital in regions 1, 2 and 3. The
inpatient CMI for class A hospitals in 2017 and 2018 were the highest than type B, C and D hospitals, nevertheless
type B hospitals had highest CMI in 2019. In 2019 CMI tends to decrease in all class A hospitals. Based on the
findings, many hospitals need to improve their service performance quality due to efficiency and reflect inadequate
resources used.
Conclusion: CM and CMI is a reflection of the type of care a patient receives, the complexity of their cases and cost
of care. Hospitals need to regularly monitor these indicators and unfortunately this has never been done in many
hospitals. In the future, hospitals need conducting analysis to optimize their capacity as type B Referral Hospitals and
make service cost efficiency both for inpatient and outpatient.

Abstract 
The need for comfortable seats rises as individuals spend more time sitting to perform various activities. The design 
and material used for cushioning the chairs play an important part in the overall comfort experienced by the human. 
Traditional methods, like questionnaires, for evaluating seat comfort are not accurate since the interpretation of 
discomfort is subjective and varies from human to human. Thus, this study proposes a system that models humans of 
different anthropometry and seats of different designs and cushion materials using Computer Aided Design (CAD) 
and then evaluates seat comfort by testing the contact pressure between them using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) at 
early design stages without the need for physical prototyping.

Introduction 
Importance of Seat Comfort 
With the digital revolution automating manual work, human tasks are becoming less active as employees rely on 
computers for machine control and monitoring, which results in the employee being seated for a considerable amount 
of time during the day. The American Heart Association stated that sedentary jobs have increased by 83% since 1950, 
and a normal office worker sits for a shocking 15 hours in total every single day, while people with long commutes 
even more (Roberts 2019). This concludes the evident growth in people’s need of having a comfortable seat that is 
well-designed to provide physical support and balanced posture.  
Seats come in a variety of styles and designs. Nevertheless, there are basic features that must be present in a seat to 
ensure a minimum level of comfort to the person sitting, such as backrest, armrest, seat tilt, and cushion. Other features 
that are specific to flight seats include footrests, headrests, and seat pans. Another important factor that impacts the 
comfort of the seat is the material out of which it is made. Common seating materials include memory foam, rubber, 
neoprene, silicone, and plastic mesh. The cushion material can provide a range of flaccidity from soft air-filled 
cushions to hard surfaces. Properties of such materials play a major role in providing the required softness, elasticity, 
and robustness that affect the level of comfort.  
Conventionally, seat comfort evaluation relies on the subjective assessment of individuals gathered using 
questionnaires, scales, or interviews to investigate their perception of the finished physical product. But due to the 
disparity of data that varies on a person's mood and the instability of a person's opinion, subjective assessments must 
be correlated with objective measures (Ulherr and Bengler 2017). As a result, objective evaluations are required to 
measure seat comfort and provide appropriate solutions to improve seat designs before production begins. 
This paper proposes a system to assess seat comfort by running Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on Computer Aided 
Design (CAD) models of human mannequins and different seat designs and cushion materials to expedite the design 
process of new seats. The methodology considers the anthropometric dimensions of the sitters and studies the effect 
of seat features and seat cushion material on the overall seat comfort.

For a two-tailed test with significance level of 95%, the p-value (0.958) was higher than 0.05, hence we fail to reject 
the null hypothesis concluding that there was no significant difference between CAD and PMS indicating an 
insignificant effect on the comfort assessment process.  
 
Conclusion  
Cushions, seat backs, armrests, headrests, and footrests are major parts of many seat designs that aim to provide more 
comfort to humans, but due to the frequent physical prototypes required to satisfy all customer needs the process of 
developing a new seat or modifying an existing one is an intricate, costly, and time-consuming task. In addition, 
measuring and evaluating comfort, particularly in the subjective area, is a difficult task for designers. 
 
This research proposes a system of seat comfort assessment that can replace the costly conventional comfort evaluation 
methods and expedite the design process with minimum consumption of resources by using CAD to model seats and 
human bodies with various anthropometric dimensions in different sitting postures and then detect the contact pressure 
using FEA, followed by a simple validation in the real-world utilizing pressure mapping. By varying the seat features 
and material of the cushion through built-in libraries in CAD, the system can explore different seat designs and propose 
the optimum combination for the best sitting comfort.  
 
Validations reveal a 98% correlation between the numerical and experimental techniques, broadening the comfort 
evaluation metrics and enhancing the efficiency of the design process. Using the proposed system, designers can 
simply test a variety of seat configurations virtually to find the best option for the diverse population of occupants 
they aim to satisfy in different industries without the need to build numerous prototypes and waste resources.  
This presented study was limited to the Asian-Indian population and analyzed seat comfort for two different cushion 
materials only. Future development of this work will consider a wider selection of cushion materials and study the 
influence of changing the parameters of seat features. The study shall also integrate human factors simulation to study 
the comfort of different human postures with respect to various seat designs. A motion capture system is to be used to 
validate the virtual environment by detecting the human body joints in diverse sitting postures and then assessing their 
posture comfort using a comfort assessment tool. This will pave the way for research on human factors simulation for 
assessing comfort of human body posture.

Abstract 
One of the 10 main most important decisions in operations management is where to locate the company. It is one of 
the most vital decisions any SMME or other company will ever make. The aim of this study is to examine the effect 
location decision has on manufacturing and service SMMEs’ business performance. This research conducted a 
qualitative study where 5 SMMEs owners/managers from the manufacturing and service sector were interviewed. The 
thematic analysis revealed a central theme that SMME owners face while deciding where to locate their business. 
Then, based on the interview, five themes were developed. Because of their previous experiences with location 
decisions, all five respondents are satisfied with their current business. This study is important because it contributes 
to the body knowledge of operations management. Future studies should conduct a similar study but with more 
respondents to identify new themes that might emerge.

Abstract 
Airports as major transportation hubs need to transport a large number of travelers every day. Effectively managing 
such a large transportation system without compromising safety has always been a huge challenge. One of the keys to 
enhancing overall airport management is improving operational efficiency, which includes optimizing the allocation 
and schedules of limited resources, such as workforce and equipment. This paper proposed a method for generating 
optimal job schedules for Ground Service Equipment and Ground Support Staff using a two-dimensional genetic 
algorithm and validating using discrete-event simulations. For the 2D-GA, the method for selecting the parents is the 
truncation based on a preset threshold, for crossover is both the horizontal and vertical swap by generating random 
exchange points, and for mutation is the random resetting. The iteration for generating new offspring, or new solutions, 
will stop once the stop condition is met which means the optimal solution(s) is found. This paper also presents the 
optimization of job scheduling using the two-dimensional genetic algorithm using real flight schedules from an airport. 
The schedule is generated in MATLAB and used as input to the Simio simulation model for validation.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, with the ever-closer international relations, the demand for travel is also increasing. Airports as the major 
transportation hubs need to transport a large number of travelers every day. For a large-scale airport, such as the 
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is the busiest airport in the world, annual passenger traffic 
could reach 110 million. Even under the influence of the Covid-19 in 2020, there were still more than 42 million 
passengers traveling through the Atlanta Airport.  
Ground service equipment (GSE) is an essential part to perform a turnaround in daily airport operations. GSE 
provides various types of services to aircraft between the flights. It is usually kept in the apron area near the 
terminal for better accessibility. Common tasks of GSE contain aircraft maintenance and cleaning, aircraft 
maneuvering and refueling, airfield maintenance, de-icing and snow removal, emergency response, moving 
payloads, and restocking of provisions (KB Environmental Sciences, Inc. 2015). Since there are many types of 
GSE, the make, model, and capabilities of each GSE type are not always the same. Additionally, the same type 
of GSE might be required at various locations as soon as there is a service request, which would likely be after 
the landing of an aircraft. Therefore, managing the GSE fleet is a complex task. From regular job dispatching to 
equipment maintenance scheduling, different types of GSE have different frequencies and requirements for 
routine tasks and equipment maintenance. One way to improve efficiency from the airside operations side is to 
reduce the turnaround time, which is the time that an aircraft takes from landing to taking off for a new flight. 
In an ideal situation, all GSE and GSS (Ground support staff) should be available right away at the requested 
location to have a minimal turnaround time. However, it is not always the case in the real world. In some cases, 
the ground support staff is unable to obtain real-time status and conditions of the GSE. As a result, unexpected 
failures can occur, causing an increase in the turnaround time.

dimensional genetic algorithm is feasible and does not cause delays for the upcoming flight. Therefore, the actual task 
durations from the simulation are compared with the estimated task durations.

5. Conclusion 
This paper presents the solution of joint job scheduling for the ground support equipment (GSE) and the ground service 
staff (GSS) using the two-dimensional Genetic Algorithm. Both the flow chart and the pseudocode of the 2D GA are 
provided. The required information, such as the flight engagement schedules and the preliminary resource planning, 
are also discussed in this paper. In summary, the method for selecting the parents is the truncation based on a preset 
threshold, for crossover is both the horizontal and vertical swap by generating random exchange points, and for 
mutation is the random resetting. The iteration for generating new offspring, or new solutions, will stop once the stop 
condition is met which means the optimal solution(s) is found. This paper also presents a case study of the optimization 
of job scheduling using the two-dimensional genetic algorithm using real flight schedules from the airport and 
simulation by a discrete-event simulation model. The schedule is generated in MATLAB and used as input to the 
Simio model. The simulation results also suggested that the optimized schedule is feasible. 
     
For limitations and future works, although the optimal job generation uses real flight schedules from the MDT airport, 
assumptions have been made on the type and duration of turnaround tasks and also the number of resources. For future 
work, real operational information can be used as input for job schedule generating. Furthermore, the 2D-GA presented 
in this thesis does not take into consideration the travel time between tasks and resource utilization. Future work can 
be done to improve the 2D-GA by evaluating the travel time and resource utilization and including those factors in 
the fitness calculation.

Abstract 
Green growth can be achieved through environmental sustainability which can be translated into workplace pro-
environmental behavior at the individual level. Workplace Pro-environmental behavior refers to a range of actions 
directed toward the environment that includes all forms of voluntary or prescribed activities performed by individuals 
at work to protect the natural environment or enhance organisational green practices. Therefore, necessary efforts in 
identifying the key determinants of pro-environmental behavior among Malaysian public servants should be taken to 
realize Malaysia’s green growth achievement since public servants are the largest workforce in Malaysia. Moreover, 
studies on pro-environmental behavior among the Malaysian public servant is still limited. Hence, this study aimed to 
explore the determinants that influence workplace pro-environmental behavior (WPEB) based on systematic literature 
review and preliminary study. A comprehensive systematic literature review has been conducted to identify articles 
that empirically examined the determinants of employee pro-environmental behavior through the trusted SCOPUS 
databases sources. Next, a preliminary study was done to further evaluate and rank the importance of each determinant 
obtained from the systematic literature review conducted earlier in this study. A total of five key figures were chosen 
to participate in the preliminary study based on their experience and expertise and they were requested to evaluate the 
importance of each determinant of WPEB based on the experience of WPEB in their workplace setting. Overall 
analysis results from the mean value obtained from the preliminary study showed two individual environmental 
concern and environmental harmonious show a high level of mean score of 4.80. Likewise, environmental 
transformational leadership and perceived organization support toward environment achieved the highest mean score 
of 4.80 collectively represented organisational determinants.

The key determinant influencing WPEB among Malaysian public servants were established through a combination of 
both systematic literature review (SLR) and preliminary interview data gathering. SLR has made exploration through 
literature from Malaysia and other countries to establish the key determinants of WPEB. Thus, preliminary interview 
with key figures was conducted to validate the findings from SLR. Overall analysis results from the frequency obtained 
from SLR and mean value obtained from the preliminary study showed environmental concern (EC) and

environmental harmonious passion (EHP) were found as a key individual determinant influencing WPEB. While 
perceived organization support toward environment (POSE), environment transformational leadership (ETL) and Co-
worker influence (CA) were discovered as key organizational determinants influencing WPEB. The environmental 
behavior of individual employees is shaped by the personality traits or individual characteristics. Personality traits or 
individual characteristics have long been recognized as a significant type of individual determinants that affects human 
behavior. Prior work had focused on the psychological mechanisms that account for the interconnections between 
personality traits, other individual characteristics, and behavior (Kim et al.  2014). Consequently, individual 
determinants which include personality traits and individual characteristics were demonstrated and confirmed 
significantly influence WPEB. Apart from the individual determinants, organizational contexts also stimulate 
employee behavior. This debate is supported by Zibarras & Coan (2015) who claimed that supportive decisions by 
the organization are a significant catalyst for employees to engage in green behavior at work. Recent study by  Yusop 
& Adam (2021) claimed numerous research has been empirically verified and proven about the importance of 
organizational-related variables as determinants of employee PEB in the workplace setting.

Abstract 
Due to the need for rural electrification, recent studies on the optimization of HRES has been conducted extensively 
to improve the planning process before microgrid implementation. Improvement in recent literature and practice have 
enabled new systems of storage to store energies as chemicals that would not be affected by the self-discharge rate, 
among others, of battery energy systems, albeit having its own disadvantages. Hence, this paper seeks to determine 
the applicability of an HRES system to consider these two types of storages and how a choice between the two can be 
made. With this goal, a mixed-integer linear programming model was formulated that aims to minimize the economic 
costs of an HRES microgrid implementation of a SPV/WTG/diesel system with battery and ammonia storage systems. 
The model would identify the number of each component to be installed as well as their sizes for SPV and WTG, 
being area and height, respectively. Since ammonia is a chemical that can be sold as fertilizer or fuel to bolster the 
economic viability of the system, the amount of energy needed to produce this chemical and to be sold was also 
determined. Moreover, the distribution of electricity from each source towards the demand loads would be determined 
to yield insights on the amount and proportion of energies generated, stored, and used throughout the planning horizon. 
Through this model, this paper has successfully formulated a model that provides decision support on several possible 
configurations of HRES microgrids to aid in its future developments.

1. Introduction
1.1. Rural Electrification 
It is universally agreed that energy is essential towards the survival of society. Energy not only provides the means 
for production and transportation necessary to maintain living conditions, but it also enables the community to develop 
such that the technological benefits of modern medicine and societal improvement in household tasks and water 
quality can be enjoyed (Jiménez et al. 2017). However, due to energy production facilities being centralized, 
communities that are situated to be very far from these areas would incur large amounts of transmission costs due to 
the need for power line construction. Hence, access to sufficient energy to support daily activities and community 
improvement becomes a challenge for remote areas. Fortunately, technologies have been developed to circumvent the 
need for the energy supply of these places to be solely reliant on these centralized facilities. This type of system is 
known as a microgrid, which produces and supplies energy that is necessary for a smaller region. With this 
development, there have been several variations in the implementation of these systems. The energy production could

Figure 4. Percent Contribution of Energies Delivered from Each Battery 
 
From these proportions, it can be determined that the following shows how the energies of each battery were 
distributed to each demand point. Likewise, future improvements on analysis could be conducted based on certain 
qualities of demand points and deliveries such as having delivery charges costing differently for each demand point 
being considered.

6. Conclusion 
Ultimately, through this endeavor, the study is believed to have successfully formulated and analyzed a hybrid 
renewable microgrid system using linear programming. It can be observed that the results are not intuitive for the 
microgrid planner, and quantitative methods like the one used in this paper can ease the problem of production and 
distribution of energies from the source to storage devices up until their respective demand points. Furthermore, by 
having considered newer technologies such as the ammonia storage system in its design, this paper has provided room 
for ideas on future microgrid implementation.

Abstract 
In this paper, a fleet dispatching system is proposed. The system is able to aquiring data like truck weight, traffic 
condition, and driver’s habit, and then use to Modified Fuel Considered Consumption Rate Considered Vehicle 
Routing Problem (MFCVRP) for route planning of the fleet. Doesn’t like the traditional Capacitated Vehicle Routing 
Proble(CVRP), the MFCVRP considered more factors so it will provides a more efficient route planning in practice. 
A simulation is done to compare the MFCVRP and the CVRP to verify the advantage of the new model.

1. Introduction
Freight transport by trucks is one of the most common methods of transporting goods around the world. In addition, 
Covid-19 made people more willing to shop online, and services like one-day delivery are much more popular than 
before. However, unlike trains, ships, or aircraft. The transporting conditions for trucks are much more complex than 
the rest methods. The trucks are sharing the same road with millions of passenger cars as well as other commercial 
vehicles. Hence, more factors need to be considered to deliver goods on time than the rest of the methods. To solve 
such a problem, a better fleet management strategy is necessary. 
One of the most critical aspects of fleet management is route planning for each truck. The goal of this planning problem 
is to find the most efficient way of dispatching tasks to each individual of the fleet. Usually, there are multiple 
destinations to visit each day. All with different distances, road conditions, and traffic conditions. They are 
dynamically changed all the time. 
There are several constraints to this problem. For instance, the time that truck drivers spend on the road each day is 
limited to ensure safety. And the longest distance that a truck can go (range) without refilling is also limited. The 
second constraint is especially important as the current trend of vehicle’s drivetrain is moving from internal 
combustion engine to fully electric. And an electric vehicle usually takes hours to do fully recharged.

6. Conclusion
The universal truck fleet dispatching system is proposed and be preliminary designed. It contains two parts, the 
onboard data acquisition / processing system obtains the truck weight, traffic condition, driver’s driving habit, and 
other data to estimate the range of the truck. This information is sent to the cloud-based dispatching system to assign 
the optimized tasks to each individual truck in the fleet. And then naturally, the operation efficiency of the whole fleet 
will be increased. 
This simulation proofs that the minimal traveling distance covered by the fleet does not always mean the minimal cost 
in the real world because there are a lot more factors that affect the cost other than distance. Considering and bringing 
in more factors usually can lead to a more accurate result. In this simulation specifically, traffic condition and fuel 
consumption were considered in addition to the distance. However, there are still a few things that can be improved 
in the future. 1) There are still some data left unused from the data acquisition subsystem like the driver’s driving 
style, dynamically changed traffic condition, and time window constraints. 2) Consumer location can be modeled 
based on the real-world map. 3) Parameters need to be fine-tuned to better represent the real word situation. 4) Better 
and more suitable solver or solving methods should be further researched.

Abstract 
With a high population density in Metro Manila, and having most of the workforce traveling in and out of the Metro, 
many transport methods are used to accommodate the commuters. The UV Express vans are one of the most common 
modes of transportation in the Philippines, 18-seater vans are commonly used for the UV-Express. Due to its 
popularity, makeshift seats are used to fit more passengers and have 4 passengers per row. This leads to comfortability 
problems as the passengers fit in a small space. The study was conducted to determine if the current measurements 
and number of passengers of the vans are suitable for public transport. The study focuses on the 18-seater vans which 
are the Hi-ace fifth-generation vans. Using statistical analysis such as regression, the determinants that affect the 
overall comfortability of the passengers were determined. The recommended improvements were proposed using 
relevant design tools. This can be concluded that the current measurements of the UV-Express vans are not suited to 
the current number of passengers since the seat width are not enough to fit four in a row and the actual measurement 
for leg space are below the recommended measurement for the leg space.

1. Introduction
Urban transportation is important to maintain the daily lives of urban residents and the economic development of a 
country (Tao et al., 2019). Having a good transportation system is vital since it transports the workforce which is vital 
for the economy. The Philippines' transportation system is ranked among the worst in Southeast Asia. Metro Manila 
is the location of central business districts and educational institutions where employees and students travel every day. 
Many of these commuters reside outside Metro Manila and use various means of transportation to get through their 
day. Common means of transportation include buses, public utility Jeepneys, rail systems, and UV express service. 
UV express service is one of the most popular forms of transportation since it provides point-to-point service (Asinas 
et al. 2017). Due to its popularity, the number of vans in transit is insufficient to meet the demand of commuters, 
leading to the vans' exceeding their maximum capacity in exchange for the passengers' seating 
comfortability. Overcrowding occurs when something is filled beyond what is usual and comfortable (Varghese & 
Adhvaryu 2016). Due to the demand for the UV Express, drivers add makeshift seats to fit more passengers in one 
trip. Manufacturers of cars consider the ergonomics in their design. This includes the seats and dashboard displays 
that can affect the comfortability of the user (Abidi et al. 2013). By adding the makeshift seats, the 
designed ergonomics of the manufacturer are sidelined leading to a more crowded and less comfortable experience 
for the commuters.  
There were only a few research studies about the UV Express service. Although there were existing studies about the 
comfortability of passengers, there was no previous study on the comfortability of passengers specifically for UV 
Express. This drives the author to pursue a study that will focus on the passenger's comfortability availing of UV 
Express services. The findings of the study will benefit society, especially the regular commuters of the UV Express 
vans. The results of the study can improve the current service provided by the UV Express vans and can provide 
contributions to general public transportation.  Furthermore, the findings of the study can improve and increase the 
level of comfortability of commuters in the Philippines. Other transportation means that use vans were not considered

6. Recommendation 
To further improve the current study, the researcher recommends having a separate study in terms of the overall 
comfortability of the UV-Express vans to be able to determine the factors that affect the passengers the most in terms 
of comfortability of the UV Express vans. These factors should consider vibration, noise, thermal comfort, and other 
factors that could determine the overall comfortability of the passengers. Since many factors also can affect the 
comfortability of the vans. It can also be concluded that most of the determinants used in the study were not statistically 
significant which reflects in the value of the overall rating model using regression analysis. This means that a further 
study on the determinants could give a significant effect on the model and include other indicators that will have 
significant contributors to the results of the model. Future studies should also consider seat cushions. The materials 
used or if the material is breathable or if the material is dense to further expand the comfortability of the seats in terms 
of the seat cushion. The researcher also recommends looking into the compatibility of the currently recommended 
improvements if it is suited for use of the UV Express vans.

Abstract 
In encouraging new business ideas to students who are members of the business incubator, new methods are needed 
to help stimulate them to get ideas. In this case, an experiment was conducted on students using a digital museum to 
spark new ideas and innovate. The aim is to provide an idea of whether this experiment is successful or not if it is used 
as a new method of mentoring in the business incubator. The data is processed from 73 respondents of business 
students who are currently undergoing activities at the Business Incubator, at a private university, Bandung, Indonesia. 
The survey was conducted online through an open-ended question survey. Data analysis was performed using first-
cycle coding, second-cycle coding and cross tab analysis. The results of the research show that digital museums can 
provide inspiration for business ideas. There are various museums with a variety of inspirations obtained by students. 
These results show that in the midst of a pandemic, mentoring and coaching processes can still be carried out to help 
stimulate new ideas from students. The uniqueness of this research is to try new ways in the mentoring process in 
business incubators for business development. The benefits of this research academically can develop knowledge in 
the realm of business incubators, and practically assist facilitators in developing new ways of mentoring.

Abstract 
The Business Incubator aims to assist businesses under its auspices in order to increase their growth and business 
scale. The start-up era has an impact on the business landscape, which initially obtained capital conventionally, now 
pursues funding from venture capital. The purpose of this research is to see whether their business students want to 
run a business that grows organically or being invested. The survey was conducted on 448 students who were divided 
into 3 batches. The survey was conducted online, using open-ended questions. The results of the study show, with a 
value above 70%, the entire generation chooses to develop their business organically because they want to develop 
independently and without interference from investors. The rest are willing to scale their business with the help of 
investors. This research is useful for the business incubator team to place every business they supervise to get a 
companion and facilities that are in accordance with the wishes of the student so that his business can develop.

Abstract 
Entrepreneurship education is aims to facilitate students to be able to develop their business. One of the activities 
carried out in the business incubator is coaching. In addition to face-to-face coaching, there is also a self-coaching 
online form provided to help students explore their potential. This study uses a qualitative approach, with research 
participants as many as 73 business students from a private university in the city of Bandung. The study used an open-
ended question survey, which was distributed online. Data analysis used qualitative data analysis with cross tab 
analysis results. The results of the study show that the inspiration from the website has succeeded in giving birth to 
new ideas for business development. Participants choose from the same industry as well as different from their 
business, then put that inspiration into their business and plan new products or services to improve existing ones. This 
research is useful for mentors, coaches, and facilitators in business incubators to use this model to make it easier for 
business students to explore new ideas in a patterned manner. This research is limited because it only uses one 
trendhunter website and was tried by business incubator participants. It is necessary to develop sources of ideas and 
other research participants who are also undergoing entrepreneurship education.

Abstract 
Entrepreneurship education pursued by universities is an effort to create entrepreneurs who can build the country. 
Now, various fields are developing and involving technology in the process to make it more effective and efficient. 
Not to forget, the agricultural sector is also a major concern, because in Indonesia there are not many start-ups in the 
agricultural sector and agriculture is a field that is one of the main needs and a leading sector for Indonesia. The 
purpose of this study was to determine whether agricultural students have the desire to become entrepreneurs after 
seeing start-ups engaged in agriculture have begun to appear in Indonesia. This study uses a qualitative approach. Data 
were collected from 44 agricultural students at a private university, in the city of Bandung, through an online survey, 
open-ended question. Data analysis in this study uses qualitative data analysis software to make cross tab analysis. 
The results of the study show that there is interest after seeing start-ups in the agricultural sector. With the same field, 
students want to start a business with the help of technology, and want to develop agricultural potential in Indonesia. 
Research is useful for universities to know that the existence of start-ups encourages the desire of students to build a 
business after graduating from college. The limitation of this research is that the research object only takes data from 
one university that provides agriculture.

1. Introduction
In Indonesia, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises play an important role in the Indonesian economy. It is proven 
by the contribution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 61.97 percent of the total national GDP or equivalent to Rp. 
8,500 trillion in 2020, and absorb labor in the amount of 97 percent of the absorption of the business world in 2020, 
so it can be said that small business has an important role in the absorption of labor in Indonesia (BPKM 2021). In 
2016 there were 61.7 million small business and continued to increase until in 2018 small business in Indonesia 
reached 64.2 million and are predicted to continue to increase (data tempo 2021). However, in early 2020, the COVID-
19 virus emerged which had a major impact on small business and threatened to go bankrupt. The general chairman 
of the Indonesian small business association, Ikhsan Ingratubun said that there were 30 million small business that 
had gone bankrupt out of a total of 63 million small business due to decreased turnover so they could not hire their 
employees. With the emergence of these problems, the government provides many assistance programs for small 
business so that they can continue to grow during the pandemic and continue to contribute to National GDP. This 
government program is also supported by many parties, including the private sector and also educational institutions

While the mediation between independent variable and dependent variable can be seen through Figure 2. Using 
Sobel Test to calculate the significant between Entrepreneurial Intention and Entrepreneurship education with 
Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy. The Sobel Test value is 12.327 bigger than the t table with value 1.96. The significant 
value is 0.000 smaller than 0.05. Thus, Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy mediates the relationship between 
Entrepreneurship Education and Entrepreneurial Intention. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Result of Sobel Test 
 
Based on the processed data above, all hypotheses are accepted. It can be said that Entrepreneurship Education, 
Entrepreneur Intention and Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy influence each other. As the results presented by Puni et al 
(2018), research is still needed to measure how much influence is generated between variables. To calculate the 
magnitude of the effect using the effective contribution and the relative contribution. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Entrepreneurship education has been applied to senior high school students in the Probolinggo city, it is necessary to 
see how the influence they received from entrepreneurship education that they got to their entrepreneurial intentions. 
The results of the study state that Entrepreneurship Education has significant positive to Entrepreneurial Intention, 
Entrepreneurship Education also has significant positive to Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy, Entrepreneurial Intention 
has significant positive to Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy. Measured using the Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy as 
mediation, the results show that Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy mediate the influence between Entrepreneurship 
Education and Entrepreneurial Intention. This study expected to help high school teachers in the Probolinggo city to 
develop students' entrepreneurial intentions.

Abstract 
Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild plant and animal species. Wildlife plays a vital role in balancing 
the ecosystem and stabilizing different natural processes.  In order to enable real-time tracking and monitoring of 
animal movements, different tracking devices can be used. A collaboration work with a telecommunication industrial 
partner in senior capstone design projects considers enhancing animal tracking devices. In this work, IoT-based 
tracking device is designed to be powered from animal’s motion by using build-in harvesting unit. The device will be 
used to monitor and track animal’s motions as well as biological signals such as temperature, pressure and heart rates 
in order to observe and study animal species in their natural habitat.

1. Introduction
Internet of things (IoT) platform provides huge collection of data that can be used in research and supervision 
applications (Bahga & Madisetti  2015; Kranz  2016; Acharjya & Geetha  2017).  IoT is a system of interrelated 
diverse subsystems such as computing devices, machines, objects, animals and people that are uniquely identified. 
These subsystems have the ability to transfer data over the global Internet without the need of human-to-human or 
human-to-computer interaction. 
Energy harvesting is the process of deriving energy from external ambient sources such as solar energy, wind energy, 
thermal energy, RF radiation and vibrations. Commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) energy harvesters provide a very 
small amount of power that can be used for applications that require low-energy electronics. Recently, there has been 
an increase interest in harvesting energy from natural resources to power up IoT devices and allow longer periods of 
operation while sending high rate of data (Bizon et al.  2017; Chen  2019). 
Technology noticeably contributed in tracking animals’ movement.   Detail spatial and temporal data are collected 
and used in animal conversation (Katzner & Arlettaz  2020).  A study conducted by Lei et al. (2019) targeted five 
geese species including birds’ migratory using Satellite tracking devices.   The solar-powered global system for mobile 
communication (GSM) transmitter has an integrated general packet radio service (GPRS) subsystem for short message

Passing through all of these experiments leads the team forward to have a better understanding of the application of 
the project and how to harvest the maximum energy from animal motion and vibration. Also, the experiments reflect 
the need to develop a robust prototype that tolerates rough operation conditions.  
 
 
Figure 6. The developed prototype (right) and the prototype on an animal for testing (left). 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
During the assembly and testing process, there were many difficulties until reaching to the desired output. For 
example, the software program has been modified several times in order to allow the OLED to display the changing 
generated voltage by the piezoelectric energy harvester. Another challenge was to find an efficient method to cause 
the harvester to vibrate by the animal's motion which is an essential task in the energy harvesting process. Several 
methods were proposed but finally the team came up with the idea of placing the piezoelectric on a bell with a weight 
(small metallic ball) and connect it to the pins of the energy harvester through flexible wires and then to the circuit 
board, see Figure 6. The results obtained from testing the prototype show that an enough harvested voltage of 3 volts 
can be produced from the energy harvester in order to operate the ESP8266 for sending the animal location as shown 
in Figure 5. 
 
In future, in addition to the GPS module, additional sensors to the device can be added in order to expand the study 
on the animals and get more information. For example, if a heartbeat sensor is added to measure the heartbeat of the 
animal, observers can know that something happened to the animal if the heart rate changed. Furthermore, adding 
more piezoelectric energy harvesters can be used to increase the charging voltage so the whole device can be charged 
using the harvesting unit only. A multiple piezoelectric energy harvesters will enable the device to conduct more 
information using different sensors types or send information to the observer multiple times a day rather than once for 
example. 
 
4. Conclusion 
IoT can be utilized in wildlife conservation to track animal migration, especially for endangered animals.  With IoT, 
data can be gathered, stored, and analyzed. The generated reports from these databases can be used to keep track of 
animals’ migrations as well as animals’ behaviors. In this work, the authors came up with a lightweight IoT tracking 
device for animals that can be operated in a very demanding and versatile environment. The reliable lightweight IoT 
tracking device operates under different weather conditions and requires little maintenance after long time usage.  The 
special embedded energy harvesting unit converts animal motion into energy.  This contributes to extending the life 
of the battery used to operate the tracking device and extending the operation of the device to continue gathering GPS 
information.  Moreover, the GPS unit in the circuit adds an option to track animals’ locations and send gathered data 
to an IoT cloud using the ESP8266 controller.  The IoT device is tested on cats and dogs, however, different animal 
species can also be used to test the device and to generalize the research findings.

1. Introduction
In Indonesia, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises play an important role in the Indonesian economy. It is proven 
by the contribution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 61.97 percent of the total national GDP or equivalent to Rp. 
8,500 trillion in 2020, and absorb labor in the amount of 97 percent of the absorption of the business world in 2020, 
so it can be said that small business has an important role in the absorption of labor in Indonesia (BPKM 2021). In 
2016 there were 61.7 million small businesses and continued to increase until in 2018 small business in Indonesia 
reached 64.2 million and are predicted to continue to increase (data tempo 2021). However, in early 2020, the COVID-
19 virus emerged which had a major impact on small business and threatened to go bankrupt. The general chairman 
of the Indonesian small business association, Ikhsan Ingratubun said that there were 30 million small business that 
had gone bankrupt out of a total of 63 million small business due to decreased turnover so they could not hire their 
employees. With the emergence of these problems, the government provides many assistance programs for small 
business so that they can continue to grow during the pandemic and continue to contribute to National GDP. These 
government programs are also supported by many parties, including the private sector and also educational institutions

6. Conclusion
Entrepreneurship education has been applied to senior high school students in the Probolinggo city, it is necessary to 
see how the influence they received from entrepreneurship education that they got to their entrepreneurial intentions. 
The results of the study state that Entrepreneurship Education has significant positive impact to Entrepreneurial 
Intention, Entrepreneurship Education also has significant positive impact to Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy, 
Entrepreneurial Intention has significant positive impact to Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy. Measured using the 
Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy as mediation, the results show that Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy mediate the influence 
between Entrepreneurship Education and Entrepreneurial Intention. In conclusion, all variables in this study are has 
significant impact toward each other and the data shown that all hypotheses are proven. We expect this study to help 
high school teachers in the Probolinggo city to develop students' entrepreneurial intentions. Future researchers are 
expected to be able to use different mediating variables and expand the research by calculating the amount produced 
by each variable that affects each other.

Abstract 
Ethnic and gender diversity is purported to be critical for innovation success, yet scant empirical evidence exists to 
support this claim. Surveys of executive perceptions, simulations under controlled conditions and field research 
through proxy metrics point to a positive relationship between diversity and innovation but suffer from significant 
limitations. The paucity of data-driven studies on the linkage between diversity and innovation is due to the fact that 
innovators are almost invisible in innovation research, in sharp contrast to entrepreneurs who figure prominently in 
entrepreneurship studies. The objective of this paper is to examine the issue of gender in innovation through an analysis 
of patent application data from geographical regions with intense innovative activity. (The issue of ethnicity is difficult 
to approach with publicly available data.) Patent application data are a direct -although not fully complete- metric of 
innovation output as they (mostly) capture technological innovations. A comprehensive analysis of the 31 top 
innovation hotspots in the US reveals that the percentage of women innovators is weakly correlated with the total 
patent output of innovation hotspots. While the correlation does not appear to be statistically significant, further 
equivalency tests suggests that the admittedly small effect is not negligible. The results of this exploratory study thus 
set the stage for a more comprehensive one that will have to be designed with a richer set of data.

1. Introduction
The process of innovation evolves through several phases, such as identifying opportunities, screening ideas, testing 
concepts, developing products and services, and finally bringing them to the marketplace. The ever-present pressure 
to accelerate time-to-market means that there is always phase-overlapping in the innovation process and cross-
functional teams must always work in tandem. The complexity of the information flows involved as well as the 
diversity of knowledge represented in the creative teams, requires sophisticated management skills (Anderson et al., 
2014). Indeed, value creation in new product and service development is almost exclusively based on the effective 
management of knowledge and of the social dynamics of the innovative teams (Mueller-Seeger 2015; Tsakalerou 
2016). 
The study of creativity and innovation has occupied a broad spectrum of experts across the fields of behavioral science, 
human cognition, and organizational behavior. In recent years, diversity has emerged as a factor of interest in the 
innovation process (Massaro et al.  2015). After years of incentives and targeted initiatives to increase diversity in 
organizations, there is some empirical evidence from a range of industries around the world that diversity produces 
better outcomes. Specifically, it appears that the financial performance of firms with greater gender and ethnic 
diversity in their corporate leadership significantly exceeds that of their respective national industry medians (Hunt et 
al.  2015). 
While there is a broad agreement that diversity improves financial performance, there are very few papers in the 
literature examining the link between diversity and innovation performance. An early experiment in a controlled 
setting demonstrated that a problem-solving team with members randomly selected from a diverse population of 
intelligent agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing agents (Hong & Page  2004). A later 
simulation in a controlled setting demonstrated that while there is little correlation between a group’s collective

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The ambiguity of the non-significant result obtained maybe ameliorated by performing an equivalence test (Lakens et 
al., 2018). The test cannot verify that there is no effect, but it can reveal whether such an effect, if it exists, is likely to 
be of negligible practical significance. In this context, two one-sided tests (TOST) are performed to further investigate 
the weak correlation between WI and PCT. 
To decide whether the effect can be neglected or not one sets the equivalence bounds based on the smallest effect size 
of interest (SESOI). Then, if the effect of the given sample is smaller than SESOI it is considered as equivalent to 
zero. The smallest effect size is obtained from the power analysis of the sample, which includes 31 observations in 
this case.  Table 5 presents the correlation coefficients and their significance from the TOST analysis.  
Table 5. TOST Correlation

0.472 
 
 
TOST Upper 
0.134 
0.178 
 
 
TOST Lower 
0.134 
0.009 
Apart from the Pearson’s correlation already calculated in Table 4, it includes two tests across the upper and lower 
equivalence bounds. As a result of the first one, the correlation of WI-PCT is significantly higher than the lower band 
(p=0.009), whereas the correlation from the second test is not significantly lower than the upper bound (p=0.178). It 
means that one cannot reject the PCT-WI correlation at least at one of the extremes (Lakens et al.  2018).  
This outcome motivates further study of the issue with the proposed improvements targeting the increase of the size 
of the sample to empower its interpretive power. 
6. Conclusion  
Innovative businesses thrive by anticipating market trends and needs and responding in fashion with improved 
products or brand-new ones that meet and exceed customer expectations. Creating business growth through innovation 
is considered the most important business challenge today. In fact, in modern manufacturing intangible assets like 
inventions, designs and specialist knowledge are worth nearly twice as much as tangible assets such as raw materials 
(WIPO  2018). 
 
Putting together an innovation team is the most challenging job for an organization, but one that is often conducted in 
an ad hoc manner. Individual innovator profiling is still a puzzling issue in innovation, but gender diversity is certainly 
a desirable team characteristic. Yet women inventors are strongly under-represented in almost every country around 
the world. 
 
Recent research has focused on the challenges facing women in the IP system (Cutura  2019) and the policy 
interventions needed to close the gender gap (Brant et al.  2019). The consensus in the literature is that the 
underrepresentation of women in the IP system is due to reasons such as the lack of access to financial and knowledge 
resources; the lack of understanding of the value of IP rights; the limited exposure to female inventor role models; and 
the broad discriminatory socio-cultural norms and expectations. Further, the limited availability of gender-sensitive 
data in innovation, limits the ability of policy makers to develop and implement data-driven initiatives. In addition, 
the limited availability of sex-disaggregated data and other gender-sensitive indicators hampers the ability of policy 
makers and IP practitioners to better understand the breadth and depth of the IP gender gap. 
 
The exploratory study in this paper is an attempt to help in this direction. The results demonstrate that adding a gender 
perspective to the innovation milieu is directly related to innovation performance as measured by patent applications. 
The quite modest effect observed requires further study with an expanded dataset. 
There are two caveats in interpreting the results of this paper. First, the analysis concentrated on the innovation 
hotspots of the US, and the outcomes might be varied in different countries and cultures. Second, the use of patent 
filings as a proxy of innovation performance does not capture innovative activities that lead to journal publications 
and not necessarily patents (Shah, 2019).

Abstract 
PT. X Start-up Company, a company that has many employees, the data found that the turnover rate in that company 
has increased, especially in the risk division. The research is intended to answer research questions, how the influence 
of career development and job satisfaction on employee engagement of the risk division of the start-up company PT. 
X. This study uses quantitative research methods through a descriptive approach. The number of samples used in this
study were all employees of the risk division of the start-up company PT. X which amounted to as many as 80 people.
Data collected by using a questionnaire in the form of a list of questions. The data analysis technique used is Path
Analysis. The results research show that career development and job satisfaction either partially or simultaneously
have a significant effect on employee engagement in the risk division of the start-up company PT. X. The large
contribution of career development and job satisfaction to employee engagement of the risk division employees at the
start-up company PT. X is 63.6% and the remaining 36.4% is influenced by other variables not included in this study.

1. Introduction
The success of a start-up depends on the experience of the founders and the holistic dimensions of product, finance, 
market, and human resources (Klotins et al. 2016). The initial stage for any start-up is usually influenced by the 
experience of the founders. However, for the long term, strategic and human resource management is important for 
every start-up (Newbery  2018). Therefore, developing an effective strategy is very important to create a sustainable 
work environment which will further encourage the growth of start-ups (Bendickson et al. 2017). 
In a case study that occurred at the start-up company PT. X, by taking data from one of the divisions of the company, 
the fact found is that employee engagement in that division of the company is relatively low, this is indicated by the 
high turnover in that division of the company. Rachman and Dewanto (2016) explained that the results of the study 
showed that employee engagement had an effect on employee turnover intention. 
Mitrovska and Eftimov (2016) mentionedd the turnover rate is indicated by the LTO (Labor Turnover Rate) which 
can be measured. The LTO rate calculates the turnover rate that occurs in a company in the span of one year. Susanti

the dimensions of vigor, dedication, and absorption. Therefore, a good assessment can be interpreted that all these 
dimensions and the indicators in them can be implemented as well as possible except for the serious indicator, the 
indicator of enjoying work, and the indicator of concentration which still require attention from the company to be 
improved. Rey and Bastons (2018), startup companies are companies that operate in a very dynamic business 
environment, and managing their employees with various employee engagement programs will be beneficial for the 
company. Employee Engagement manages employees by involving employees physically, cognitively and 
emotionally, therefore employee engagement programs for startup companies are very necessary and can also improve 
performance and make employees more engaged and enjoy work, besides that it can also keep employees in the 
company (Moser et al.  2017). 
 
Based on the results of data analysis, career development variables have a positive and significant effect on employee 
engagement in the risk division employees at the start-up company PT. X. This result is indicated by a positive t-count 
value of 2.337 with a significance value of 0.022 <0.05. This positive influence means that the better career 
development applied to the risk division at the start-up company PT. X, it will increase employee engagement. When 
employees feel they are treated well by the company in career development, employees will be loyal and have a strong 
attachment to the company. Based on the results of data analysis, the variable job satisfaction has a positive and 
significant impact on employee engagement in the risk division of employees at the start-up company PT. X. This 
result is indicated by a positive t-count value of 2.984 with a significance value of 0.004 <0.05. This positive influence 
means the better job satisfaction felt by employees of the risk division at the start-up company PT. X, it will increase 
employee engagement. Based on the results of data analysis, career development and job satisfaction variables 
simultaneously have a significant effect on employees of the risk division at the start-up company PT. X. The results 
are indicated by the F-count value of 67.271 with a significance value of 0.000. With F-count (67.271) > F-table (3.12) 
and a significance value of 0.000 <0.05. In addition, the large contribution of career development and job satisfaction 
to employee engagement in the risk division of employees at the start-up company PT. X is 63.6% and the remaining 
36.4% is influenced by other variables not included in this study. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Career development of risk division employees at PT. X is in the good category. This is evidenced by the average 
value of respondents' responses obtained from 14 statement items regarding career development, which is 72.6% of 
the ideal score of 5,600. Job satisfaction of employees in the risk division at the start-up company PT. X is in the good 
category. This is evidenced by the average value of respondents' responses obtained from 22 statement items regarding 
career development, which is 73.0% of the ideal score of 8,800. Employee engagement of risk division employees at 
the start-up company PT. X is in the good category. This is evidenced by the average value of respondents' responses 
obtained from 20 statement items regarding career development, which is 78.8% of the ideal score of 8,000. The 
results of hypothesis testing prove that career development and job satisfaction, either partially or simultaneously, 
have a significant effect on employee engagement in the risk division of the start-up company PT. X.

Abstract 
All organizations need results to survive and, technology, because of its possible benefits, becomes something 
attractive to try to achieve ""such"" results. However, technology without qualified personnel to use it, does not bring 
the intended advantage. There is therefore a clear need to develop employees with the aim of being able to fulfill the 
requirements of the ""new"" roles. In addition to competence, employee involvement also has positive impacts on 
organizational results. Career plans, are good engagement promoters and can also promote a more capable workforce. 
Thus, the main objective of this paper is to propose the concept of a tool that can facilitate the management of the 
individual development plans. This study was conducted with the following methodology: a literature review, in the 
first phase, and 9 semi-structured interviews in the second phase. Therefore, a concept of a tool emerged that not only 
helps people to develop individually, but also the collective. Inherent to this artifact are different concepts such as: 
data visualization with Lean tools, to help in the decisions and in the visualizations of the goals' status and coaching 
tools to help the person's positioning and facilitate the detailing of the next steps at the career level. In this way, it is 
believed that this tool can impact very positively on the workforces of the future, making them more ready for the 
challenges that the industrial context poses.

1. Introduction
The industry 4.0 represents a significant opportunity to improved performance and strategic value creation. These 
changes present enormous opportunities for innovative businesses, but they may also pose a serious threat to 
businesses that do not respond quickly and effectively to current changes (Stachová et al.  2019). This growing

This study contained essentially two sources of information for the elaboration of the concept, the literature review, 
and interviews with people from the industrial environment. A limitation of this study is that the interviews were 
carried out only in two organizations, which can make the interpretations of the interviews biased. Future work will 
be based on programming the platform and testing it in a real environment, with people from different hierarchical 
levels, to understand if it meets the purpose, if the formulated requirements are sufficient and the 
interactivity/usefulness of the interface.

Abstract 
The focus of this research is to describe the conceptual analysis of the employee-people brand community theory on 
millennial workers towards the company's internal branding, which is the new theory of brand community related to 
the employee, to complete the previous theories about internal branding. The strategy of employee-people brand 
community has been well-known used in digital start-up companies (offline and online events). However, there is no 
existing literature discussing this strategy's concept. This strategy discussed in this paper can overcome the gap in 
academic research on brand community theory. The research method of this paper is a comparative research method 
by doing a literature review of brand management and brand community theories and observing the implementation 
of brand community strategy as the practical approach. This study reveals the basic concept of employee-people brand 
community theory, including the flowchart, characteristics, elements, and goals of this strategy.   
Keywords

1. Introduction
Huselid, Jackson, and Schuler (1997) said that the importance of human resource management in improving the 
effectiveness of the positive work condition could affect the productivity of the company, the company's financial 
performance, and the company's stock in market value. In addition, according to (Gratton, 1998; Hamed & Prahalad, 
1994), human resource management can also improve a company's competency in terms of competitive advantage 
that can differentiate the company from the competitors. This competitive advantage can be achieved by attracting 
employees through training and development, as well as providing the appropriate compensation to the employees 
(Jeanquart  2014). This process shows how important human resource management is within the company. 
One of the company's strategies to improve its competitive advantage is to use the brand to offer the product identity 
that distinguishes it from competitors' products. A brand is generally set up in a few words, designs, or particular 
symbols. A good image of a brand product or company has a good impact that can be beneficial for the company, 
while a negative image would hurt the company's good name. For decades, many companies have invested heavily in 
marketing efforts to build a good brand for customers or external companies to target more customers or 
stakeholders (Dechawatanapaisal  2019). As a result, many companies failed to consider the employee's role in 
realizing the company's brand strategy more deeply. This shows us that a brand must describe the connection between 
the company and employees and between the company and customers (Malanda & Ndubisi  2013).

Abstract 
This article presents a workflow to solve multi-contradiction problems for natural processes, in an eco-friendly way, 
using the Eco-innovation Elements and TRIZ (the theory of inventive problem solving). 
The suggested workflow is based on a mixture of the most popular TRIZ tools and the elements of Eco-innovation, it 
starts with a problem context analysis and scope definition, and it ends with a sequential brainstorming and evaluation 
of the solutions. The Ideal Final Result (IFR) tool is used as a comparison element to assess the solution. The method 
handles all the contradictions in a prioritized way, giving more chances for the solution to converge toward the IFR. 
The method aims to bypass contradictions instead of finding consensus. Indeed, as it is described, the workflow brings 
systematic step-by-step procedures to solve complex problems and differs from other toolsets that leave the choice to 
the solver’s convenience.

Optimization opportunities: with critical eyes the process analysis should disclose multiple pain points or optimization 
opportunities, this step is where these opportunities are listed and will be filtered out in the next step, with respect to 
the earlier defined scope. 
 
Problem formulation: a series of questioning whether the opportunity is related to the predefined scope is conducted, 
from the filtered opportunities, conflicting sentences are listed. It represents the contradictions needed to be solved. 
The steps model the problem, with a set harmful action formulated with sentences containing implicitly or explicitly 
contradictions. In the same step, and with the listed contradictions we can formulate our Ideal Final Result (IFR), 
which is the Ideal solution to our problem using no resources and having no harmful impact. This result will be the 
metric to our solutions, the closest to the IFR the better. 
 
The outcome of this phase is to be able to imagine an IFR and have a set of sentences relative to the real problem 
containing contradictions. The preprocessing is a preparatory phase and doesn’t consider the eco-innovation Elements. 
This way the solver is sure of formulating a constraint free IFR. 
We start with a real-world problem, and we end up with a list of generic contradictions, this constitutes the preparatory 
step to the abstraction transformation needed to use TRIZ tools. 
 
The processing phase is where a translation from the specific problem is undertaken (Gadd 2011), (Ilevbare et al. 
2013). We move the problem from the specific problem field to the generic solution field Figure. 1. The outcome of 
this phase is a set of Inventive Principles (IP). Combining the knowledge base to the selected IP constitute the generic 
solution field. 
This phase is a set of three steps: 
Eco-Innovation elements: The harmful actions formulated as series of contradictions (Phase I), will be categorized in 
one or more of the seven categories of the Eco-Innovation Elements (EIE) as suggested by (Sheng and Kok-Soo 2010), 
(Chang and Chen 2004):  
A-Reduce the material intensity of its good and service (Material reduction)  
B-Reduce the energy intensity of its good and service (Energy reduction) 
C-Reduce the dispersion of any toxic materials (toxicity reduction) 
D-Enhance the recyclability of its materials (Material retrieval) 
E-Maximize the sustainable use of renewable resources (Resource sustainable) 
F-Extend the durability of its product (Product durability) 
G-Increase the service intensity of its good and service (Product Service) 
This step gives clarity on which eco-element has priority, the elements that is repeated the most has the most priority. 
The next step will be to extract the corresponding Design Parameter (DP) from the 39 DPs proposed by TRIZ. From 
the EIE vs DP matrix. The most recurrent DPs will be extracted and arranged by pairs to constitute the pair 
(#Improving Parameters; #Worsening parameters), this step can generate a big number of Inventive Principles (IP), 
sorting them by the recurrence of appearance, gives us the most redundant IP to use for solving the problem. it’s the 
IP that appears the most that will have the most significant impact on the solution. 
 
The last phase, which is the post processing phase, is a reverse migration, from the conceptual solution field to the 
factual solution field. It is worth mentioning that the IFR and the set of harmful action sentences need to be kept in 
mind during the solution generation step. The Brainstorming technique, even if it was negatively perceived by 
Altshuller (1999) and considered the incarnation of trial-and-error method. It could be of a great help if used in a 
sequentially guided context and meant to generate final solutions from a set of predefined IPs and knowledge base. 
The brainstorming will be guided with a set of questions formulated with the question:  How can +IP+ Verb + set of 
harmful effects previously developed. 
 
This step is an iterative step and needs as many iterations as necessary, each solution generated is compared to the 
IFR as an assessment method. Finally, the ultimate solution will be formulated. The knowledge base gives us a great 
deal of flexibility and frees the solvers mind from psychological inertia (Savransky 2000). 
 
4.Conclusion 
This paper has first demonstrated the necessity of developing a method to solve complex multi-contradiction natural 
problems in an eco-efficient way, secondly it has developed a procedure to serve as a guideline for problem solver. 
The step-by-step guide translates the problem to a set of abstract contradictions, and formulate the IFR, the

contradictions are solved by TRIZ tools and Eco-Innovation elements, and then the method proposes a sequential 
brainstorming to develop the final solution. The method needs to be tried out with a series of case studies on real 
natural process challenges to assess its effectiveness and its ease of use.

Abstract 
Performance management aligns individual aims with organizational aims. It is to obtain better organizational 
outcomes managing and understanding performance within an agreed framework of planned objectives, standards and 
requirements. The main elements of performance management are agreement, measurement, feedback, positive 
reinforcement and dialogue. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, also named as the CCR model, proposed 
by Charnes et al. (1978), computes the relative efficiency of a decision-making unit (DMU) by maximizing the ratio 
of its total weighted outputs to its total weighted inputs subject to the condition that the output to input ratio of every 
DMU be less than or equal to unity. However, conventional DEA model assigns unrealistic weights to the inputs and 
outputs to produce high efficiency score for the evaluated DMU and therefore the number of efficient DMUs can be 
quite high. To overcome that issue, common-weight DEA-based models are proposed by the scholars. In this study, 
performance evaluation of a technology company that performs in the retail sector is conducted and the results are 
analyzed.

1. Introduction
Performance management is to achieve better organizational outcomes by understanding and managing performance 
within an agreed framework of planned objectives, standards and requirements. This process exists to establish a 
common understanding of what needs to be done for the management and development in the short and long terms.  
The main elements of performance management are agreement, measurement, feedback, positive reinforcement and 
dialogue. Performance management focuses on planning and improving future performance rather than a retrospective 
performance assessment. It operates as a continuous and evolving process, in which performance improves over time; 
and provides the basis for regular and frequent dialogues between managers and individuals on performance and 
development needs. It mainly concerns individual performance but can also apply to teams.  
In the literature, it is seen that many studies on performance evaluation have been carried out. In recent years, personnel 
evaluation (Parades et al.  2019; He  2019), project performance evaluation (Brelih et al.  2019; Chatterjee  2018), 
evaluation of logistics service providers (Zarbakhshnia et al.  2018; Narkhede et al.  2017) supplier performance 
evaluation (Prashanth et al.  2020; Dos Santos and Godoy  2019; Liu et al. 2019) are at the forefront. Data envelopment

According to the results of CCR model, stores 2, 4, 8, and 10 are efficient. Model (3) addressed in Jahanshahloo et al. 
(2010) ranks the DMUs that are efficient with regard to the CCR results, in other words, it ranks the units that CCR 
model does not able to discriminate. In addition, Model (4) addressed in Jahanshahloo et al. (2010) ranks the DMUs 
according to a special unit, which is selected as DMU10 in this study since that DMU is the best performing unit with 
regard the Model (3). On the other hand, DMU4 is determined as the most efficient DMU according to the model 
proposed by Toloo (2012), followed by DMU9 and DMU7. 
4. Conclusion
Customer needs vary daily in a globalizing environment because of the competition and rapid change. Companies' 
ability to survive in this complicated structure is dependent on their grasp of environmental changes and their ability 
to adjust to them. Employees' levels of knowledge and abilities, on the other hand, are rising, and they are expected 
to do more than just their duties; they are also expected to think and make decisions. The performance management 
system is regarded as one of the most significant management systems for achieving a company's objectives. 
In this work, performance assessment of a technology company that performs in the retail sector is conducted. First 
classical CCR method is employed to determine the efficient stores. Employee number, area of the store and total 
premium are considered as inputs whereas NPS, conversion rate and total turnover are supposed as outputs of the 
model. CCR model dichotomized stores as efficient and inefficient but it did not provide full ranking of the stores. 
Common-weight DEA-based model introduced by Jahanshahloo et al. (2010) and Toloo (2012) are utilized for ranking 
the stores. Future research will focus on including qualitative data into the decision framework.

Abstract 
The provision of basic municipal services, such as water, sanitation, housing, and electricity is mandated upon all 
municipalities by the constitution of the Republic of South Africa, with the aim of ensuring that all citizens are afforded 
a dignified quality of life. However, an increase in population growth and unemployment rate has spiked dependency 
and demand of these services to an extent that most communities have been protesting over the lack of service delivery. 
As a result, most municipalities are currently battling to provide sustainable services in terms of quantity and quality 
to their communities because of the following challenges: non-compliance with procurement processes and municipal 
finance legislation, complexity of projects, inability to generate sustainable revenue and lack of consequence 
management. As a strategy to enable municipalities to provide sustainable services and improve on their annual 
organizational performance, this study analysed qualitative data obtained from government documents, websites, 
legislative frameworks, and research papers to compare key critical success factors for sustainable service delivery 
namely: Institutional structures, Service delivery needs, financial viability, and technology models between a category 
A (City of Ekurhuleni) and category B (Emfuleni Local Municipality). The gaps identified were then tailored using 
The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and Zachman Framework to recommend a system of systems 
(SoS) called the Real-Time Integrated Collaborative Model (RTICM). This RTICM is expected to enable 
municipalities to achieve a level of sustainability and enhance real-time intergovernmental relations between all 
spheres of government and external stakeholders.

1. Introduction
According to chapter 7 of the constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996) one of the objectives of all 
municipalities is to provide sustainable services to their communities to protect human dignity, these include water, 
sanitation, housing, and electricity. This constitutional mandate is achieved through various municipal processes such 
as the Integrated Development Plan (IDP), Service Delivery Budget Implementation Plan (SDBIP) and in compliance 
with legislative mandates such as, but not limited to, the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA, Act 56 of 
2003), Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA, Act 5 of 2000) and Division of Revenue Act (DoRA 
4, 2020). Even though there has been significant progress made over the years in providing these services, increases 
in population growth and unemployment rate (Stats S.A  2016) have spiked the level of dependency and demand of 
services on municipalities such that most communities have been protesting over the lack of service delivery.  
In addition, research conducted by (Van der Merscht and Van Jaarsveld  2012) indicated that the lack of consultation 
and cooperation between municipalities results to ineffective delivery of infrastructure services that is poor, costly, 
and unsustainable. Therefore, to improve the status quo of municipalities this study analysed qualitative data obtained 
from government documents, websites, legislative frameworks, and relevant research papers to compare key critical 
success factors of sustainable service delivery (Louis 2003) namely: Institutional structures, Service delivery needs, 
financial viability, and technology models between a category A (City of Ekurhuleni) and Category B (Emfuleni Local 
Municipality). The gaps identified were then tailored using The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and 
Zachman Framework to develop and recommend a system of systems (SoS) called the Real-Time Integrated

6. Conclusions 
The main objective of conducting this research using such a methodology, was to outline how government institutions 
have progressed over the years in providing services and how they can improve their current project management 
approaches with the aim of providing sustainable services to their communities. In addition, the problem statement of 
this research was to establish the reasons why the operating procedures of various departments in most municipalities 
are still disintegrated and to understand the factors that contribute towards continuous non-compliance with the 
constitutional and government legislation, as both these guidelines are necessary for spheres of government to achieve 
optimum performance and clean audits while providing sustainable basic services to their respective communities 
without compromising job opportunities. As an emphasis, the data that was analyzed from both municipalities 
indicated that there is still a high dependance on manual processing of project documentation between various 
stakeholders, thereby indicating the lack of technology based standardized operating procedures (SOPs) and limiting 
the capabilities that are associated with the use of e-government systems. Furthermore, the latest municipal audit 
reports supported the need for a real-time collaboration model such as the proposed RTICM, to enable 
intergovernmental interaction that will speed up obtaining or sharing resources amongst municipalities and removing 
the stigma of spheres of government “competing’’ against each other. 
 
6.1 Future Research 
The proposed RTICM framework is a standard operating tool that is recommended for adoption by government 
institutions to enable them to shift from traditional manual operating procedures to real-time online systems that can 
assist municipalities to deliver sustainable services while improving their performance and collaboration. Therefore, 
there are still opportunities for future research on developing, testing, and operating the actual system.

Abstract 
Vaccine diplomacy has been at the center of China's foreign policy after being heavily criticized for the initial spread 
of the virus and its approach in handling the disease. This paper examines the strategies of China's vaccine diplomacy 
in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, this paper uses descriptive qualitative methods where the 
phenomenon of vaccine diplomacy carried out by China will be associated with the theory of nation branding by using 
secondary data collection, the data were obtained from the official documents of the Chinese Government and the 
Indonesian Government, along with the official website registered with the Indonesian press council. Other supporting 
data were obtained from books and journals that were the source of writing this research. Analyzed using three 
indicators in nation branding by Anholt, namely substance, strategy, and symbolic actions, this paper found that the 
strategy built by China through vaccine diplomacy was able to deal with the pandemic first and have an impact on the 
deteriorating image of China. In addition, the strategy adopted is a form of branding for Chinese biotechnology 
companies, as well as a form of strengthening and expanding China's influence.

Abstract 
Climate change is one of the most widely debated issues in the world because of the rise in greenhouse gas emissions 
during the industrial revolution. Corporations contribute to this to happen. They publish Social and Environmental 
Responsibility Report to indicate their responsibility to the environment. This study aims at exploring how Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting, carbon emissions disclosure, and eco-efficiency applications affect value of 
the corporation.  Multiple linear regression analysis using SPSS 26 was to analyse the data. This study found that CSR 
has no relationship with firm value. Meanwhile, disclosure of carbon emissions substantially gives adverse impact on 
firm value. The same applies for eco-efficiency which reduces the firm value. These findings demonstrates that CSR, 
carbon emissions disclosure, and eco-efficiency have a significant negative effect on firm value computed by PBV. 
They evidently had little effect on especially the fluctuation of the company's stock price.

1. Introduction
Climate change is one of the most debatable and controversial issues around the world. According to Berkeley Earth 
Monitoring Group, there are no indications for climate cooling in 2021 as human activities have been creating more 
heats (Tombeg, 2022). The rise of the earth temperature is most commonly due to higher emissions of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution which are caused by human activities such as combustion of 
fossil fuels that emits carbon dioxide.  The industrial revolution had affected accounting in particularly reporting 
(Rusmana & Purnaman, 2020). Even though primary goal of a company is to generate profit, it must nevertheless use 
its resources effectively. According to Limited Company Law No. 40, Article 74 of 2007, Indonesian firms that depend 
on natural resources for their activities must be aware of the environment conservation and be socially responsible. 
The success of the corporate social and environmental responsibility programmes are not indicated by their execution 
only but also by their communication. When communication of the company Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
meets or surpasses customers’ expectations, the company can reap more advantages from its CSR initiatives (Kim & 
Ferguson  2018). Moreover, to minimize the environmental effect of the production wastes, the company must ensure 
that the wastes give insignificant impact to the environment. Eco-efficiency concept is thus considerably appropriate 
for a company to manage its wastes. 
Company annual report containing company's long-term commitment, performance of the year, and other 
achievements serves as a mean of communication to the investors and the shareholders as well as an evaluation for 
prospective investors who want to invest in the company. According to the study of Utomo, Rahayu, Kaujan, and 
Irwandi (2020), the environmental performance has a favourable influence on environmental disclosure and firm 
value. Nevertheless, environmental disclosure has evidently no impact on firm value and does not change the impact 
of environmental performance on firm value. As the consequence, CSR disclosure and its components such as efficient 
waste management and carbon emission control have an impact on firm value. Although no regulation specifies which 
components of CSR should be reported, company can have additional value from the investors and stakeholders by 
implementing CSR. Companies operating in particularly manufacturing industry must have CSR report from which 
investors and stakeholders can recognize how seriously they take their environmental and social responsibilities. In

Abstract 
Green Business has been a detrimental topic to the current industry in almost every sector. Therefore, there need to be 
actions that help us transition into a more sustainable future. This research studies how Pro-Environmental Behaviour 
(PE) might influence Leadership for Sustainability (LS) and how this could motivate others to have a more sustainable 
lifestyle. This study is carried out with questionnaires for employees in Jakarta. It will be analyzed using the Rasch 
measurement model and Linear Regression analysis. As for how it turned out, PE indeed proved to have a significant 
influence on LS. Therefore, most people do have a high degree of PE and LS. Most people who have a high degree of 
LS were also accompanied by a high degree of PE. This implies that most people have a vision for a better, more 
sustainable future and are actively working towards it. Therefore, there should be help from businesses to help them 
achieve this. The questionnaires were filled out by 221 respondents, and a total of 191 were taken as valid responses.

1. Introduction
Green Business has been a detrimental topic to the current industry in almost every sector possible. Cases of 
environmental pollution have been increasing over the years (Maciel  2017). As ecological pollution keeps growing, 
problems revolving around environmental health such as flooding, increased temperature, air pollution, and so on will 
also increase (Maciel  2017; McKinsey  2021). Businesses are being railed against this issue because the business 
process always impacts the environment regardless of its significance (Maciel  2017). Therefore, the business must 
focus on this topic as they are the primary source of the problem. 
Green management refers to producing environmentally friendly products or services. They are practicing their 
business process with behaviour that minimizes the harmful environmental impact of their packaging, marketing, and 
so on (McKinsey  2021). Building sustainability will not be just a trend anymore. Instead, it will be the standard for 
the market, meaning pro-environmental behavior is on the rise, and it is not showing any signs of stopping (McKinsey 
2021). 
There is a pretty clear rise in green consumerism where the consumer would choose the option that is more sustainable. 
To help prove this statement, a survey done by (OneTreePlanted  2019) reveals three important points in green 
consumerism. The first, consumers would expect businesses to do their business more than just to turn a profit. Second

Moving on through Linear Regression analysis, we can find the regression equation to be Y=43,296+0,449X. Where 
Y represents the Leadership for Sustainability and X represents Pro-Environmental Behaviour, this shows that PE 
have a positive influence on LS. With the R2 value being 0,402 also shows that 40,2% of PE responsible for the 
changes in LS. 
 
Through the coefficient analysis table from SPSS result, we can find the main objective for this study which is the 
hypotheses test whether Pro-Environmental Behaviour have a significant influence on Leadership for Sustainability 
or not. Through the t-test as the second hypotheses test, we can find that t calculated higher than the t table and the 
significancy value to be smaller than alpha value of 0,5. This draws the conclusion that Pro-Environmental Behaviour 
have a signiciant influence on Leadership for Sustianbility. Additionally, the regression equation shows that PE have 
a positive influence on LS. 
 
The most important discovery of this study is that it is proven to be true that PE does have a significant influence on 
LS. Using this as a leverage, business could gain competitive advantage in implementing pro-environmental 
behaviours to achieve the leadership in the sustainability field. Not only businesses, this finding could also be used by 
governments to make regulations that is pressing more on sustainability. With the significant positive influence PE 
has, organizational culture should adopt sustainability in its processes to maintain its growth.  
 
These findings aid in the understanding of the preceding research done by (Pabian & Pabian  2022; Hammer & Pivo 
2017) where they found that most sustainable leaders are equipped with the knowledge and behaviours of pro-
environmental, and pro-environmental behaviour is also presence in making compliance on sustainability. This 
indicates that pro-environmental behaviour plays a role in making a leader considered as being sustainable and have 
a sustainability leadership style. The findings of this study has implications for raising self-awareness and developing 
programs or systems that encourage people to pick a more sustainable options that emphasize more on pro-
environmental habits. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The topic surrounding green business and sustainable options have increased over the year where companies need to 
take leadership in sustainability for achieving competitive advantage, however to do that, pro-environmental 
behaviours and habits are imminent. The study aims to find if there is an influence from Pro-Environmental Behaviour 
towards the Leadership for Sustainability. Usage of Rasch model analysis and Linear Regression analysis is done to 
prove the validity of the hypotheses. 
 
The wright map in Rasch model analysis was used to describe the phenomenon in this research. From the wright map 
we can draw some conclusions such as: most of the respondents have high degree of Pro-Environmental Behaviour 
(78,5%) and most of the respondents also have high degree of Leadership for Sustainability (83.2%), additionally, on 
the comparison, most respondents that have high degree of Leadership for Sustainability also have a high degree of 
Pro-Environmental Behaviour (94,59%). 
 
The study hypotheses were validated by two methods, Rasch model and Linear Regression. The Rasch model indicated 
that there is a significant difference on Leadership for Sustainability from high degree and low degree of Pro-
Environmental Behaviour. Meanwhile, Linear Regression indicated that there is a significant influence on Leadership 
for Sustainability from Pro-Environmental Behaviour.  
 
According to the study’s findings, the employees in Jakarta that is considered as consumer market have been actively 
working towards a more sustainable future by implementing pro-environmental behaviours and making sustainable 
choices, even in their leadership style. This suggests that the shift to a sustainable future is prominent and businesses 
might acquired competitive advantage by taking leadership in sustainability. Furthermore, the findings should help 
raise the awareness from individual, businesses, and even governments to take action and to encourage more 
sustainable choices. 
 
There are still limitations to the research that can be suggestions for the future research and researchers. First, it would 
be preferable if the study were done on multiple variables instead of just between two variables, the presence of other 
variables helps us decide which variables are influencing the independent variable in the study, it also helps us 
1813","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

understand what course of actions we can take to adapt into a more sustainable future. Second, there should be 
additional research on specific group of people and may even from other proximity area, constraining the amount of 
population in the study to further clarify the effect these variables has, preferably towards group of people that will be 
leaders in the future. Last but not least, it would be a great addition to have research on the older generations as how 
these type of research are mostly done with the younger generations being its object of research. Future research may 
also connects these variables and object of research into one to further describe the phenomenon.

Abstract 
The ever-changing business all around the globe keep the organizations on tiptoes to thrive and succeed in dynamic 
environment. As a result, the accomplishment of an organization largely depends upon the how agile it is toward the 
changes which results in superior business performance. The factors, domain and functional approach varies between 
the organizations in service and manufacturing. Both are different in characteristics; therefore, they have different 
effect on their success. Much study has been done on organizational agility in manufacturing sector but very few 
research have been conducted in services. There is a need to study the gap. This paper attempt to highlight the 
functional domain through secondary information and underpin key factor in service as well as manufacturing sector 
which will help in setting further explorative research agenda.

Abstract 
An allergy is a person's reaction when exposed to chemicals, typically harmless for other people in an environment. 
Allergens are believed to occur in dust mites, animals, pollen, flies, ticks, molds and some medicine. As 20% of 
household middle incomes go to restaurants to go for a bite. One in a family of five will likely have allergies to the 
food they eat. Being exposed to substances is a daily occurrence for an individual and there is always a chance to be 
exposed to unknown chemicals that can harm a person without knowing the contents of the substance. This paper 
focuses on helping users navigate safely in the menu of a restaurant with their allergies considered. The developed 
system followed a software methodology system that includes gathering of data, requirements analysis, system design, 
implementation, and testing. A user acceptance testing was conducted with a satisfactory result.

1. Introduction
A primary research focus in the fields of information technology was the ""Decision Support System"" (DSS). DSS was 
described as a computerized system used to help organizational decisions in pursuit of advanced decision support 
systems implementation. DSS has always been a recognized research topic. Recommender systems are well supported 
in the foundations of incremental rules. The rules of these systems could differentiate from one data to another in 
respect of strengths and weaknesses. Using both systems, DSS would be able to create statistical data from the 
population that uses the recommender system such as interests, characteristics and traits.   
Food has various traits and characteristics that can go well with these systems and it is one of the basic needs of an 
average everyday Filipino. Even if it is a basic need of Filipinos, it can be harmful to lethal because of allergies 
depending on the severity of that person. Food Allergy is leading to adverse health effects that affect 4% to 7% of our 
population (Burks et al. 2020). Food allergies can cause an estimated 150-200 people to die every year (Lokman and 
Akoglu, 2022), and half of the estimated person died because of the fatal reactions happening in a restaurant or any 
fast-food chain. The eight most common food allergies represent 90% of all food allergy reactions and these are; Milk 
which is the most common food allergy in infants and children including butter, cheese, and ice cream; Egg next to 
milk allergy in children; Peanut being one of the most common allergy; Tree nuts including walnuts pistachios, pine 
nuts and any kind of nuts; Soybean being one of the most common allergy in children; Wheat allergy usually below 
three years old; Shellfish allergy includes shrimp, crab, lobster and mussels; and Fish as last of the most common 
allergy.

5. Conclusion  
This study aims to develop a web-based application food recommendation system specialized in allergy information. 
Through, this course of study, we have implemented a user management module wherein the admin monitors the users 
in the admin dashboard. In the user management module, the admin can observe the basic information of the users 
such as name, email and allergy information. The allergy filtration, or the allergy checking module, can help the users 
find a safe suitable restaurant to dine in and enjoy. We have also implemented a food category module in the search 
feature, along with the allergy checking module, to easily display the safe meals for the user as well as the restaurant 
the meal is available. Users can also help one another by leaving feedback to restaurants on how good or how bad 
their services are. It can also serve as a warning whenever there is allergy residue stuck on the cooking station.

In order to have an easy evaluation of the users in the web application, an admin dashboard was added to the admin 
account so that the admin can oversee which users were using the web application and which food allergy was most 
common among them. The number of restaurants and which category was most common in the web application can 
also be seen in the admin dashboard. The results show that according to the respondents, the system is easy to use 
throughout the testing; and all of the features were used and only a few respondents asked for improvements in the 
system. 
6. Recommendation
The study recommends having a physical test with the food establishment owner and end user (people with allergy). 
The testing is conducted online due to the pandemic the researchers can’t hold a physical testing of the web application 
with the food establishment owner and end user (people with allergy). This study also recommends having an actual 
demo to everyone to see if the web application is useful to all allergens and to have multiple respondents since there 
were only a limited number of respondents for the testing especially in food establishment owners. Additional features 
to the web application is also further suggested.

Abstract 
E-Learning is described as a mode of acquiring knowledge through the use of modern technologies to access
educational resources outside the traditional classroom set up. With these concepts, the proponents decided to develop
this project to utilize computer in aiding in learning particularly Chemistry Laboratory. In a survey conducted to
Mapua SHS students and Chemistry Professors, most agrees that a chemistry laboratory simulation would help them
in the subject. The project aims to help students understand and prepare them for the actual laboratory experiment
because students lack preparation for the experiment and the familiarization of equipment, utensils and procedures for
that experiment. The simulation of laboratory experiments will focus on trying to recreate the outcome of the real
experiment in a simulated environment while also having real-life visual and audio for the students. Tools for
developing simulation applications have evolved from simulation subroutines to high level process languages built to
visual development. A feature of a computer-based simulation is the possibility to replicate every possible scenario at
a very low cost.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, computers are beneficial in modern education like laboratory being used for interactive lectures, online 
quizzes, animations, collaborative learning tool to aid in accelerating data collection, analysis and especially pre-
laboratory tutorials (Loveys and Riggs 2019). An example of this is the CISCO packet tracer (Alfarsi et al. 2019). 
Experimental simulation offers an effective solution for peers in the science to meet their laboratory requirement.   
Technology having the ability to bridge gap in traditional learning is often the pivot of debate than its value to boost 
learning (Abu Talib et al. 2021). Studies have shown that the utilization of computer simulations for learning 
supplements for subjects (Novaliendry et al. 2020) like biology, geology, physics, math and chemistry does promote 
learning (Zargaran et al. 2020). Simulated Activities have its edge over hands-on laboratory work such as enabling 
students to do more hazardous and complicated experiments (Mahtari et al. 2020) without risking the student or the 
environment, they can also obtain accurate results more quickly without factors that increase the percentage errors 
such as air friction, pressure, room temperature, impure or contaminated chemicals, faulty apparatus and inaccurate 
weighing scale (MaKechnie et al. 2020). Disadvantages includes the lack of the capability to experience the actual 
feel of the experiment and errors associated with laboratory simulations (Ratcliffe et al. 2021). Available software for 
simulations in chemistry varies depending on the graphics available (Haydary 2019). The simulation of laboratory 
experiments will focus on trying to recreate the outcome of the real experiment in a simulated environment while also 
having real-life visual and audio for the students (Hamilton et al. 2021). By engaging students in making a strong 
impression that will stimulate more senses with the expectation that the information will be more understandable 
strategy. This study designed a wide range of learning aids in a chemistry course to students by providing an equal 
amount of encounter in standard laboratory practice using a simulated environment.

6. Conclusion  
The use of E-Learning is improving the way the teachers interact with their students and enhance the distribution of 
educational content than the traditional classroom. The problem of chemistry students is that they lack preparation for 
the upcoming activity. By using the E-Learning application, the students can practice for their activity. Therefore, the 
use of E-Learning is beneficial to this modern age where evolving technologies can help bridge the gap between 
technology and learning.  
 
The system, named E-CHEMIFY: A Virtual Laboratory for Chemical Experiments 2D Simulator – Android 
Application will help the students familiarize with the right equipment to use for the experiment and be mentally 
prepared for the activity. The system can simulate chemical process of each laboratory activities from the Senior High 
School’s General Chemistry 1 Manual and an instructor can assess a student enrolled in their class. It also includes 
various features such as Class Key Generator, Student Roster, Gradebook, and Edit Exercise.

Abstract 
E-commerce is a technological application that has proven very useful, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The
presence of e-commerce websites, online shopping, and presence of other virtual services has increased during
lockdown and quarantine periods when people tend to spend most of their time in their houses. The recommender
system made an e-commerce website sustainable to the needs of its customers. The direct transaction of local
producers makes a convenient price lookout for those who are living in the city. This study developed an e-commerce
website that caters to the need of urban consumers to cut costs through direct shopping of goods to local producers.
This study aims to see what features of the developed system can be identified as a factor to be called useable. In this
context, usability is defined as a measurement to perceive how easy, or effective can one do a task. To determine the
usability of the system, multiple standard questionnaires such as Nielsen Heuristics Evaluation and Questionnaire for
User Interface Satisfaction were deployed. Random sampling was done in three (3) groups of end-users, specifically,
the consumers, the store vendors, and the store owners. The results showed that some factors need improvement, but
the system’s overall design reflected how satisfactory it is to the target users. Finally, it may be concluded that the
system has successfully reflected the user interface design from the prototype to the final system, which satisfied one
of the six styles of usability requirements, the design style.

1. Introduction
The evolution of technology, specifically the internet, has given the world a new perspective. It gave life to e-
commerce. From diverse platforms where people can shop, or establish their businesses, it is taking everyone by storm 
(Alyoubi et al. 2020). Online shopping and its convenience have been an integral part of almost everyone (Trang et 
al. 2020). With devices such as laptops, cellphones and tablets are getting cheaper and cheaper (Kumar and Mittal 
2020), and the Filipinos love for being active users of social media (Reyes et al. 2018), it is no surprise that they are 
easily exposed to online shopping (Nartea et al. 2019).  
The Philippines is a developing country and its technological infrastructure in the country is changing (Rudnick and 
Velasquez 2019), giving lots of opportunities for the Filipinos to work in the wonderful world of technology (Tudy 
2021). That emerging trend of online services has become a demand, especially during COVID-19 pandemic (Pastor 
2020). The pandemic changed the way we live in and we learned to survive during the lockdown period. E-commerce 
websites were started to be noticed and used by those who never utilized it before. Since then, there is an increasing 
demand for anyone who wants to find a way on how to maximize the use of Internet, e-commerce facilities most 
especially. 
The convenience of doing a seamless transaction online has been proven long time ago (Diana and Leon 2020). Some 
customers do not pick online shopping as a viable option because of the expensive items and service fees included, 
meaning, budget is an issue (Nguyen et al. 2019). Multi-path retailing is now the standard way of expanding products 
across countries. Online retailing is considered one of the fastest ways for distribution channel growth (Park and

from 8.21. Table 4 shows that users find the reliability of the application is decent. Some users mentioned that they 
were not able to change their account information after registering. But overall, they are still satisfied with the speed 
and reliability.

The Overall Reaction to the Software of the respondents is shown in Table 5. The overall reaction of the respondents 
is slightly good when they realized the purpose of the project as helpful for those people who want to expand their 
businesses in their barangays. The system was said to be easy to use by most of them as they already have initial 
knowledge of how to deal with online shopping. The design was amusing as it caught their attention because of its 
simplicity. Although, there were things that bother them, like the website template, which was not edited initially. 
Respondents were able to point out the importance of cashless transactions in our current situation. They saw that the 
system can still be improved, nevertheless, they are satisfied as they realized that the extension of help to expand the 
area coverage of low earning businesses is great. Table 5 shows that the overall reaction of the respondents is slightly 
good when they realized the purpose of the project as helpful for those people who want to expand their businesses in 
their local communities.

5. Conclusion
As the study aimed to know the features in the developed system that can adapt to the usability requirement, the 
researchers build an e-commerce application for products, such as meat, seafood, and fresh produce. The features of 
the developed system are the inventory for products and admin management. Moreover, along with the functional 
requirements, the system has successfully reflected the user interface design from the prototype to the final application, 
which satisfied one of the six styles of usability requirements, the design style.

In comparison among the system features, inventory was the most impactful because the vendors will obtain a digital 
inventory system that will surely help their business. Therefore, it increases their task efficiency, making them adapt 
to design style. The admin management was helpful, but some of the respondents highlighted that the admin needs to 
check the vendors' products. Overall result of the QUIS conducted showed that the developed system satisfied the 
needs of its intended users.

Abstract 
Locating available healthcare facilities and other medical services has been in demand since the Covid-19 pandemic 
and post-pandemic. With technological advancement when it comes to location mapping, GIS or Geographic 
Information Systems are useful tools for locating hospitals and laboratory testing facilities other than hospitals. The 
remaining challenges in finding healthcare facilities were the absence of a referral system that prevents the 
opportunities from locating appropriate healthcare facilities and getting medical advice from hospitals regarding 
medical tests, and procedures. Patients often skip the first level of facilities to seek care from level 2 and 3 facilities, 
which can lead to the increased cost to receive health care, as there is no effective referral system. The study aimed to 
benefit healthcare access in the Philippines by providing accurate information gathered from outpatient care services. 
This study provides assistance to those who struggle with the accessibility to services for health-related issues. The 
system has the opportunity to aid citizens to gain region-wide information about available laboratory facilities. This 
study also aims to aid and benefit future research on the integration of at-location mapping technology in healthcare.

1. Introduction
Primary health care plays a critical role in keeping countries safe from health security threats like outbreaks of diseases 
(Causevic et al. 2018). Primary health care ensures that people have a partner in their health needs from birth and all 
throughout life – through health promotion, disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care (WHO 
2018).  
Healthcare has never been more important today, with the sudden appearance of COVID 19 pandemic, the Philippine 
government conducted contact tracing and issued travel bans with neighboring countries. While the prohibitions 
prevented potentially infected people from spreading the disease in the Philippines, travelers from other countries 
where the disease was already spreading but not subject to the travel bans were not tested. The Philippine government 
responded to both developments by declaring a ‘community quarantine’ for Metro Manila and was made even more 
stringent by extending the quarantine to the whole island of Luzon (Amit et al. 2020). 
Location mapping is a fundamental service in mobility. In outdoor applications such as wildlife tracking, participatory 
environmental sensing, and personal health and wellness applications. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the 
most common location sensor (Allahbakshi et al. 2020). The development of mobile devices, especially smartphones 
and tablets, is proliferating. Starting from the average number of users who progressively increase mobile devices 
drastically. Mobile technology has also been growing with the availability of a variety of platforms (Swastikasari et 
al. 2018).

5. Conclusion 
The main objective of the study is to develop a map locator using search feature for individuals looking for health 
facilities that offers laboratory testing with appointment scheduling based on the laboratory test they need and those 
who wanted to talk to health care providers through customer service and helpdesk. Based on the unit testing, all 
program bugs have been fixed and met all the requirements set in the study. 
 
Specifically, the study have done the following to achieve the objective of the study: gather multiple hospital services 
information in the Philippines’ national capital region (NCR); design a database for hospital services information such 
as doctors and facilities, patient profile, and appointment scheduling through customer service; and, to develop a web-
based information system that utilizes GoogleMaps API for location mapping. The User Acceptance Test (UAT), 
resulted in respondents’ satisfaction. The result shows that majority of the respondents are satisfied with the 
appearance of LabSeek while there are some areas that we can improve on. The overall user experience results were 
mostly satisfactory while a small percentage of users experienced issues, the researchers have successfully fixed 
present issues. 100% of the respondents liked using the web application and 95.2% of the respondents found the web 
app necessary. The results show that LabSeek has done its intended purpose which includes easy navigation, user-
friendliness, and successful transactions between the user and the facility. 
 
The study has concluded that the developed web application achieved its objective. The specific goal of locating and 
directing users to an outpatient laboratory testing facilities in national capital region (NCR) are successfully executed. 
The developed application provides accurate searching for laboratory testing facilities without finding hospitals one 
by one online. 
 
6. Recommendations  
The researchers identified the following recommendations on future research that can help utilize the maximum 
potential of the system: expanding the scope of the system where the laboratory facilities in the system can be made 
available extensively and not limited in a region. Expanding the covered hospital and laboratory facilities are also 
highly recommended. And lastly, to include features like text-to-speech” and “speech-to-text” for the use of people 
with special needs and with disabilities.

Abstract 
Technology is developing at a faster pace than ever before. Thus, it becomes very important for hotels and the 
hospitality industry to combine the latest technological innovations to expand their business base and customers. 
Today's tourists are more interested in experiencing virtual technology while they are on travel. Tourist need an online 
information about accommodation that they can easily find wherever they go to. A hotel with its virtual images on 
their website or other booking applications would interest tourists. However, it was confirmed that a virtual hotel tour 
is also an option that most travelers choose to observed before booking a room. Unlike the previous photos and digital 
imagery, with the help of a virtual hotel tour, viewers can fully immerse themselves into the hotel facilities and can 
judge the state of the hotel. This study aims to prove customer acceptance of the performance of Virtual Reality 
technology in the hotel industry so as to increase tourist intention to come and stay at hotels. This research will be 
carried out by collecting primary data derived from the dissemination of surveys with purposive sampling techniques. 
This research will be analyzed with structure equation modeling analysis techniques.

1. Introduction
Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that can make users 'close to reality'. Virtual Reality can be found in various
ways, for example in the activity of a training simulation along with training materials, online games, displaying a
location or activity at  the event (Chiao et al.  2018). All views can be seen by the audience as if they are real and close

acceptance of the use of virtual reality technology, namely perceived Usefulness, Perceived ease of use and Attitude 
regarding virtual reality technology used by potential customers. All three show the results that all variables have a 
positive influence on the intention to behave in the future.  Perceived of Usefulness  is the most important factor in 
creating behavioral intentions and optimally influencing users for future hotel visits. With this research, it provides 
recommendations to take advantage of virtual tour hotels as an effort to provide additional information about products, 
facilities, infrastructure and facilities at the intended hotel. Another suggestion is for VR travel service providers to 
start considering the use of various technologies that support the best quality results of content. 
 
Research Limitation 
Researchers suggested testing the models used against various forms of Virtual reality Hotel  activities specifically 
based on the category of tourist destinations. It is necessary to know the perspective of VR users specifically because 
this study only measures in outline of Hotel’s Virtual Reality. Additional variables needed for subsequent research are 
the degree of authenticity of the content displayed, and the on-site experience of the user. In addition, it is necessary 
to conduct in-depth interviews to find out personally and in detail related to the behavior of Hotel VR users. If the 
addition is made, it will provide a very deep knowledge related to VR Hotels.

Abstract 
In order to improve the Supply Chain, satisfy the customer's expectations in terms of quality and deadlines, and 
improve the internal management of its resources, many manufacturing companies, works perpetually for the 
implementation of improvement and corrective actions to reduce quality defects and limit customer complaints. 
To ensure a good quality of the product, it is necessary to act on several parameters such as the diversity of the 
types of products produced on the same line and this, by elaborating an optimized planning of the production and 
by ensuring a sequencing of the references which maximizes the efficiency and minimizes quality defects. This 
paper, therefore, is concerned with the daily planning of production based on a mathematical model that minimizes 
the difference in product production times in order to maintain optimal speed of the line. As a result of this 
mathematical model, we get two decision variables: the quantity to be produced by each shift and the order of 
production per shift per reference, those results will help the planner to avoid shortage on the customer side and 
the producer to improve the KPIs related to the output quantity and the defaults percentage.

1. Introduction
In order to survive in an increasingly globalized and competitive marketplace, companies today must build, and 
rely upon continuous improvement on Supply Chain Management. Today, and more than ever, companies 
operating in the industry find themselves obliged to improve their industrial performance. It is in this perspective 
that the automotive industry strives to improve the quality of its product, its performance and its production system 
in order to better meet delivery deadlines, to adapt to its customer's demand and to achieve the desired pace. 
It is within this context that this paper fits, with the theme of optimizing the daily production planning which aims 
to improve the quality of the product and the efficiency of the production line. 
This present paper consists of three chapters. The first chapter is a literature review, the second chapter describes 
the production process and presents the problematic of the study case and the third chapter proposes a modeling 
of the problem followed by the preparation of the data and the resolution of the model. 
1.1 Objectives 
This present paper aims to improve the daily production plan taking into account the minimization of costs and 
the improvement of quality, production and logistics KPIs. 
2. Literature Review
The operational management of most industrial processes has been thriving with the systematic improvement of 
production performance indicators to address the challenges of customer satisfaction, 
manufacturing/inventory/workforce liabilities, and delivery times. The complex dynamics of production

The constraints of the shifts are therefore well respected (a margin of 3 WH). 
The order of references for each shift is presented in table 6.

To make the manipulation easier for the planner, we are working on a JAVA application that uses Cplex as a 
solver.This application has a graphical interface for entering data and must provide the results in the form of a 
table that is readable and understandable for the user. 
6. Conclusion  
This project is part of the process control and optimization production of automotive wire harnesses, with the 
objective of reducing the quality and meet customer requirements. 
Taking into account the fluctuation and unstable demand of the customer, production scheduling and planning are 
required for both respond in time to customer requests and comply with all requirements in terms of product 
compliance and quality. Our project has thus worked to control the production planning and scheduling process. 
The generated solution provides a sequencing of reference quantities to be produced by the different shifts in order 
to avoid problems of similarity and the variability of the MH relative to each reference.

Abstract 
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the key role of the pharmaceutical industry and its supply chain 
operations in society. Like in many other sectors, this pandemic has unveiled important vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
across the pharmaceutical distribution network, calling the attention for the importance of resiliency, flexibility, and 
sustainability strategies. 
One of the key challenges regarding resiliency is the ability to understand and anticipate the supply chain behaviour 
under uncertainty and dynamically manage capacity. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes a 
simulation-based approach with a twofold goal: i) to understand the pharmaceutical supply chain network dynamics, 
in order to fast-track vulnerabilities and anticipate risks propagation across the network; and ii) to support decision-
making for enhancing resiliency and flexibility, through capacity management strategic decisions. 
The main contributions of this work are grounded on the integration and exploitation of different simulation 
paradigms, in order to understand the cause-effect relationships in complex systems, under several disruption 
scenarios. In this way, the disruption risks and their propagation are identified throughout the supply chain network, 
providing insights for the proactive and timely development of contingency and risk mitigation plans.

1. Introduction
The pharmaceutical industry plays a crucial role in the healthcare structure of a country by providing medicines and 
vaccines that directly affect the quality of life of the population (Marques et al. 2020). Along with its direct importance 
in the population's well-being, this industry also highly impacts the economy of developed countries, by being a top-
performing high-technology sector (EFPIA 2020). Supply chain efficiency and resiliency can, therefore, be considered 
critical to endure a long-term sustainable growth. 
However, as scientific and technological breakthroughs take place, societal expectations increase, regulations become 
more stringent, and markets rapidly change, the complexity of managing pharmaceutical supply chains (PSC) is 
significantly increasing, along with the pressure to become more cost-efficient, responsive, and reliable, when 
developing, making, and distributing pharmaceutical drugs (Marques et al. 2020). Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic seems to have been a critical turning point regarding Supply Chain (SC) management principles and 
practices, by exposing global supply chains to a significant amount of stress, uncovering their main vulnerabilities to 
disruptions, and refocusing decision-making processes into more resilient and sustainable SC (Renn 2020). Supply

5. Conclusion 
In this work, a new simulation-based approach was developed to support decision-making for the design and capacity 
management of the pharmaceutical Supply-Chain (SC), aiming to enhance its flexibility and resiliency. This approach 
integrates two simulation methods, not only allowing a strategic analysis of the SC (through System Dynamics) but 
also identifying its main vulnerabilities by evaluating the performance of each individual agent. In this context, the 
developed approach has proven to be effective in meeting the main specific goals defined for the research, namely: i) 
understanding the SC behavior under different operational scenarios; ii) identifying the SC vulnerabilities when 
disruptions occur; iii) quantifying the impacts of disruptions and their consequences; iv) predicting the propagation of 
the disruption impacts along the SC; and finally, v) easily adapting the model to test different proactive management 
strategies to contain the disruption risks. 
As part of a wider on-going project, future work is foreseen to enhance the model by implementing a “broker” agent 
capable of evaluating the SC performance and dynamically manage its capacity, by either increasing safety stock 
levels implementing outsourcing strategies, or investing in new capacity. Furthermore, the model will be extended to 
include the ability to manage and track product expiration dates, to effectively meet pharmaceutical industry 
requirements, and to enhance the overall SC sustainability. 
Although the model was developed for the specific case of the pharmaceutical industry, it can be easily generalized 
and adapted to other industrial sectors, and this generalization will surely be exploited in future developments of the 
work.

Abstract 
In the credit acceptance process, the financial institutions analyze the borrowers' creditworthiness through their 
demographic data based on the 5C principle; character, capacity, conditions, capital, and collateral. However, the 
legacy credit scoring methods have drawbacks, including not having an excellent credit reputation as it is limited to 
the structural nature of demographic data. We construct a credit scoring model by combining the demographic element 
and adding two social media elements; content and network. The content considers creditworthiness by assessing 
borrowers' posts, which consist of opinions and conversations on social media. In comparison, the network considers 
borrowers' connectivity to their social community. The paper proposes a new credit scoring model better to represent 
the quality of borrowers' characteristics and behavior. The data is collected from LinkedIn, which is suitable to 
represent the professional network. The proposed model has been verified through expert judgment, including the 
credit providers, and has been simulated through a machine learning approach to automate credit acceptance decisions.

1. Introduction
Financial institutions previously measured creditworthiness based on financial history, socioeconomic data, and 
demographics (Niu et al. 2019). Credit scoring is generally carried out with 5C analysis, consisting of character, 
capacity, capital, condition, and collateral. Financial institutions use the 5C analysis principle to determine the 
borrower's ability and intention to return the credit received and avoid non-performing loans when the borrower's 
condition does not fulfil the requirements (Basori and Wahyuningsih 2018). Due to financing problems, the legacy 
credit scoring method is considered not optimal enough (Eprianti 2019). Other drawbacks in credit scoring using 
legacy methods include customers’ poor credit history, outdated data, and data availability (Guo et al. 2016). 
On the other hand, nowadays, we can employ social information derived from social media; as explained by Zhang et 
al. (2016), social information is suitable for describing the borrower’s behavior characteristics. One of the suitable 
social media is LinkedIn. Its proved by Garg et al. (2016), we can reveal the character and behavior of LinkedIn users 
by analyzing profile information data and LinkedIn users’ friendship networks. Moreover, LinkedIn also provides 
user conversation data. Thus, LinkedIn social media data is suitable for describing the user characteristics regarding 
demographics, conversations, and relationships. Finally, the social media data generated by users might be an 
alternative data source for conducting creditworthiness evaluations (Guo et al. 2016). 
The eligibility of prospective borrowers to obtain credit from financial institutions can be analyzed using social media 
data. This study analyzes three 5C credit scoring principles; character, capacity, and conditions. The other two 
analytical instruments, capital and collateral, are considered private and not publicly available. The three principles 
used to consist of character, capacity, and conditions. Each is represented in the user profile account features, including 
the demographic, conversation, and relationship (Guo et al. 2016). Social media data is heterogeneous and contain 
much irrelevant information. For this reason, we need a specific way to handle and transform the data to evaluate the 
creditworthiness based on character, capacity, and condition principles (Guo et al. 2016).

The TP, FN, FP, and TN value is then supplied for the model evaluation calculation. We calculate the model 
accuracy by comparing true positive and true negative with the whole data, precision by comparing true positive 
with true positive and false positive, recall by comparing true positive and true negative with true positive and 
false negative, and f-measure by comparing twice of precision and recall with precision and recall. The higher the 
evaluation value indicates a better model. The evaluation result is shown in table 7. 
 
 
Based on the decision tree classification algorithm, the proposed credit scoring model accuracy is 85.95%, the 
precision value is 91.50%, the recall value is 73.33%, and the f-measure value is 81.41%. We consider the credit 
scoring model fairly good since the high evaluation rate.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Financial institutions have the freedom to implement various types of credit scoring models. Financial institutions can 
use data tools to build their model if they have abundant data. The model we show here could be generalized into 
generic; financial institutions can make modifications according to their personalized, domain-based needs. The model 
built is an initial model for credit scoring based on LinkedIn social media data. For us, the most important thing is 
how to combine various types of data to evaluate creditworthiness. We recommend using other possible features, data 
sources, and predictive models to get an advanced model.

Abstract 
Forest management and forest operations planning are complex topics requiring a holistic approach combining 
knowledge of the domain, optimization and simulation approaches, weather forecasting models, and state-of-the-art 
technology. Our research focuses on valuing biomass through more efficient management of its operations. Removing 
forest residues from piles is essential to mitigate fire risk. On the other hand, it is a way of valuing a by-product which 
can be used for heating, energy production, and even the production of biomaterials. There is significant variability in 
the availability of forest residues, biomass demand, and the productivity of operations, particularly in the forest-to-
bioenergy supply chain. This work proposes a simulation framework to support the decision-making by combining 
plans generated by a resource allocation model with the analysis of a set of disruptive scenarios generated by discrete 
event simulation. The model addresses uncertainty in demand and variability in supply, resulting from fires. The 
obtained results provide essential managerial insights for the case study of a biomass supplier in the central region of 
Portugal and offer prescriptive recommendations to increase the efficiency and robustness of this chain in response to 
uncertainty. An extension of the methodology to other sectors appears, therefore, quite promising.

1. Introduction
The success of a company strongly depends on having a mindset centered on continuous improvement and a 
competitive strategy. Such a strategy should be based on the coordination between suppliers, production resources, 
and clients, allowing supply chains to be as flexible as possible, with a focus on versatile design and planning to 
improve effectiveness. 
Energy generated by biomass, being clean and sustainable, will play a significant role in the future, providing a real 
alternative to fossil fuels. This industry goes on growing and is very attractive, given the abundance of raw material, 
the storage convenience, and the possibility of production worldwide. It is, however, still not very profitable. The 
biomass volume also depends on external factors such as weather phenomena or geographical restrictions (Sun and 
Fan 2020). In many countries, it is expectable that biomass will become the third source of energy, requiring the 
development of intelligent decision support systems to improve supply chains' efficiency (Demirbas et al. 2009).

respectively. The third column shows the biomass increased quantity with the occurrence of a fire and the fourth 
presents the unprocessed biomass quantity at the end of the horizon. The fifth column presents the number of extra 
hours operated by each chipper for biomass processing. Column six shows the overall cost of the supply chain. Finally, 
column seven presents the service level (total processed biomass divided by total biomass available).  
 
In this example, we can see that the cost dramatically increases because of the price cost of extra hours, with 40-50% 
higher when compared with the base model. Moreover, the service level seems to be affected by the number of piles 
affected and Plan 2 has the better service level.    
 
For the “demand uncertainty” scenario, Table 3 presents a sample of the model simulation results for four instances 
tested for the three plans, with 52 piles. The first five columns show the instance setup, including the plan, the power 
plants affected, the month of the increment (occurring only once), the percentage increased quantity, and the extra 
total amount needed to satisfy the delivery nodes. Column six includes the total amount of biomass not delivered to 
the power plants, column seven presents the periods when the demand was not satisfied, and the last column provides 
the total costs. For the three plans, multiple instances were tested and analyzed. However, Plan 3 always satisfies the 
increase of biomass, being more resilient and flexible in this case. For this reason, Table 3 only includes Plans 1 and 
2.

Analyzing the overall results, we can see that Plan 1 cannot fulfill the demand if there is a demand increase before 
period 7. Nevertheless, if the raise happens at period 9 in power plant 3, demand is always met regardless of the 
increasing percentage. For Plan 2, if the increase is 20% and occurs in one of the first four months affecting power 
plant 1, the demand is not fulfilled. If the growth is 15%, it can only fulfil the raise for the first two months of the 
planning horizon. Finally, the plan is feasible if the increase is 10%, except if this increase occurs in the first month. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The main objective of this work was to develop a simulation-based methodology capable of estimating the impacts of 
disruptive events in a biomass supply chain (that forms, in fact, a network). After defining the main features of the 
network, a simulation model was built that includes dashboards to visualize KPIs and cost breakdowns, to support the 
analysis and decision-making processes. The implementation of “intermediate nodes” aims at facilitating the 
management of biomass stocks. Moreover, using these warehouses will help the biomass supply chain be more flexible 
to disruptive events.  
 
The dashboards added value to the system developed, providing supply chain managers with information about the 
cost structure and main KPIs in a visual format and easy to understand. The simulation model helped portray the 
results of the theoretical optimisation model by representing the system over time and evaluating stochastic scenarios 
with uncertainty, much representative of reality. In this work, three different plans (produced by a previously 
developed optimization model) are tested and compared in terms of the robustness of the supply chain. 
 
 
Regarding the plan performance, Plan 2 seems to be more prepared for the fire scenario justified by the usage of 
chipper 3 (higher processing power) instead of 2. Plan 3 has shown to be more suitable for the demand increase 
1910","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

scenario because the chippers are always located at the intermediate warehouses, ready to process. Focusing on the 
fire period, as closer it occurs to the end of the horizon, the success rate tends to decrease since there is less time to 
process all the extra biomass. Furthermore, in terms of demand increase month, as it approaches the end of the horizon, 
the success rate tends to increase, justified by the biomass already in the intermediate warehouses able to correspond 
to the increment. 
 
In terms of overall conclusions, the framework developed in this work seems able to support the assessment and 
selection of operational plans, taking into account the occurrence of disruptions in a biomass supply chain.  The 
framework also provides insights about the cost breakdown, the number of overtime work, number of deployments, 
or quantity of biomass not delivered or processed.  
 
The proposed simulation-based methodology was developed for the forest-to-bioenergy sector. However, the 
performed experiments show it is possible to replicate the methodology in terms of network setup and develop new 
simulation models for other sectors. Future studies could be conducted to validate this methodology in other industries 
and for different types of uncertainty such as breakdowns, machine deterioration, and transport delays. On the other 
hand, it would be interesting to integrate other constraints such as perishability, penalties for unsatisfied deliveries, 
and the time it takes for the supply chain to recover from different types of disruptions, through higher levels of 
resilience. Finally, it would also be essential to include a new study on the robustness of the model considering the 
decision makers’ risk attitude.

Abstract 
Today, competition between supply chains occurs and the existence of SMEs as one of the players in the supply chain 
cannot be ruled out. In order to win the competition, all supply chain players must have the same direction and 
objectives. Lean-Green and Sustainability practices have been applied to large companies and provide benefits. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies have addressed Lean-Green and Sustainability 
practices in the SME context. The literature review found that there is a lack of comprehensive empirical research 
studies investigating the impact of Lean-Green practices on the sustainability performance of SME supply chains. 
Thus, this paper proposes a conceptual model that is expected to provide an overview of the Lean-Green concept and 
the sustainability of the SME supply chain for further empirical study in developing deeper knowledge about these 
two practices.

1. Introduction
Recently, research in the supply chain management field has tended to incorporate the context of sustainability into 
business practices. The Brundtland commission's definition of the term “sustainability” is widely recognized. They 
stated it is a development to meet the needs of the present generation without neglecting the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. This definition emphasizes the distinction between “need” and “limitation”, 
where the limitations of the environment to meet current and future needs (WCED  1987). 
In general, the term “sustainability” is related to a quality to maintain the environment and its main focus is the 
environment. However, in some literature, sustainability is explained in three dimensions or pillars, namely: planet 
(environment), people (social) and profit (economy), which was later popularized as a triple bottom line (3BL) 
(Elkington  1994). In simple terms, sustainability can be achieved by balancing the 3BL. The environmental aspect 
seeks to improve human welfare by conserving the source of raw materials used to meet needs. Environmental 
preservation is carried out by controlling waste and the use of resources to prevent damage to humans. For 
manufacturing companies, the typical issues are reducing the use of materials and energy, as well as the resulting 
waste and pollution. The social aspect tries to get justice in getting welfare, education, health and safety at work 
(Gualandris et al.  2014; M.P. et al.  2017). The economic aspect focuses on securing short and long term profitability 
and the economic viability of the company (Reich-Weiser et al.  2008; Resta et al.  2016).  
Companies focus on only one or two of these 3BL will be feasible in the short term, but if they are to succeed in the 
long term they must balance economic performance (profit) with protecting the environment (planet) and improving 
social welfare (people) (Bai et al.  2012). This is due to government regulations, high competition, and public pressure 
that requires companies to balance their sustainability performance which includes all three aspects of the 3BL

Abstract 
The healthcare industry in Thailand has two main sectors: the government and the private sector. The private hospitals 
focus on providing service quality; it makes the customer satisfaction at high level. As a result, it leads the number 
and income of private hospitals to increase continuously. Therefore, private hospitals focus on improving both 
financial and non-financial strategies. 
For the products, they are the main drivers of the healthcare business which are medicines and medical supplies; both 
types of products have different handling complexities. For the safety of the patient's life and a competitive advantage, 
therefore, it is necessary to manage such products effectively and appropriately. This research aimed to develop 
operational guidelines and inventory strategies including the development and prioritization of indicators for 
measurement of product performance accurately. This research uses data from directly interview with private hospital 
experts. For the beginning, it started by reviewing SCM indicators, applying them to the BSC perspective, then 
prioritizing the BSC perspective and sequence of the performance indicators within each viewpoint. The method of 
hierarchical analysis (AHP) is applied in both quantitative and qualitative integration which is under the complex 
context of the SCM system to be able to bring conclusions or strategies to practices. It was conducted through a 
literature review and confirmed through questionnaires with experts from private hospitals in Thailand. The study 
found that the most important management aspect is the financial perspective. The most important inventory 
management performance measurement indicators are medication error, inventory turnover, and management cost.

1. Introduction
Generally, private and public hospitals clearly differ with some contexts or even characteristics. For the classification 
of hospitals, they lead to different goals and strategies of the organization for ownership and funding sources 
(Krichanchai and MacCarthy 2016) (Ouédraogo et al. 2020). Private hospitals focus on providing high-quality services 
and customer satisfaction, which is an important part. As public hospitals emphasize standards and easily accessible 
so that, private hospitals compete under management with high costs and service fees for competitive advantages 
(Kaya et al. 2020) (Swain 2019). However, both types of hospitals have common processes or goals to emphasize 
patients’ safety as a top priority (Rodríguez and Svensson 2020). 
In Thailand, the number of private hospitals is increasing steadily in each year because there are more service users, 
both Thai and foreign patients. As the number of patients increases, the hospital's income also increases greatly

For customer perspective, the total overview and the hospitals that managed inventory by themselves (In-house) and 
the hospitals that were managed by third-party logistics provider focused on the same indicator, which is picking error 
(Med error). 
 
For internal process perspective, total overview, the hospitals that managed inventory by themselves (In-house) and 
the hospitals that were managed by third-party logistics provider focused on the same indicator, which is stock 
accuracy. 
 
For learning and growth perspective, total overview and the hospitals that managed inventory by themselves (In-
house) and the hospitals that were managed by third-party logistics provider focused on the same indicator, which is 
stock nearly expired. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Private hospitals are business entities that are owned by individuals or groups by management budgets and expenses 
by themselves; there is no government budget to help support them. Therefore, private hospitals try to develop their 
potential to have the best medical care and service systems to be able to compete in the market, which is the main goal 
is profit and user safety. The main product is the driving force to achieve the goals of private hospitals which are 
medicine and medical supplies. However, there is a tendency to increase continuously both the number and revenue 
of the hospital which demonstrate the efficiency and value that customers choose to use the service. 
 
This paper surveys the top 10 private hospitals listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), which emphasizes 
the need to develop inventory management performance indicators to suit the context of each product category, e.g. 
medicines, pharmaceuticals, operation room, and x-rays in order to assess and manage to achieve the organization's 
goals effectively. This document is considered one of the priorities and practices of the BSC theory applied policy, 
which has developed and organized the prioritization of inventory management performance indicators in the medical 
supplies group to be practical on the policy of perspectives linked to a set of indicators. 
 
The results of the inventory management performance indicators focus on a financial perspective that follows the 
principle of BSC. However, the performance indicators focus on the customer, which emphasizes the highest safety 
of customers. From this point of view, this is consistent with the context and management practices of private hospitals 
that attach great importance to income and financial statements to increase the credibility of shareholders and 
customers. 
 
This set of inventory performance indicators can help government and non-governmental organizations interested in 
the development of SCM and Logistics to apply them to the real benefits and results in the form of financial and non-
financial. However, it is important to realize the goals of the organization to be able to adjust the agency's strategy 
appropriately and another thing is effective cooperation and communication with external organizations. 
 
This research has the scope of the development of the indicator set in private hospitals only to get a more 
comprehensive view or to be able to analyze the results in practice. It would be better to apply it to both public and 
private hospitals. Therefore, it will be interesting for future research to develop a set of indicators for the healthcare 
industry at all levels, including the manufacturing industry and pharmaceutical distribution as well. Another important 
thing is that before applying the set of indicators from this research, the organization or agency must be a tool or 
channel in order to collect and retrieve data for analysis properly.

Abstract 
With the outbreak of the new coronavirus (Covid-19), many countries adapted mandatory mask policies to curb the 
spread of the virus. Even if some countries start to loosen the disposable mask requirements, mask policies are still 
mandatory at least during transportation and people are highly recommended to wear them in public spaces. Due to 
all these preventive mask policies, the demand for medical face masks has increased tremendously, and mask 
manufacturers began to take orders for varying types of masks in large quantities that have to be fulfilled within a 
short response time. Thus, it is significant for the manufacturer to schedule medical face mask production tasks as 
efficiently as possible. In this paper, disposable medical face mask production planning is studied when the orders 
have different release dates, due dates, and set-up times. The problem studied in this paper is motivated from a real-
life mask manufacturer and a flow shop production scheduling problem is formulated with sequent two machines and 
set-up times while minimizing the total tardiness. A simulated annealing heuristic is proposed to solve this problem 
and we conclude that applying a simulated annealing heuristic results in a fast and efficient production plan.

1. Introduction
After the coronavirus first appeared in China in 2019, there was a rapid increase in cases and spread all over the world. 
With the outbreak of the Covid- 19, the disposable medical mask has become a basic need and the amount of demand 
has increased day by day. Since masks are the key measure for protection from viruses, reducing transmission, and 
saving lives. Due to the filtration feature of the disposable medical mask, WHO recommended disposable medical 
masks, not only for those who are sick due to Covid-19 but also for those who feel the symptoms, are in the community 
and are over 60 age (WHO   2022). Hence, many countries have made it mandatory to wear masks to reduce or even 
prevent the spread of Covid19. For example, while in Italy, Germany, Australia, Brazil, and the UK wearing mask is 
required in certain spaces or regions, in Spain, France, India, and  
Philippines wearing mask is required in public nationwide (Felter and Bussemaker  2020).  Even the recommendations 
may vary according to countries, still many people are expected to continue wearing masks.  Consequently, mask 
manufacturers began to take orders continuously for masks in large quantities that have to be fulfilled within a short 
response time. Thus, the mask manufacturers need  good production planning and scheduling that will avoid any 
delays. However, there are different types of masks with varying fabric, ear loops, and packaging, complicating 
problems as producing different types of masks requires set-up times. 
We are motivated from a real-life mask manufacturer and formulate its production process via a flow shop problem 
with two machines. This manufacturer receives multiple orders with varying release dates and due dates. Due to 
varying requirements of each order, set-up time is spent, such as time spent due to fabric changes between orders. The 
objective is to minimize the total tardiness. The two-machine flow-shop problem with total tardiness as the scheduling 
criterion is shown to be NP-complete. A simulated annealing (SA) heuristic is proposed to overcome this

5.2 Robustness due to Due Date 
The manufacturer may ask a due date delay due to their busy production plan or the customers may run out of masks 
hence they may need their orders earlier than they planned. Thus, the next question is to check the robustness of 
production planning with respect to due dates. The changes in the production plan due to the decreases (and the 
increases) in the due dates by 10% are analyzed. Table 7 shows the objective function values for the case when the 
due dates are decreased by 10%, whereas Table 8 shows the objective function values for the case when the due dates 
are increased by 10%. When the due dates are decreased by 10%, more orders become tardy contributing to the total 
tardiness objective function resulting in a higher increase of the objective function more than 10%. When the due 
dates are increased by 10%, some orders are not tardy anymore resulting in a higher decrease than 10%. It is 
recommended for the manufacturer to check the outcomes of such changes to define their robustness.

Conclusion 
In this paper, the production scheduling problem of disposable medical face masks is studied. The manufacturer 
receives many orders with varying release dates and due dates. We formulate a flow shop production scheduling 
problem with sequent two machines while minimizing the total tardiness This problem is motivated from a real-life 
mask manufacturer. A constructive heuristic, first improvement heuristic, and Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristics 
are proposed, and computational analysis is performed over real-life instances that are generated from the real medical 
face mask manufacturer.  
According to our numerical results, SA outperformed other heuristic methods. We even try different parameters while 
applying SA and show a certain set of parameters results in better objective function values. The questions of whether 
negotiating with customers to divide their large orders into two equally sized, smaller orders are good or what happens 
when the due dates are decreased/increased are answered. Studying parallel machines during production, alternative 
objective functions, such as minimizing the makespan, and sequence-dependent setup times are possible future 
extensions.

Abstract 
The necessary focus on sustainability issues, especially concerning tertiary engineering education at universities, has 
increased massively in recent years. On the one hand, the European Commission aims at a long-term examination of 
sustainability concepts and concrete implementation measures (e.g., Agenda 2030) with concrete initiatives (e.g., 
Green Deal. On the other hand, there is also a need for reform in the education system to equip the engineers of 
tomorrow with the necessary competencies for the use and implementation of these measures. This paper presents a 
model curriculum for a postgraduate master's programme on circular economy in the extractive industry based on a 
curriculum search and primary data collection in the extractive industry.

1. Introduction
Since 2011, many initiatives have been undertaken that helped shape policy and activities for the “European Circular 
Economy Action Plan” (CEAP) [1]. Under the direction of the Von der Leyen Commission in 2019, they revealed the 
“European Green Deal”, an ambitious plan to help turn the EU economy into a more sustainable and fairer one. In 
March 2020, the new CEAP was launched as a major contributing keystone of the European Green Deal [2]. The need 
for transformation derives from the necessity to rely less on imported and virgin raw materials, reduce global market 
price dependencies, and stimulate new business opportunities and innovation. The action plan supported 
transformation by engaging policymakers throughout Europe for the promotion of systematic change. 
Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) play a vital role in systematic change as they are a contributing factor to the 
understanding and dissemination of sustainable development through the production and diffusion of competencies, 
i.e. knowledge, skills, and attitude [3]. For a true greener economy, all disciplines in higher education need to
understand their role in helping the EU to reach and sustain policy initiatives [4,5]. The importance of engineering
addressing sustainable development (SD) has been pointed out by international organizations, such as the World
Federation of Engineering Organizations [6,7]the International Federation of Consulting Engineers [8], and the
UNESCO Engineering Initiative [9].
Bearing in mind the roles HEIs in the engineering education field can play towards embedding systematic change for 
a greener economy, the gap between current education offers and industry requirements needs to be examined to meet 
the demands set down by policies for the circular economy and to equip graduates with state-of-the-art competencies 
to achieve and contribute to a more sustainable and fairer European economy.

shall be considered as far as possible. 
 
6.5 Language of instruction 
The language of instruction is English. If possible, all modules/examinations can also be held in popular European 
language courses, based on the nationality composition of the participants. Courses, examinations, and written work 
can also be held or written in the native language, as well as, in English as the common scientific language. 
 
7. Conclusion 
In a nutshell, it can be stated that the basic concepts and associated measures of the circular economy are indispensable 
for the sustainable use of resources, such as human capital or raw materials. The results of the primary data collection 
show how necessary the holistic integration of these topics is in current curricula and training at the tertiary education 
level. Here, the integration of the concepts and measures of the circular economy into all courses, as a multidisciplinary 
approach, seems to be successful to be able to further develop both the professional and the transversal competences 
of future engineers. This postgraduate model curriculum primarily serves as a model for the participating universities 
to implement such master's programmes in the university landscape. The implementation of this master's programme 
is planned for 2023 and will be implemented with the partner universities of the CIRCEXTIN project. For the long-
term further development of the postgraduate master's programme, further studies or surveys in the knowledge 
triangle, education, research, and business are of course essential to be able to guarantee current topics and challenges 
as well as competence-oriented methods and techniques for successful teaching and learning.

Abstract 
The purpose of the study was to assess waste and propose countermeasures to simplify the account opening process 
at a bank in Kuwait. The study uses a case study approach to analyze the process and therefore recommends some 
lean solutions to simplify the process. To solve this problem, five groups of five students were formed. These groups 
recommend various lean strategies and guidance that can help banks improve their processes. The study identified 
multiple sources of waste, including overproduction, overprocessing, excessive motions, underutilized skills and long 
wait times. To improve the process, the groups came up with several lean tools such as 5s, poka-yoke, andon, and 
visual management,  that could reduce processing time by about 30 percent. These solutions were recently adopted by 
banks, which confirmed the applicability of lean tools in Kuwait banks, and validated that the solutions proposed by 
the students also confirmed that lean is a sound approach, as long as they have the mindset. To the best of our 
knowledge, there are very few studies on lean systems in the suburbs of Kuwait, and this is only the second study to 
use lean tools and techniques to analyze and improve banking processes in Kuwait.

Abstract 
Recent fire incidents have caught the attention of authorities, engineers, architects, and other stakeholders in the 
construction industry regarding the application of aluminum composite panels. Major high-rise buildings worldwide 
have experienced fire incidents associated with aluminum composite panels necessitating research in regulatory 
requirements. The UK, the UAE, France, Australia, and South Korea are countries whose high-rise buildings have 
experienced fire incidents associated with fire spreading through ACPs. An investigation of specific incidents revealed 
substantial fire spread by ACPs, leading to losses. Aluminum composite panels are a group of sandwich panels that 
have hardwired applications in the construction industry in the last three decades. This research identifies glaring gaps 
in the regulatory framework for applying aluminum composite panels in the construction of high-rise buildings. It 
investigates the contribution of gaps in the regulatory framework today regarding safety and fire incidents associated 
with ACPs in different countries. After ascertaining the gaps, the research makes appropriate recommendations for 
the safe application of ACPs in the construction industry.

1. Introduction
Advancements in technology a call for continuous discovering and development of new and versatile building and 
construction materials. The newly developed materials are usually compatible with traditional building and 
construction materials while being used in different construction systems and buildings. The versatility and flexibility 
in emerging construction materials influence evolution in architectural thinking. Furthermore, the emerging materials 
impact the architectural field by modifying the environment, aesthetic, political, and cultural aspects of construction 
and building. Aluminum composite planes (ACP) emerged in the architectural field to influence material selection 
based on building characteristics such as shape, size, and geographical location. ACP materials fulfill architectural 
characteristics such as building shape, location, setting, construction and building methods. The supply of ACP 
materials comes with different characteristics and flexibility in architectural designs and implementation.  ACP 
materials impact on the construction industry manifests through high-speed automated implementation and the 
emergence of modern construction systems. Thus, ACP's impact on the construction industry renders it critical in the 
current and future designs and construction, warranting an extensive examination to ascertain its characteristics, 
advantages, and limitations.

6. Conclusion
Incidents of the Torch Tower (UAE), Grenfell Tower (UK) and others trigger the urge to review the existing regulatory 
framework in UAE's ACP materials and the fundamental safety requirements of the building and construction industry. 
A specific focus on the external facade system and ACP insulation is necessary for the UAE material requirements. 
The nature of fire spread with ACP cladding materials containing combustible core materials raises concern over the 
safety of building occupants and firefighters. Consequently, the UAE should implement new regulations in the fire 
and life safety code of 2018 to control ACP production quality and undertake tests and inspections during installation 
and maintenance. Focus on local and international manufacturers, and third-party certification is essential to enforce 
compliance and ensure reliability. Authorities should adopt a consistent certification criterion for local and 
international manufacturers to eliminate possible loopholes for non-compliance.

Abstract 
In the era of data science and big data analytics, HR analytics can help organizations and their human resources (HR) 
managers to predict reason behind the employee exits and reduce attrition rate and employee turnover at an early stage. 
Organization invests lot of time and money in hiring and training their workforce. Thus, when they leave the job, the 
reduction of cost of capital is borne by the company. In this context, employee turnover presents a serious problem 
and a big peril for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity.  To overcome 
this, HR Analytics is the most important tool for organization to gain insights out of big data, collected from different 
sources (e.g. public social media, enterprise social media, Internet of Things etc.) to reduce employee turnover. From 
static to descriptive, descriptive to diagnostic, diagnostic to predictive, predictive to prescriptive type of HR analytics 
has come a long way.  
This research attempts to explore that organization apply different types of HR Analytics in different business strategy 
firms, with/ without the use of social media / enterprise social media (ESM) for the prediction of employee turnover. 
(Porter 1980) competitive business strategy includes cost leadership (CL) strategy, differentiator (DIFF) strategy and 
focus. By using statistical test chi-square, we conclude that there is significant difference between various strategy 
types and types of HR Analytics used in the organization for prediction of employee turnover with the use of ESM.

Introduction 
The phenomenon of employees leaving the company is referred to as employee turnover, employee attrition, and churn 
rate. When employee leaves the organization, type of attrition depends on how they are leaving involuntary or 
voluntary or after retirement (McQuerrey 2019).Voluntary attrition is caused by the employees’ who owns their 
decision to leave a company. While in involuntary attrition, a company might have to reduce workforce or replace the 
employee.  
Employee turnover is a major worry for businesses, especially in today's competitive climate, when people are the 
most valuable asset. Depending on how difficult it is to fill the employees’ role (Sesil 2013), the cost of voluntary 
employee churn can range from 1.5 to 5 times the employee's annual salary. However, because the loss of one person 
may have an impact on ongoing projects or services, this is only a small part of the entire cost to a business. It could, 
for example, cause customer and other stakeholder unhappy (Saradhi and Palshikar 2011). It could result in the loss 
of a company's network or other critical information, especially if an experienced long-term employee leaves. It may 
also have an impact on other employees, who must cover the task of the individual who has left the company.

Abstract 
The construction sector encounters significant obstacles in its shift to sustainable practices and the adoption of building 
information modeling (BIM) technologies. In the context of the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates has made 
significant efforts to integrate BIM into sustainable construction, which is utilized to advance procedures and has 
gotten extensive action in the literature worldwide. However, some cases in the UAE have taken advantage of this 
essential synergy between BIM and sustainable practices, while many others have remained on the sidelines, unable 
to realize the potential of BIM in sustainable initiatives fully. This paper aims to investigate the challenges and barriers 
faced in integrating BIM and sustainable practice in the UAE construction industry. An extensive literature review is 
conducted to define the main barriers that are used in designing the survey. The survey was distributed among different 
parties in the UAE construction industry. After data collection, data analysis took place using the AHP (Analytic 
Hierarchy Process) technique. Statistical tests were exploited for data analysis and used to elaborate and validate 
results. This kind of analysis study has been conducted in other developed countries like UK and USA; however, no 
such study has been done in UAE. The findings revealed that technological and financial factors are the main barriers 
to implementing BIM in the UAE. The research findings and suggested mitigation plan will facilitate the BIM adoption 
and integration in sustainable construction projects, allowing decision-makers to address the critical problems and 
barriers outlined in this study.

Abstract 
Since the launch of Industry 4.0 in 2011, its understanding has been driving science and business, and in the case of 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with increasing intensity. That Industry 4.0 is not just a simple 
transformation and demands immense efforts from companies to implement it, is demonstrated not only by scientific 
publications, but also by numerous patents/products and editorials in journals. Maturity models (MMs) and readiness 
models (RMs) for Industry 4.0 are a frequently chosen issue to approach the topic (of implementation). In this paper, 
based on a structured literature review, 78 models were identified and analyzed, resulting in a set of recommendations 
for the application of those models by SMEs. Theoretically, this paper contributes to increase knowledge in the area 
of digitalization, compiling and classifying the different models to support the digital transition. This paper may help

1. Introduction
The 2011 Hannover Messe classified the industrial age into Industry 3.0 and Industry 4.0. Since then, science and 
industry have been trying to give the term structure, define and delimit it (Dikhanbayeva et al. 2020; Schumacher et 
al. 2016). The focus is on new components or components applied in new constellations, such as big data and analytics 
(BD/BDA), Internet of things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS), (Kumar et al. 2020). These form a network 
all-round exchange of data, which is not only limited to the technical aspects, but also includes management, strategy, 
innovation, culture & organizational aspects (Ganzarain & Errasti  2016; Yue et al. 2019).  
Industry 4.0 vision forces real-time multilateral communication between CPS and humans as autonomous, self-
optimizing and intelligent processes (Santos & Martinho 2019; Schuh et al. 2017). However, entering this new world 
requires new ways of thinking in companies, as it means moving away from traditional production structures that 
focus primarily on reducing manufacturing costs and time to market (Lin et al. 2020). These new approaches often 
have not yet been truly understood by companies (Krowas & Riedel  2019). According to Rauch et al. (2019), entering 
Industry 4.0 world is particularly challenging for SMEs, where major barriers such as high investment costs in high-
end software (Li & Lau  2019) and the lack of IT and engineering professionals (Mittal et al. 2018) among others, 
must be overcome. Although SMEs account for over 90% of companies in many countries (European Commission,

1. Introduction / Background
A scientific core of an important activity known as risk assessment, which is used for the evaluation of potential 
sequences (Faustman and Omenn 2008). Risk assessment has become a dominant public policy tool for making 
choices, based on limited resources (Council 2009). Risk assessment and management was established as a 
scientific field some 30–40 years Risk assessment and management was established as a scientific field some 30–
40 years (Aven  2016).  
Risk assessment of financial intermediaries is an area of renewed interest due to the financial crises of the 1980’s 
and 90’s (Galindo and Tamayo  2000). After 2007–2008 crisis, it is clear that corporate credit scoring is becoming 
a key role in credit risk management (Luo, et al. 2017).  Consumer credit scoring is often considered a 
classification task where clients receive either a good or a bad credit status (Kruppa  et al. 2013). In this regard 
(Sun and Vasarhalyi 2021) develop a prediction system to help the credit card issuer model the credit card 
delinquency risk. Credit card is getting increasingly more famous in budgetary exchanges, simultaneously frauds 
are likewise expanding (Almuteer  et al. 2021).

Abstract 
Assessing the performance of intralogistics operations and real-time process optimization in manufacturing and 
warehouse facilities are crucial for promoting lean manufacturing in the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) 
context. Excessive travelling, out-of-schedule activities for picking, and inefficient routing are just shortfalls that 
should be optimized with the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools. The Internet of Things 
(IoT) provides technical solutions for monitoring the movement of assets at the facilities, and the development of 
sophisticated software tools enables the monitoring of intralogistics operations. This research contributes to the digital 
transformation of intralogistics operations and the interconnection with the physical world using ICT and Business 
Process Management tools. Specifically, the proposed framework analyzes how real-time locating systems can 
positively impact critical manufacturing flows: i) material; ii) process; and iii) information. Furthermore, the 
framework enhances transparency and sustainability. From the perspective of transparency, it interconnects the 
physical world and the processes of the company while focusing on the sustainability of the social, environmental, 
and economic dimensions. The social dimension is enhanced by creating a safer working environment for the 
employees while the environmental and economical dimensions are enhanced by minimizing the travelling distance 
of the moving vehicles and therefore the total energy consumption.

1. Introduction
Internet of Things (IoT) has provided a promising opportunity to build powerful industrial systems and applications 
by leveraging the growing ubiquity of radio-frequency identification (RFID), and wireless, mobile, and sensor devices 
(Xu et al., 2014). The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is an innovative technology that accelerates the digital 
transformation in industries. During the fourth industrial revolution businesses changed dramatically from the 
perspective of information. While the third revolution focused on introducing automation in industries the fourth 
industrial revolution seeks new ways to optimize the processes in order to bust competitiveness. The goals of Industry

needs to release the part at the “Ready products” awaiting area. Also, in the Figure 6b there is a false identification of 
the employee’s activity as the initial point of the employee at the start of the simulation was at the machine 1 position 
and the algorithm recognized it as a process at Machine 1. 
For the calculation of the resource utilization, a comparison table between the reported results from the algorithm and 
the AnyLogic software is represented. As the AnyLogic software does not provide the utilization percentages about 
the identified sub-processes, in the case of the employee the summation of the three processes was used for the 
calculation of the utilization. As a result, we observed a difference of 4.41% for the utilization of the AGV and a 
difference of 2.54% for the utilization of the employee. Thus, the results show that the calculations from the developed 
algorithm based on the RTLS provides acceptable metrics with an added value on the utilization of the resources that 
are being tracked. Considering that the proposed algorithm is using only the positioning data without any other 
information we conclude that the accuracy is at a high level in comparison with the AnyLogic software which 
calculates the utilization of the resources based on real-time resource’s data which are not available in real-world 
industrial facilities.

Finally, a last comparison about the total travelled distance that the proposed algorithm provides and the actual 
travelled distance that AnyLogic calculates is presented on Table 2. The distances on the proposed algorithm were 
calculated based on the Transportation Activity diagrams from Figure 5 and 6a. The estimations show that even 
without the movement activities inside the manufacturing cell (case of the employee) and the AGV standby area (case 
of AGV) the algorithm was able to estimate the travelled distance with high accuracy.

From all the above results we conclude that the RTLS provides crucial information about Business Process 
Management. In our case through that information the business administration layer could be able to identify the 
processes and readjust the industrial facility layout in order to move these processes closer to each other and maximize 
the resource utilization. Moreover, the minimization of the transportation activities could be achieved. 
5. Conclusion
The road map towards the smart factories of the future includes new challenges for industries as well as for young 
engineers. While the primary aim of Industry 4.0 is the development of fully automated processes this accomplishment 
is still a far-reaching target for most of the industries. Information Technology Tools provide a basis for enhancing 
industrial activities. This research work proposes an algorithm that extracts crucial information about the operational 
processes of assets in a facility layout. Through a simulation experiment we conclude that the algorithm can effectively 
use asset’s positioning data to extract information about resource utilization, total distance travelled, and the 
undertaken processes. Moreover, this tool prevents collisions and accidents between the tracking assets within the 
industrial area. As a conclusion, RTLS supports business process management on industries, especially by focusing 
on the business administration layer and by monitoring in real-time the ongoing activities in the industrial facility. 
As a future step, the authors will improve the classification capabilities of the proposed algorithm by including 
information about the layout of the facility. In this way, more information about the processes could be extracted as 
there is a connection among the positioning data and the industrial manufacturing cells. Moreover, an algorithm that 
creates metrics about the flows and the percentages that the asset spends in each one of them could be developed.

Finally, after the simulation, the algorithm should be tested in real-world scenarios and in numerous industrial facilities 
for the validation of the process extraction procedure.

Abstract 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is one of the valid models to analyze factors that influence the acceptance of 
technology information, utterly in hospitals. This study aimed to analyze factors that influence the acceptance of the 
Hospital Information System (HIS) by its staff owned by the Jambi Provincial Government. A cross-sectional 
quantitative study design chose its sites by purposive sampling with B-type hospitals criterion owned by Jambi 
Provincial Government, namely Raden Mattaher District Hospital and H. Hanafie District Hospital, in 2019. 
Population and sample were selected hospital staff based on a purposive sampling of as many as 104 respondents. 
Factors that can affect HIS acceptance based on TAM theory are the perception of convenience and utility and 
motivation’s staff. Data analysis using version 23 SPSS software, Chi-square analysis to obtain the significance of 
factors and logistic regression to determine dominance factor. Results showed that the three factors affect significantly 
HIS acceptance for hospital staff, with OR=5 and p-value=0.003 for ease of use perception, OR=9.8 and p-
value=0.003 for usefulness perception, OR=3.4 and p-value=0.04 for staff’s motivation. At the same time, the most 
dominant factor that influences HIS acceptance where evaluated HIS was easy to use for staff would be accepted 
10.46 times compared to hard one. Emphasizing the convenience aspect of applying HIS to support the work and 
performance of staff was urgent for hospital management and Jambi Provincial Government.

The usefulness of technology for a person in supporting their performance is also no less decisive for a person to 
receive a system or information technology. Several research results support the findings of this study, which states 
that the usefulness of technology in helping work become easier, increase productivity, increase effectiveness and 
develop a person's performance will determine the acceptance of the technology and determine the intensity of use 
(Eki and Misfariyan  2015; Alipour et al. 2016; Kusumawati and Sulistyawati 2018).   
 
5. Proposed Improvements  
Understanding the determinants of the acceptance of health workers in the use of the HIS is an important thing to do. 
The factors of ease, usefulness and motivation of officers are factors that have been proven to determine acceptance. 
However, emphasizing the convenience aspect of applying HIS to support the work and performance of staff is an 
urgent matter for the development of HIS technology in hospitals in Jambi Province.  
 
6.  Validation  
Validity and reliability tests were carried out on 30 respondents, so that the table r value used a degree of freedom 
(value df=n-2=30-2=28), at a meaningfulness level of 5% which was 0.361. Meanwhile, for reliability, by comparing 
r the result in the form of an Alpha value, with the provision that if the value of r Alpha> r of the table, then the 
question is reliable. The validity and reliability test of the questionnaire for independent variable to 3 indicators of the 
TAM model (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and motivation) was measured through 15 questions, and 4 
questions for dependent variable with the result of the validity test i.e. the value of r result (0.362-0.687) is greater 
than r table (r=0.361), so it can be concluded that the statement is declared valid. For reliability, the test results show 
the value of r Alpha (0.749) is greater than the r of the table (0.361) so the statement is declared reliable.  
 
Conclusion  
HIS is an important part of providing accurate and valid data to support decision-making by health workers in 
providing health services, while also being important for management in making policies. Challenges in the use of 
HIS technology can be answered by studying the factors that determine the acceptance of the technology. The study 
found that the ease of technology, usefulness and motivation of officers will determine the acceptance of HIS 
technology by health officers in hospitals. The dominant factor is the ease of HIS technology where HIS technology 
which is considered easy will increase the acceptance of officers by 10 times compared to HIS technology which is 
considered difficult. At the same time, the most dominant factor that influences HIS convenience perception, where 
evaluated HIS was easy to use for staff would be accepted 10.46 times compared to hard one. Emphasizing the 
convenience aspect of applying HIS to support the work and performance of staff was urgent for hospital management 
and Jambi Provincial Government.

Abstract 
Star Model is a framework for organization design and has been highlighted for its completeness and holistic 
perspective. Star Model has also been adapted to Project-Based Organizations' (PBO) design. Some researchers have 
chosen this guideline considering the connections and interdependence between its five components: Strategy, 
Process, Rewards, Human Resources and Structure. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no quantitative 
viewpoint about these connections in the literature yet. In this paper, the interconnections between the Star Models' 
components are modelled, measured, and analyzed using the Network Analysis (NA) tool. NA is a technique that 
predicts the structure of the relationships between entities and uses graph theory to deploy its connections through 
mathematical indicators. The results confirm that all Star Model components are linked effectively, although at 
different levels, and that some components are the bridge for maintaining their relationships. This research seeks to 
provide a management tool for project managers and organizational analysts, giving quantitative support for effective 
organizational design and implementation.

1. Introduction
Organization design focuses on the different organizational forms, strategic choices for managers and the external and 
internal factors affecting them (Miterev   et al.  2017). Oganizational design has also been studied to improve business 
performance (Rovelli and Butticè  2020). In this context, Project-Based Organizations (PBOs) are organizations in 
which projects are the main business process for coordinating and integrating their business functions (Loufrani-
Fedida et al.  2015). The study of PBO has received attention from researchers during the last ten years (Cattani et al., 
2011) and from different study perspectives. For instance, the continuous improvement of PBO (Backlund and 
Sundqvist  2018), the information technologies that support the project management into a PBO (Abrante and

On the other hand, the value of the average path length indicates that each node requires 3,486 paths to meet the other 
node. Modularity indicates the level of connections between nodes conforming to a cluster. Considering a maximum 
value of 1, the value of 0,81 shows a high density of connections into a cluster.

1. Conclusions 
The main reason for the Star Model's choice as a framework for PBO is the wide coverage of dimensions (five 
components) and their interrelation. This framework has been modelled, measured and analyzed in this article. It has 
been verified that all components of the Star Model compose a network, and their components are connected. 
However, it can be seen that some components are not directly connected and are only linked through a bridge 
represented by the strategy component, which allows the whole network's interrelation. Moreover, the connections 
that allow the relationships between the strategy component and others were identified. The results of the present 
analysis reaffirm the importance of the strategy for this framework and how this component gives the guidelines for 
the whole organization. 
Studying the intrinsic relationships between all nodes, 16 clusters are formed, mainly as a subdivision of a Star Model 
component. Although the model obtained presents a similar form to the model with labelled components, it confirms 
the concepts' closeness with its main Star Model's component. It can also be verified that some clusters cross the 
components sharing concepts. 
In general, the network is completely connected but has no strong cohesion. Some specific nodes are important for 
maintaining the relationship between Star Model components and work as a bridge through the strategy component. 
Some of these nodes are, for instance, the international organizational structure (from structure Star Models' 
component), goals (rewards), customer processes (process) and people practice and competencies (people). 
This paper seeks to be useful for organizational analysts and designers to facilizing the use of the Star Model as a 
guideline. On the one hand, the main concepts of this framework were modelled, and it is possible to navigate with a 
simple query in the Kumu.io© application used. On the other hand, the key connections of the Star Model components 
were identified, providing insights to the analysts so that these connections are effectively embodied in the 
organizational design to ensure complete interrelationship. The connection levels found in this work could be used as 
a reference level to measure the level of adherence to the Star Model as well as the level of interconnectedness of PBO 
components modelled. It can also be considered that a quantitative basis on a standard (such as PMBOK, for example) 
can help to build an organizational maturity model on some practice, such as OPM3 for organizational project 
management.

Future studies may be focused on finding implicit connections between the nodes, reveal new interdependencies, and 
increasing the degree of cohesion between the Star Model principles.

Abstract 
Star Model (SM) is a framework used for designing Project-Based Organizations (PBO) with a wide acceptance. Some 
researchers have chosen the SM considering its completeness, holistic perspective and the interdependence between 
its five components: Strategy, Process, Behaviour, Human Resources and Structure. For SM use and implementation, 
this framework is available as a text guideline. If the size and complexity of the designing and analyzing organization 
increases, this activity could be manual and difficult. Ontologies are a means for describing domain models and 
provide computational inference useful for the analysis of these models. This paper proposes an ontology of the SM 
for PBO designing, describing its components and relationships in a high level of abstraction. The resulting model 
seeks to be helpful for understanding and managing the complexity of the designed organization and a tool for business 
analysis—the above considering the automatic analysis possibilities available through the computational inference of 
ontologies.

Introduction 
Society is substantially projectified, and 40% of the economy is project-based (Miterev et al.  2017), and companies 
use projects to develop new products and achieve key capabilities (Pellegrinelli et al.  2015). In this context, a group 
of organizations obtains their income by developing projects. These organizations are known as Project-Based 
Organizations (PBO) (Di Vincenzo and Mascia  2012). The study of PBO has increased in the last years, and one of 
the main concerns is the PBO design (Miterev et al.  2017a). There are wide alternatives for organizational design; 
however, these tools focus on individual choices, such as people, structure, and processes (Miterev et al.  2017). The

Conclusions 
A Star Model framework ontology for organizational designing was developed in this research. Star Model has been 
highlighted in the literature for encompassing the main concerns of the organizational design: strategy, structure, 
processes, people and rewards. These components are displayed in a guideline in a text format, and computational 
tools and models could be useful for facilitating the designing process and analysis. Our proposal seeks to be a 
designing and managing tool for the Star Model implementation. The obtained ontology was developed using the 
METHONTOLOGY framework and displayed in the Protégé ontology editor. The modelling language using was 
evaluated using the Oops! Scanner tool and the Debugger tool of Protégé. The results show that the ontology has 
minor issues and, in general, the ontology is correctly modelled in terms of the language. Regarding the domain 
modelled, some statements of the Star Model were verified into the ontology with success. 
Future works can continue the modelling process, mapping other relationships that could be implicitly identifiable and 
with a domain's expert judgement. Also, the granularity of the ontology could be increased by identifying other 
subclasses. The modelling of a PBO with this ontology can be made as a practical application. Also, in a complex 
project environment, this ontology will be useful for establishing the projects' governance, standardizing roles, 
concerns, and competencies, and merging the ontology with other standards such as PMBOK or PRINCE.

Abstract 
Recent studies have proven that lighting conditions in the workplace play a vital role in employees’ satisfaction as 
well as their productivity, and health in general. Natural light is the main source of lighting in the workplace, and it’s 
very important for the employees to be exposed to it to a certain level in addition to the artificial ones. This paper 
reviews the important role of lighting in the workplace with regard to shedding light on natural lighting, how 
employees feel about it and about lighting in their offices in general, and whether it causes a certain health issue or 
not. This was done by surveying several employees from different companies and was supported by a correlation 
analysis study to study the relationship between the different parameters. An experiment was conducted to check if 
the employees were exposed to healthy and safe lighting in different locations depending on different parameters and 
indications such as lighting steadiness and distribution, and whether they faced common issues such as glare, lighting 
contrast, and flickering. New and old buildings have to incorporate natural light more into their structure. A review of 
possible solutions has been created and made for both with some innovative solutions.

1. Introduction
Huge efforts are made to make office environments as healthy and safe as possible to ensure the satisfaction of 
employees and maximize the performance of the company. Conditions such as lighting, temperature, ventilation, 
cleanliness and ergonomics are key indicators of the safety and comfort of any workplace. Lighting conditions play a 
huge role in this formula of safe workplaces. Poor lighting at work can cause health issues such as eye strain, headache 
and fatigue as well as low performance. In addition, too much light causes safety and health issues such as glare and 
stress which can lead to mistakes and lower the quality of work. Good lighting conditions reduce the risk of 
occupational accidents and health problems and increase concentration and accuracy of work. Artificial lighting is 
usually considered to be the dominant source of lighting in offices worldwide due to the reliability, wide range and 
options they provide. However, excessive use of artificial lighting with no natural lighting possesses a health risk to 
the employees. Lack of exposure to sunlight during working hours can be concerning especially over a long period of 
time. This paper reviews the health benefits of exposure to natural lighting in offices as well as comparing between 
the characteristics of artificial and natural light. In addition, the paper tests the importance of natural lighting along 
with assessing the lighting conditions in different office environments.

Lighting in existing buildings 
To increase exposure to natural lighting resources, many tools and technologies can be implemented and added to 
existing buildings. technologies and tools involve: 
  
● 
LightBox therapy (Dynamic lighting): This is a tool used to mimic the condition of outdoor light. They are 
used to treat people suffering from seasonal affective disorder (SAD). This technology can be more often 
available in the offices to be provided to the workers when needed. It causes a chemical change in the brain 
that lifts and enhances the mood’s quality. It can provide exposure to 10,000 lux of light. 
● 
Sky ceiling: We can use this technology to recreate real natural views of the world with a real window 
appearance in the ceiling of the rooms. 
● 
Light wall colors: Special types of paints also can be used that reflect the natural lighting in the best way. 
● 
Install smart lighting adjustment systems: These smart systems can help in adjusting the lighting conditions 
based on employees' preferences and the tasks being performed. 
 
Project limitations and further improvement  
There were some limitations in the study conducted to test the importance of natural lighting. The survey sample is 
relatively small. A larger sample could provide better results and correlations between the questions. In addition, 
improvements can be done to the experiment by testing other lighting-related measurements such as correlated color 
temperature, lighting direction, shadiness, and color rendering. Furthermore, the experiment can be further developed 
by matching the lighting conditions in NPCC to the health conditions of the employees. This can be done by using 
biological assessments such as blood tests, urine and saliva to test the hormone levels of the workers. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Studies have proven the importance of natural light and its effects on workers to increase productivity, and alertness, 
improving their mood, and overall mental and physical health. Our paper supported the high impacts of natural lighting 
on employees from various industries, with the survey results demonstrating a very good result in terms of studying 
the importance of having more access to natural lighting, its effects on employee satisfaction, and its impact on the 
overall performance of the workers. Moreover, lighting conditions, in general, have to be taken into companies' 
consideration in order to provide the best possible environment for their workers. The experiment was conducted to 
check if the lighting conditions in NPCC offices fall within the range of the recommended illuminance in office areas, 
and the results show that some areas such as the cubicle don’t have a good amount of lighting. They lack exposure to 
natural lighting. Our recommendations focus on providing the best possible lighting conditions using different tools 
and technologies in both the existing and new buildings. There were some constraints in the research that have been 
identified, they can be further addressed, and further actions can be taken in order to have more intensive and precise 
results.

Abstract 
Many industries face the challenge of coalescing economic development with a decrease in environmental burden that 
has brought more stress on life support systems, pushing the environmental impacts closer to the threshold limits of 
tolerance. Therefore, it is fundamental that the industrial system focuses on the consideration of the whole life cycle 
of the products, processes, infrastructures, and other industrial activities during the designing and restructuring of 
processes through Life Cycle Thinking (LCT). The theoretical and methodological aspects in research is reviewed in 
literature where Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to environmental management. LCA is a useful (though 
labour intensive) tool in analysing environmental benefits of synergies in an industrial system. Literature reveals that 
there is a need to research more on the possibility of LCA methods that are less complex especially in Inventory 
Analysis (IA). The methods should be affordable but giving reliable data that can be used for decision making. Another 
area of research is the development of a framework that is region specific especially in the African region considering 
that most tools used are European based.

1. Introduction
Industrialisation, a pivotal process of any country's economic development (Zafar et al. 2020) has been associated
with an altered environment as well as increased environmental impact. The challenge many industries face today is
to coalesce economic development with a decrease in environmental burden. The burden on the environment has
brought more stress on life support systems thus pushing the environmental impacts closer to the threshold limits of
tolerance (Bhandan & Garg  2016) (Patnaik 2018). These impacts include global warming, climate change,
diminishing natural resources and waste management. This calls for industries to be proactive in the design of new
products, improve those that exist and develop cleaner manufacturing processes as the world is moving towards a
Circular Economy (CE), a model where  resource use is improved by extracting minimal natural resources, reducing
waste generation through optimising, material environmental, social, and economic values throughout  a product’s life
cycle (Velenturf & Purnell  2021). In doing this, industries reduce raw material and energy consumption minimising
amount of waste generated thus increasing productivity and the organisation’s financial benefits in the long term
(Rankin  2014). Globally, environmentally responsible organisations are being incentivised as the market is
increasingly becoming interested in environmental issues as strategic variables in business (Mazzi  2020). Therefore,
it is fundamental that the industrial system focuses on methods that assess their processes and systems (Mazzi 2020).
This includes the consideration of the whole life cycles of the products, processes, infrastructures and other industrial
activities during the designing and restructuring or processes through Life Cycle Thinking as described on Figure 1.

LCA implementation provides information that can be used in a comprehensive decision-making process. Moreso 
application of LCA methodologies as well as engaging experts assist in identifying ecological impacts of a product or 
system. In line with sustainable Development goal 12, businesses need to comprehend the environmental and social 
effects of their system and products as well as their life cycles. Consequently, industry is obliged to identify hotspots 
within the value chain to come up with interventions to improve the system in line with the pillars of sustainability 
(Economic, Social and Environmental). Given the continued industrial evolution impacting on the environment, there 
is need for a deliberate and rational approach to maintain sustainability.  From an industrial ecology perspective, the 
application of LCA is useful (though labour intensive) in analysing environmental benefits of synergies in an 
environmental system as it is an ISO standardised tool that examines the impacts of a product or service throughout 
its life cycle.  
 
The reviewed literature revealed that a life cycle view should be considered which gives a better insight into the 
impacts of an industrial system. LCA has become widely recognised as an effective tool for assessing the resource 
consumption, environmental as well as and human health impacts connected with the complete life cycle of products, 
processes, and activities. The approach allows decision-makers to identify environmental areas of concern and 
enhance industrial systems without burden shifting. Initially LCA started as a strategy to compare the environmental 
friendliness of products but has evolved to a systemic, standardized tool for environmental sustainability in industry 
and government.  LCA methodologies, especially in the LCI phase, are so complicated, there is potential for new 
scientific findings and improvements.  
 
5. Suggestions for Future Research 
Life Cycle Assessment is a valuable decision-making, though labour-intensive tool in Environmental Management 
and sustainable development. Therefore, it is suggested that more research be done on the possibility of making LCA 
methods less complex and affordable but giving reliable data. Another area of research is the development of a 
framework that is region specific especially the African region considering that most tools used are from the European 
region. As a way of ensuring sustainability of LCA tools, monitoring and evaluation methodologies of the tools need 
to be explored.

Abstract 
Sustainable waste management practices, Resource Efficiency (RE) and Circular Economy (CE) strategies must be 
mainstreamed in policies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Zimbabwean constitution provides 
for environmental rights which include pollution and ecological degradation prevention, conservation promotion and 
encouraging ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while supporting economic and social 
development. It calls for the development of legislative and other measures for the protection of the environment. 
Considering this, the legislative framework of Zimbabwe includes the Principal Act which is the Environmental 
Management Act and its ancillary regulations. Regulations relevant to waste management include the Effluent and 
Solid Waste Disposal Regulations (SI 6, 2007). This instrument regulates the disposal of waste (solid waste and 
effluent), using the “polluter pays” principle but does not explicitly promote circularity as industry can budget for the 
disposal and not work towards circularity. Hazardous Waste Management Regulations (SI 10 2007) provides for the 
issuing of licenses for the generation, storage, use, recycling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of hazardous waste 
for waste generators and waste handlers. In addition, the country also has the Integrated Waste Management Plan 
published in 2014 that promotes integration of waste management practices.  
The legislative framework (policies, acts, regulations, and ancillary legislations) needs to be aligned to fully 
encompass sustainable practices in the management of industrial waste towards the transition to a CE. The policies 
were evaluated, analysed and interpreted for their implications on stakeholders by conducting a SWOT Analysis.  The 
review revealed that environmental risks from industrial waste management are complex and need to be managed in 
a holistic approach. This requires the implementation and enforcement of policies encompassing industrial ecology, 
economic instruments, regulations, and strategies that create value through the closed-loop systems, internalising the 
environmental costs and providing incentives for efficient resource use towards a circular economy and achieving 
sustainable production and consumption patterns. Most of the policies did not explicitly provide for the 
implementation of CE strategies from a regulatory point of view as industry felt the policies use the stick rather than 
the carrot approach. Nevertheless, there is voluntary implementation of the strategies as industry strive to achieve a 
CE.

Introduction 
Zimbabwe’s economy is endowed with a wealth in natural resources across many sectors that are contributing to the 
current linear model of extract, make and dispose.  Major Industries are in mining, manufacturing, and agriculture 
(UN-CTCN  2020). This implies that the country’s economic activities are based on the extraction and limited 
processing of these resources, generating little economic benefit, and impacting significantly on the environment. 
Considering this there is need to engage in industrial activities that promote value addition in resources, and industrial 
development based on technology and innovation (Xie, et al.  2020). With global environmental pollution and climate 
change emerging progressively as major global problems  as a result of increased resource consumption and, rapid 
urbanisation and industrialisation, transformation to a CE is vital and more pertinent than ever in industrial 
development in the new era as it seeks to optimise production by circulating materials within the production system 
and closing the resource loop (Feiferyte-Skirien, and Stasiškiene  2021). Figure 1 depicts the transition from a linear 
model to a circular business model in in different part of the value chain.

 Table 2.  shows a detail of the questions addressed under each factor 
Strength 
What are the major advantages of the current waste management policies in Zimbabwe? What 
are the factors that could lead to a CE through  IS? 
Weaknesses 
What are the gaps in the waste management policies? What could be improved? What is not being 
done properly? What can be avoided? What are the obstacles preventing progress? 
Opportunitie
s 
What benefits may occur in effective waste management? Are there any possible changes to 
government policy related to waste management? Are there any perceived changes in the socio-
economic patterns of the stakeholders? 
Threats 
What barriers are anticipated in the adoption of a possible CE strategy like IS? Are there any 
support or programmes CE implementation strategies are all relevant stakeholders willing and 
interested in supporting the programme? 
 A SWOT Analysis was carried out to identify how waste management policies fare in promoting circularity through 
the IS strategy.  The analysis was guided by questions to experts from the Environmental management agency a 
regulatory Authority administering the Environmental Management Act.  The respondents highlighted the Strength, 
Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats in waste management. Table 3 highlights the results of the SWOT Analysis. 
The Municipal Police has no enforcement powers yet the statutory for City of Harare for example, the officers should 
enforce. In the policies, the National laws give EMA powers to ensure collection of waste by local authorities but 
there is no penalty. Harmonization is needed as well as aligning to the constitution 
 Table 3.  The results of the SWOT Analysis 
WEAKNESSES 
STRENGTHS 
No incentives for sustainable resource utilisation 
Inadequate 
waste 
management 
and 
recycling 
infrastructure 
Recyclers may prioritise economic gains ignoring the 
environmental and social aspects 
No harmonisation of waste management policies with 
CE strategies 
Incentives for green manufacturing 
Recyclers already exist and willing to expand 
Ongoing efforts by relevant stakeholders to establish 
and enhance an EPR 
Industrial e-waste management plan already exists 
Redesigning of products to ease material dismantling 
and recycling processes 
THREATS 
OPPORTUNITIES 
Insufficient resources or political will to   enforce 
legislation 
Inadequate investments policies on research and 
development for  technology innovation that support 
CE 
Threat to continuity as a result of lack of involvement 
by end-of-life consumers 
Transition from linear to CE is already a global concern 
Business and job creation opportunities 
Waste from one industry may be used as a resource by 
another (IS) 
Waste disposal  expensive than recycling and reuse costs 
Conclusion 
The concept of CE is about sustainable resource management and unlocking the opportunity of a CE requires 
interfacing with the implementation of policies that provide for the implementation of strategies like IS. Transitioning 
to a circular economy will require a systems approach combined with a depth of sector.  The circular economy requires 
a change in mindset as all stakeholders do not participate in policy formulation therefore leading to the ineffectiveness 
of waste management regulations in implementing CE strategies. Furthermore, application of awareness Programmes 
on CE should not highlight more on the penalties but the incentives that come with employing CE strategies like IS. 
Moreover, the gaps in the existing waste management regulations can be closed by developing inventories of synergies 
so that industry may adopt IS.

Abstract 
Natural or human-caused wildfires happen in different parts of the world. Its harmful effects have increased over the 
past few years in all aspects. This paper aims to study one of the main important factors affecting both the initiation 
and propagation of wildfires. A root cause analysis was done to study the most dominant weather conditions across 
the five largest wildfires that took place in California in the last few years. Another analysis was performed using the 
IFTDSS software to investigate and determine which of the fire weather conditions had the greatest impact on the 
wildfire's various parameters. A preparedness management system for wildfires has been created, focusing on the 
main areas that need to be taken care of.

fire and arrest its advance. It is mainly done by human power. We can use robots with high capabilities to be on the 
site to do the mission more efficiently and optimize the time required to do the job. 
 
The last area of the preparedness management plan is managing the areas, properties, and businesses that are near the 
land of fires and, before all of that, saving people’s lives in these areas. The wildland urban interface area has to be 
fully prepared for the fires. That includes putting in some safety measures, for example, building houses with fire-
resistant material. The houses should also be supplied with fire detection sensors that should be connected to the 
firefighting agent system that would be able to identify the fire and the source of it if it was caused by human activities. 
In addition, the owners of the properties should take the responsibility of removing and cleaning the area around the 
house of flammable vegetation such as trees, shrubs, grass, and dead leaves. Furthermore, the installation of a metal 
mesh screen over the house to prevent and stop embers from going into the house 
 
. The government has to put people's lives at the top of their priorities, and this is done by providing the needed health 
and safety tools to be provided and distributed. A fully organized evacuation plan that keeps updating to accommodate 
all the residents without missing an area and in a short period of time. The governments also have to control the 
urbanization in the area since the number of people living nearby has increased tremendously over the years and, since 
most of the wildfires are caused by humans, controlling their numbers and activities can minimize the occurrence of 
wildfires. Figure 14 represents the system used for the preparedness management plan. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The increase in the intensity of wildfires has become a concern to the public due to their drastic environmental, 
economic, and health impacts. Preventing wildfires might not be the best option for such natural phenomena. However, 
preparedness and predicting the behavior of wildfires by studying the major contributors in terms of weather provide 
the tools necessary to avoid wildfires from propagating beyond control. Analyzing the root causes of major wildfires’ 
and studying weather patterns is essential and more efforts need to be placed in this area of study to provide a platform 
of actionable plans that can be implemented to communicate with the people in charge, as well as inform the public 
of the latest efforts in combating wildfires. Efforts such as simulation software are highly effective in predicting the 
behavior of wildfires in terms of ignition probability, spread and intensity. Moreover, wind speed can be a driving 
factor in the growth of a wildfire. Predicting mega wildfires can be further enhanced by studying wind patterns over 
the years to ensure the best preparedness and staffing plans are in place, which will crucially minimize the catastrophic 
impacts of such destructive fires. Wildfire preparedness is considered to be one of the most critical issues in dealing 
with fires. Having a well-prepared plan that tackles the main areas can contribute massively to the way we fight fires 
in the most efficient way.

to achieve no or few inventory in cross-dock depot. This service method shows the potential of handling a large 
number of manufacturers and volatile service requirements in platform-driven crowdsourced manufacturing. 
 
The second contribution is that this study formulates the optimal decision-making model of logistics services for 
platform-driven crowdsourced manufacturing through cross-docking as C-VRPCD. The B&P algorithm is proposed, 
which utilizes a divide-and-conquer philosophy to decompose C-VRPCD into master problems and subproblems. The 
two problems are connected by dual values of the RMP, and subproblems are to update the column pool for size 
controlled RMP. Pulse Algorithm is applied as the fundamentals to solve subproblems. Branching rules on the freight 
exchange variables are used to search integral solutions in a quadtree. The proposed branch-and-price algorithm is 
tested through a problem built from two 25-customer instances in the Solomon’s benchmark. 
 
Future work of this study includes comparing the efficiency of different ESPPRC algorithms for solving the 
subproblems, applying cutting techniques in the branch-and-price framework to accelerate the branching process, and 
studying different branching strategies to reduce the number of branching nodes.

Abstract 
Traditional industries like mining are in the spotlight for the need of improving processes to-wards net zero 
emissions. This article presents a case on a new business model to ease the adoption of Machine Learning (ML) 
to optimize industrial processes, applied to a copper mine. The focus of the paper is to present an agile 
methodology to ease the adoption of ML in industrial environments. The authors intend to illustrate the way a ML 
platform with a Low code solution approach can give results in two months to optimize a traditional production 
process. The methodology used in the case allows to obtain a data model to be validated in less than two months. 
This work pretends to give more light to the use of industrial data and the way traditional industries can evolve 
towards the Industry 5.0 paradigm which emphasizes the need to achieve sustainability in the production 
environment. The featured process is copper milling and the adoption of the low code solution is based on lean 
startup methodology. The cycle to obtain validated results includes the involvement of people from the process 
as well as analytics experts. At the end, the contributions of the solution to improve Operational Equipment 
Effectiveness (OEE) can be seen, and the process operators became empowered with the predictions that give the 
platform.

Abstract 
Environmental literacy about how to manage that can be accessed through digital media is the object of research need 
for information is the main reason for respondents to access content in the educational videos on waste management 
through social media. Research goals is to find out whether the educational movement through social media can 
influence housewives to manage their kitchen waste better. This is quantitative research to examine more deeply the 
behavior of housewives in managing their kitchen waste, as well as what their needs are related to social media content 
that contains information about kitchen waste management. Furthermore, the results of this study can be used to 
develop a social media content model to educate housewives in utilizing kitchen waste as an environmental 
sustainability movement.

1. Introduction
Human waste that continues to accumulate from time to time is one of the causes of environmental damage. Dr. Costas 
Velis of the University of Leeds said that 1.3 billion tons of plastic waste was expected to pollute the world's lands 
and oceans by 2040 if people do not take global action to prevent it (Gill). In a press release, the Minister of 
Environment and Forestry, Siti Nurbaya said that the national waste stockpile in a year reached 67.8 tons, and it will 
continue to increase in line with population growth (Nugraha).  
Household waste is no exception, which is often become a problem because it is not managed properly from upstream 
to downstream. Referring to the Indonesian Environmental Statistics data released by BPS (Central Bureau of 
Statistics), only 1.2 percent of households recycle their waste, while another 66.8 percent handle their waste by burning 
it, even though this method can interfere with health and pollute the environment. The remaining 32 percent of 
households choose other ways to handle their waste, such as being buried or disposed of in the TPA (Final Disposal 
Site)  
The results of a survey on Waste Management in the Household Environment in five cities, namely Jakarta, Bandung, 
Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surabaya in 2019 from KIC (Katadata Insight Center) showed that as many as 50.8 percent 
of households did not sort their waste because they did not want to feel bothered. Meanwhile, 49.2 percent of 
households sorted their waste, 59.2 percent categorized their waste into wet-dry and 18.4 percent categorized their 
waste into organic-inorganic (Wulandari). This data explains that there are still many people who do not have 
awareness of managing their household waste.

Based on the tahle test above, multiple linear regression equations can be arranged as follows; 
Y = c + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + β4X4 + e  
Y = 1,132 + 0,902X1 + 0,974X2 +0,765X3 +1,175X4 
 
Based on these results, it can be conluded there is correlation between environmental education and waste management 
behavior. There are four action that mentioned in this research; reduce, reuse, recycle disposal. Based on descriptive 
analysis showed that majority of respondents agreed (50%) and strongly agreed that (45.8%) regarding the effect of 
environmental education on waste management behavior. Among the four ways in managing ways, respondents agree 
that reuse and recycle are effective ways of waste management to maintain environmental sustainability.  
 
These results indicates the level of knowledge about waste management is quite high (95%), from these results 
respondents state that they know how to manage kitchen waste through educational content. Based on each 
components in environmental education, awareness and knowledge about ways of waste management, showed that 
there is stimuli from within a person that drives an activity. In consumer behavior context, waste management activity 
is the result of a stimulus-response process that appears when a person is exposed to information. Response shown 
that information as content was consumed give some behavior impact in waste management. Environmental literacy 
as information that shared in some various platform being information source that determines the behavior in waste 
management. Based on research finding state that respondent have basic knowledge about waste management, such 
as reduce, reuse, recycle and disposal. Among the four ways of waste management, respondent stated that they know 
and understand how to process kitchen waste said that there some education content show how to process kitchen 
waste. Some myriad digital platforms, such as TikTok and Instagram are content sharing platform are the most widely 
by respondent, so they become sources of educational information to share about waste management.  
 
Based on research result, showed that respondent mostly (60%) carry out waste recycling activities as waste 
management behavior. Based on these data, it concluded that they looking for educational information that help them 
to have acknowledge in waste management. The need of educational information to provide knowledge about waste 
management, makes the importance of educational literacy in the form of content found on several digital platform. 
Shapiro and Hugdes (1996) speak about information literacy in a board context by stating that information is a 
component of knowledge, the human mind and human communication. To adding knowledge about waste 
management, information literacy obtained by respondent such as video content posted in digital platform (Instagram, 
tiktok, facebook, etc). Video content has component of knowledge that acceptable as human communication process. 
Education video can be categorized as environmental literacy that have consumed content on social media platform.  
Instagram, Youtube and Tiktok are most social media platform where can find video about waste management 
through utilize household waste. 
 
Social media became platform that accessed by respondent regularly because social media allowing for all the users 
see educational content about waste management. This is one of the things that shape consumer behavior in waste 
management. Consumer behavior refers to the behavior displayed by consumers in searching for information, so 
consumers’s preference about sustainable waste management. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Sustainable environment could be define as concept about ability to maintain valued quality in physical environment. 
There are some action to show consumer preference and behavior in waste management; reduce, reuse, and recycle. 
To develop knowledge about waste management, there is source information as literacy that already followed by

consumer such as Instagram and tiktok as content sharing platform. Based on content characteristic, video tutorial 
categorized as media literature to educate environmental literacy.  
Consumer behavior showed that recycle is the most ideal and effective way to manage household waste. They stated 
that knowledge about how to manage household waste in recycle way through social media platforms. Instagram and 
Tiktok became content sharing platform often sharing viral video about waste management. Research finding showed 
that social media content as literacy educate in utilizing kitchen waste as an environmental sustainability movement. 
Further research about implementation about content model that works to educate consumer about waste management. 
Additionally, the result of this research can also be used to add reference about sustainability environment and digital 
literacy should an interested study to implement the strategy.

Abstract 
Biogas is competitive, viable and generally sustainable energy resource due to abundant supply of cheap feedstock 
and availability of a wide range of biogas applications in heating, power generation, fuel, and raw material for further 
processing and production of sustainable chemicals including hydrogen and carbon dioxide and biofuels. The capacity 
of biogas power has been growing rapidly for the past decade with global biogas generation capacity increasing from 
65 GW in 2010 to 120 GW in 2019 representing a 90% growth. The study showed that digester design, operation and 
maintenance is a very important aspect of biogas energy and technology development.  It was established that there 
are three basic digester designs i.e. fixed dome, floating dome and fixed dome with expansion chamber. The main 
challenges facing digesters is silting, poor serviceability and limited mixing ability. Design improvements suggested 
are manual and motorised mixing and provision of access manhole to facilitate maintenance and service without 
stopping the entire process.  
Key words: Biogas applications; Biogas production; digester design; digester operations. 
 
Introduction 
A vast number of countries particularly in the developing world are facing an energy crisis(Kabeyi  2022; M. J. B. 
Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju  2022).  The national energy drivers of all countries globally are energy security, 
environmental protection, and economic growth (M. Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju  2022). Additionally, international 
treaties like Agenda 21,  Kyoto Protocol  and the Paris agreement of 2015 advocated for a transition to renewable and 
low carbon sources of energy due to high greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel and the related climate 
change caused(Abanades et al., 2021; Sahota et al.  2018). Biogas has  significant potential as a renewable energy 
source for industrial as well as domestic applications and is therefore an  efficient solution to the global energy crisis 
(Achinas et al.  2017; Kumar et al.  2018). The increasing use of fossil fuels and environmental concerns over 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change has generated interest in biogas as an alternative renewable energy 
resource as a substitute(M. Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju  2022; Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi & Oludolapo Akanni 
Olanrewaju  2022a; Pasternak  2021). Increasing environmental and policy concerns and measures have generated 
increasing interest in the use of biomass resources as renewable feedstock for electricity generation, fuels production, 
chemicals processing and hydrogen production. This has been further compounded by  depletion of fossil reserves, 
growing organic waste production and global warming threats which combined have increase interest in anaerobic 
digestion and biogas fuel resources(Tagne et al. 2021). The main application for biogas is electricity generation, 
thermal applications like cooking, heating, and lighting, and production of biofuels. Over 7000 MW of electric power 
is generated  from biogas annually(Herz et al. 2017). 
 
Bio-digestion in digesters can be used to address energy, environmental, and health issues among rural communities. 
Bio-waste i.e. plant waste, animal and human excrement, are placed in the digester to   decompose under controlled 
conditions for optimum production of biogas for use as fuel and to heat homes while the remaining waste can be used 
as organic for local farms and gardens. Biogas can be used to reduce the amount of plant waste used as fuel thereby",,,european 2022

Abstract 
Diesel power plants are widely used in stationary and mobile power applications ranging from emergency 
power plants, standby plants, peak power plants and black start plants. The main elements are an internal 
combustion engine and an electric generator for power generation. The main challenges facing diesel power 
generation are high greenhouse gas emissions, high cost of power and high fuel cost. Improvements on 
performance applied include use of supercharging, turbocharging, dual fuel conversion, and use of low carbon 
and renewable fuel sources in place of fossil fuels like biogas, biomethane, biofuels and natural gas.   
Key Words: Diesel engines; Power generation; internal combustion engines; sustainable electricity 
1.Introduction 
Diesel electric power plants generally range from few 1 MW to 50 MW capacity or multiples of such based 
on installed capacity for power supply in central power stations, off grid stations, and are also universally 
applied to supplement hydro and thermal power plants  as standby generators used for starting and emergency 
supply(Nag, 2008). Diesel power plants are generally installed in areas with no coal or natural gas supply 
with smaller and often discontinuous electricity demand like remote areas or off grid market or urban 
centers(Rajput  2021).  
 
Many developing countries rely heavily on diesel power which accounts for both grid and off grid. This 
introduced the main challenges of high greenhouse gas emissions and extremely high electricity cost as 
customers pay for both energy and the fuel used in electricity generation besides other related direct and 
indirect costs(Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi & Oludolapo Akanni Olanrewaju, 2022b).  The technical 
challenges of diesel power generation include frequent breakdowns hence less reliability and power plant 
availability which attracts penalties in most power purchase agreements(Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi & 
Oludolapo Akanni Olanrewaju 2022d).   
 
Continued reliance on fossil fuels and in particular diesel and heavy fuel oil for power generation is a leading 
source of high unit cost of power and growing greenhouse gas emissions(Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2021b; 
Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2021b). This high unit cost of power from diesel power plants is attributed to high 
cost of maintenance, high fuel costs, and engine related running costs like cot of lubrication which are high 
for typical of diesel engine power plant(Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2021a).  Unlike renewable sources of power 
like solar, hydro power and geothermal, the consumers of power pay for both electricity used and the cost of 
fuel used in power plants. Additionally, frequent breakdowns experienced in many diesel power plants reduce 
the reliability of diesel power plants in supply of grid connected power(Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi & 
Oludolapo Akanni Olanrewaju, 2022a  2022b) .  
 
Diesel power plants are easy to design and install and they require lower capital costs. They can respond to 
load changes with ease and are easy to start and stop which makes them suitable for use as peak load power","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management Rome, Italy, July 26-28, 2022

Use 
of 
renewable fuel  
The diesel or heavy fuel oil is replaced 
with an alternative fuel like biomethane or 
biodiesel  
To 
increase 
energy 
security 
by 
eliminating or reducing demand for 
fossil fuel and reduce greenhouse gas 
emission  
      From table 4, it is noted that measures like use of dual fuel design where diesel is used simultaneously 
with a cheaper or cleaner fuel like natural gas or biomethane, cogeneration where extra power is produced 
from steam generated in waste heat recovery boiler, turbocharging where the charge air compressor is driven 
by engine exhausts and use of biofuels and other renewable fuels to reduce emissions and hence sustainability 
of power generation by diesel engine power plants.   
8. Conclusion 
Diesel power plants have wide applications in power generation as emergency power plants, nursery plants, 
peak power plants, standby plants, black starts and other applications.   The plants have a thermal efficiency 
of between 30 to 40%, generate high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the electricity from diesel power 
plants has energy and fuel costs making it more expensive than many other power pants.  The efficiency of 
the diesel power plants can be increased by developing cogeneration plants to use exhaust heat to generate 
steam for operation of a steam turbine to generate extra power. The fuel cost and emissions can be reduced 
by use of biofuels and natural gas which is a cleaner fuel or biomethane which is a renewable fuel. The engine 
power output can be increased by use turbochargers and superchargers to compress the charge air which 
effectively increase engine power output while emissions from diesel power plants can be reduced by use of 
cleaner fuels like biogas, biomethane, natural gas and biofuels.

Abstract 
Electric vehicles (EVs) have undergone tremendous advancement as a result of battery technology advancement 
and reduction in the cost of batteries. Few years ago, electric vehicles were much expensive compared to the 
conventional vehicles.  The current development is redesign of the infrastructure and further advances in battery 
technology in terms of charging and charge storage and cost reduction. The transport sector is a leading contributor 
to greenhouse gas emissions and measures have to be put in place to reduce these emissions.  Measures being 
undertaken in the energy sector include development of alternative electric and/or hydrogen powertrains and 
replacement of the hydrocarbon fuels and internal combustion engine (ICE) designs. To realise large scale 
penetration of electric vehicles (EV), there is need for adequate charging infrastructure.  Road transport is a large 
emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and therefore electric mobility provides huge potential to reduce 
global greenhouse gas emissions. The various V2X technologies are V2G, G2V, V2H, V2V.  These technologies 
enable the electric cars to play a grid role not just as power consumers, but as decentralised power sources as well.  
The vehicle to grid (V2G) and grid to vehicle (G2V) technology be used to have EVs may clustered via aggregator 
to offer grid power services like load leveling, voltage regulation, and peak shaving, at a lower cost and with less 
environmental impact. Therefore, smart grid technology deployment will enhance the operation and control of 
electric vehicles   making them important energy transition facility 
Key Words: Energy transition, electric cars; electrification of transport; energy transition 
1.Introduction 
Road and rail transport is the a principle  mode of transport for people and cargo  most of which are driven by 
fossil fuel powered internal combustion engineers(Oladunni et al. 2022). The use of electric vehicles can reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependency on fossil fuel sources, promote deployment of renewable energy 
sources, the dependency on fossil fuel and mitigate the release of ozone depleting substances. Other than  provision 
of motive force for transport applications, the  development of new concept of Vehicle-to-Grid creates an import 
opportunity for vehicle owners to supply power to the grid and generate some revenue and a key pathway for the 
energy transition (Goel et al. 2021). Passenger transportation accounts for 50 to 60% of energy consumed by the 
transport sector with private cars being the dominant mode of passenger transport (Rodrigue 2022). The freight 
transport accounts for 40 to 50% of transport sector energy consumption. For most economies globally, the road 
transport accounts for 80% of domestic energy consumption. Rail and maritime shipping, are more energy-
efficient modes with greater marginal energy consumption levels. Domestic waterways provide energy-efficient 
means of transport  for both cargoes and passengers (Rodrigue  2022). The transport sector activities account for 
between 25 and 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally (Rodrigue  2022).  
After some period of low sales, 2020 saw a boom in sales for electric vehicles.   Germany realised a 263%, growth, 
France, 202% and the UK 140% rise in sales of plug-in electric passenger cars. The US and China which have 
largest EV market realised smaller growth of 4% for U.S. and 15% for China. China is the world leader in sale of 
plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), but Europe dominate plug-in car sales in 2020 with Norway, Iceland, and Sweden 
leading at   74.8%, 28 45%, and 32.3% shares, respectively(Agarwala & Das  2021; Li & Loo  2014). The global 
stock of  electric cars hit  the 10 million mark, or 43% increase over the previous year in the year 2020. Electric 
vehicles accounted for two thirds of new electric car registrations in 2020 with China having the largest fleet of h",,,european 2022

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to review the role of energy in sustainable development by ensuring sustainability in 
electricity generation, supply, and consumption. Global electricity generation remains dominated by fossil fuels 
with renewable energy sources contributing a smaller proportion. Sustainable development needs sustainable 
energy which should be reliable, stable, good quality, affordable non-polluting and socially acceptable. Various 
measures can be put in place to limit emissions from various sectors.  New technology should be developed and 
exploited for to maximize use of abundant but intermittent renewable sources a sustainable mix with limited non-
renewable sources optimized to minimize cost and environmental impact but maintained quality, stability, and 
flexibility of an electricity supply system. Other measures that can limit emissions include electrification of 
transport and industrial activities with electricity coming from renewable and low carbon sources. This review 
recommends the use of the three main strategies to minimize carbon emissions in the energy transition. These are 
conventional mitigation, negative emissions technologies which    capture and sequester carbon emissions and 
finally technologies which alter the global atmospheric radiative energy budget to stabilize and reduce global 
average temperature.  
Key Words: Energy security; energy transition; energy and electricity sustainability; greenhouse gas 
emissions; sustainable electricity; renewable energy. 
1.Introduction 
Energy is a critical requirement  for sustainable development and therefore optimum selection of low carbon and 
green energy sources remains a serious  challenge for all  developing and developed countries(Bhowmik et al. 
2020). To realize green power generation, environmental, technical social, institutional, and economic dimensions 
should be used as a selection and development criterion for sustainable energy and grid electricity planning.  
Electricity and other energy resources are very important inputs from the economical aspect and human well-
being to develop a good framework of sustainability for cleaner and stable global environment and economies. 
While choosing or selecting  energy sources for development or exploitation, technology and cost  play a crucial 
role in modern economies and societies (Bhowmik et al. 2020; Kabeyi & O. A. Olanrewaju 2020). With 
continuous  increase in global population and socio-economic activities leading to  increased urbanization, and 
industrialization around the world, demand for natural resources and energy is gradually increasing(Ebrahimi & 
Rahman  2019). It is notable that the world’s population has grown 2.5 times since 1950, while energy demand 
for energy has grown 7 times(Şengül et al. 2015). These increasing energy demand is mostly met by  fossil fuel 
combustion and nuclear power(Tunc et al. 2012).Apart from rapid growth  increase in the global energy demand, 
other challenges are depletion  of fossil fuel reserves, their price  volatility , and global climate change have 
attracted much attention to renewable energy sources. As a result, many countries have adopted policies to support 
the growth of renewable energy sources and other sustainable energy  measures in the energy transition (Ebrahimi 
& Rahman 2019). 
 
Climate change is real and is here with us hence the need to pay serious attention to mitigation measures. In the 
year 2018, the world encountered 315 incidents of climate change  related disasters that affected 68,500,000 
million people , causing an economic loss of US$ 131.7 billion (Fawzy et al. 2020). The climate related disasters 
are mainly in form of drought, floods, wildfires, and storms. These disasters are a threat to humanity as they affect",,,european 2022

Abstract 
 
Substations, which are part of electric power systems are ubiquitous, versatile and serve virtually all sectors and 
industries. These are essential high voltage units utilized to power and reliably operate facilities in the Oil and Gas 
industry. However, this available electricity also poses several electrical hazards to personnel and assets such as arc 
flashes, electric shocks, fires and explosions. Managing electrical fire risks is of growing significance since as per 
NFPA it is the leading cause of fire accidents costing personnel to suffer from severe injuries to fatalities and asset 
damages in a multi-million-dollar business. This study examines the numerous substation electrical fire risks. In 
addition, it explores the current management practices within ADNOC by conducting a gap assessment to identify the 
major gaps for managing these risks and in turn, benchmark to adopt the best practices being implemented 
internationally (such as NFPA and IEEE). Therefore, assisting in developing a framework that will outdo and optimize 
the current management practices. The designed framework primarily proposes establishing an Electrical Safety 
Committee and conducting a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis to manage these emerging electrical fires risks within 
the organization.

1. Introduction  
Nowadays, most if not all industrial and manufacturing facilities operate utilizing an electrical substation using 
electricity thanks to its discovery by Benjamin Franklin in 1752. Substation is a high-voltage electric power system 
facility which are essential elements in any industry. They are the location points in the power network where 
transformers and busbars are connected via switch gears and circuit breakers for the purpose of power transmission 
and distribution. The IEEE National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) defines a substation as “an enclosed assemblage 
of equipment, e.g., switches, circuit breakers, buses, and transformers, under the control of qualified persons, through 
which electric energy is passed for the purpose of switching or modifying its characteristics” (NESC  2021). A similar 
definition is provided by IEEE Energy Development and Power Generation Committee (EDPG) as “an area or group 
of equipment containing switches, circuit breakers, buses, and transformers for switching power circuits and to 
transform power from one voltage to another or from one system to another (NESC  2021).  There are various types 
of substations based on its main function: step-up transmission substation, step-down transmission substation, 
distribution substation, and underground distribution substation. Each design type has numerous functions such as 
stepping up or down the voltage from on level to another, regulating voltage, switching within the grid system the 
transmission and distribution circuits, measuring electric power flowing in the circuits, connecting signal 
communication to the circuits, eliminating electrical surges and lightning from the system and as interface connection 
between the electric generation plant and the system (Bottrill 2005). Figure 1 below presents the main building blocks 
of a standard electric power system which are real-time electrical energy delivery systems where the power is 
generated, transported, and distributed to the users. Unlike gas and water system, electric power systems are not 
storage systems (McDonald  2016). The system starts with a power plant where the electrical energy is produced

Abstract 
Typical actions performed by order pickers in e-commerce warehouses include retrieving, scanning, grabbing, lifting, etc. making 
the human order-picker the spine of such warehouse operation.  For an order picking system based on a Goods-to-person (GtP) 
strategy, the repetitive motions raise many concerns. This increased frequency of actions may lead to the development of 
musculoskeletal diseases in the order picker’s body. Many methodologies, like human factors simulation, are available and can 
be utilized to assess the impact of the working environment on the human body. However, the evaluation of human factors in a 
simulated environment might differ from the actual case in real life since the interpretations of fatigue and discomfort can be 
subjective. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to validate the results obtained from the human factors simulation, by 
constructing a physical order picking environment and comparing the output through evaluating responses from volunteers who 
are subjected to similar to the simulated order picking environments and tasks. Three matrices of human factors were evaluated in 
this study. The study concludes that the results obtained from human factors simulation are in line with the subjective 
interpretation of the discomfort and fatigue experienced by the volunteers. As well as RULA ratings are similar in both cases.

6. Conclusion  
After collecting the data and analyzing it, the team developed conclusions that summarize the findings of this project. 
The simulation software results were pretty accurate. As a result, using simulation to study the human factors of 
workers in warehouses is advisable. It will optimize the cost of studying the worker’s human factors as well as finding 
the best mitigations to avoid fatigue and injury risk. On the other hand, the simulation software has some limitations 
as it is very time-consuming, not user-friendly, and requires a high amount of accuracy to get good results. 
Furthermore, some postures are not supported in the simulation software. For instance, the volunteers used a squatting 
position to reach the lower shelf items, but the team couldn’t simulate it as the software does not support the squatting 
position. Additionally, training is essential for volunteers to make them understand the task accurately. The number 
of volunteers was based on their availability when the experiment was conducted, and it was not mathematically 
calculated since the team did not have enough expertise and knowledge to calculate it.

Abstract 
Infrastructures can be monitored by using complex IT architectures involving also the usage of UAVs. UAVs may 
operate by forming ad-hoc networks and may be integrated with advances sensors, like LIDAR (Light Detection and 
Ranging) to build a digital model of the infrastructure. Starting from a previous experience of application of this 
approach to monitoring road infrastructures, in this paper, we analyze the security issues of such approaches, by 
identifying three categories of attacks, namely (1) attacks on routing, (2) attacks on measurements, and (3) UAV 
impersonation. For all these attacks, we identify a possible trust-based approach to mitigate the risk. This kind of 
approach allows us to improve the resilience of the system and can be combined with standard cybersecurity protection 
mechanisms.

1. Introduction
The adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for infrastructure monitoring is an emerging approach allowing 
us to improve the quality, the effectiveness, the continuity, and the affordability of monitoring activities. UAVs can 
be integrated with advances (passive or active) sensors capable of retrieving accurate measures describing the status 
of the infrastructure, and can be part of a complex IT system that leverage the UAVs to build a Wireless Sensor 
Network (WSN) referring to a Base Station (BS) which measures are continuously sent. 
Among other infrastructures, this paper focuses on road infrastructures, by leveraging a preliminary study conducted 
in Scoleri (2016), in which UAVs are used to implement the monitoring task. 
Analysis of degradation evolution of road pavements must ensure road safety. Degradation evolution causes increased 
rehabilitation costs. A high-velocity survey of the road network is necessary to estimate hazardous conditions and 
maintenance scheduling, and to detect the progress of portions of the infrastructure that are often difficult to reach. A 
systematic approach to pavement management is necessary to provide effective characteristics of pavement 
deterioration and its evolution over time. The goal of preventive maintenance is not limited to the elimination of 
critical issues, but is geared toward the identification of solutions that ensure adequate effectiveness over time and 
durability of solutions. Pavement consists of a succession of layers with different mechanical and physical 
characteristics. Several types of road superstructures can be listed: flexible (friction layer, binder layer, base layer, 
unbound base layer, subgrade), semi-rigid (as above, but with a cement-treated base layer), and rigid (concrete slab 
resting on one or more layers). The phenomenon of fatigue is one of the main causes of pavement structure 
deterioration. Read (1996) proposed the following definition, ""Fatigue in asphalt pavements is the phenomenon of 
cracking. It consists of two main stages, initiation and propagation, and is caused by tensile deformation generated not 
only by traffic-induced loading, but also by temperature variations and construction procedures."" A road pavement

6. Identity Trust 
The last problem we consider in this paper is impersonation. Obviously, classical authentication techniques can be 
used to contrast this problem, possibly based on challenge-response-based and cryptographic mechanisms.  
UAV networks, concerning identification of peers, may suffers from various attacks such as forgery attack, man-in-
the-middle attack and reply attack. All these attacks can be prevented if identity authentication is strong. Therefore, 
identity authentication is a fundamental task to perform in secure and reliable way before the drones start to 
communicate with each other. A problem is that standard cryptographic mechanisms such as RSA-certificate based 
authentication mechanisms require appreciable resource computation, which is, instead, very limited in the case of 
UAVs. Lightweight identity authentication methods, possibly based on ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) (Teng et 
al.  2019) or on intelligent approach (Jiang et al.  2020) are thus welcome. 
However, we cannot exclude that the attacker is able to compromise the computer system on board of the UAV to the 
extent that it is able to access any secret stored in it. Therefore, even very robust standard authentication mechanisms 
can be successfully used by the attacker without impersonation being able to be detected by either the other nodes in 
the network or the BS. 
 
A way to mitigate this risk is to work on the basis of a trust-based approach. This is accomplished in our trust model 
by including the component Ti (identity trust), playing as a multiplicative factor of the function used to build the digital 
model of the monitored infrastructure, as for the component Tm. The identity trust is managed and updated on the basis 
of a machine learning (ML) approach. This is done by equipping both the UAVs and the BS of a ML model, which 
learns, in the cold state of the system, the behavior of each UAV. The global model is kept by the BS, but its update 
is done incrementally by using a federated-learning approach by using updates sent by the single UAVs. We prefer to 
update the global model via local models (thus, using federated learning) to allow the model to capture a global view 
of UAVs. This global view takes into account both the hierarchical behavior (i.e., the behavior regarding the interaction 
of the UAV with the BS) and the social behavior (i.e., the behavior regarding the interactions among UAVs in the 
network). Obviously, we expect correlation between the decreasing of the routing trust and the decreasing of the social 
component of the identity trust, due to the anomalous social interaction occurring when the routing test fails. 
 
The usage of federated learning opens to possible malicious attempts of UAVs. As, in this case, no problems of privacy 
arise, the only possible attack is and adversarial attack. In this case, one UAV, possible colluding with other UAVs 
aims to deceive the global model. An attack like this is called free-rider attack (Fraboni et al. 2021), in which the 
attacker collaborates to the global ML model just by sending fake updates. Also adversarial attacks like the free-rider 
attack can be contrasted by using, in turn, trust-based approaches. 
In the Table 1, we report the main features of the approaches used for the computation of the three components of 
trust.

7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we highlight a number of possible security issues and innovative countermeasures in a UAV-based 
infrastructure monitoring system. In particular, we considered attacks on routing, attacks on measurements, and UAV 
impersonation. For each attack, we identity a strategy to contrast and mitigate the corresponding risk. The proposed 
strategies are trust and blockchain based. Due to the vastness of the topic, and by considering the aim of this paper, 
we chose to provide a horizontal view of issues and countermeasures, instead of focusing on some vertical problems. 
As a consequence, solutions are only sketched, and a deep implementation and validation of them is left to future 
work. As a conclusive consideration, we highlight two important aspects. The first is that the threat model we consider 
is very realistic, by considering the specific application domain. Indeed, infrastructures may be typically critical 
infrastructures of a country. Therefore, they can be target for attacks coming from state-sponsored, criminal or 
terroristic hacking organizations. Suppose for example that the infrastructure we are monitoring is a road infrastructure 
(like the case by which this paper takes inspiration). In this case, a cyberattack might be launched in coordination with 
a physical attack to the infrastructure (a bridge, for example), to masquerade the physical attack and then maximize

the damage to people and environment. The second consideration, is that even though the issues discussed in this 
paper are somewhat orthogonal to the specific domain of interest, we tried to contextualize them, thus making the 
proposal effective. As an example, the all-is-well attack is tailored to the application-domain scenario.

Abstract 
On-road emissions data for different types of vehicles are needed for estimating the CO2 emissions and fuel 
consumption which can affect the car-buying behavior of the citizens with the goal of helping to mitigate the 
consequences of global warming and achieving sustainable development. The Government of Canada presents a 
dataset that provides model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-
duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. Citizens can check the vehicles with the best fuel consumption ratings and 
lowest estimated annual fuel cost to save money and help to enhance the carbon emission issues. The data covers all 
the vehicle models from 1995 to 2022, including more than 1000 models from more than 50 companies. This paper 
focuses on the vehicle classes prevalent in the market (such as SUV, Compact, and Two-seater) to analyze their 
emissions factor and fuel consumption considering the average performance of the vehicle classes during previous 
years. The output shows that in different vehicle classes, the range of the carbon emissions varies significantly. The 
new vehicle models presented to the market do not necessarily have a better performance in sustainability aspects and 
car buyers should pay more attention to the scores of the vehicles considering various environmental indexes.

1. Introduction
Nowadays both transportation and energy generation sectors are key actors in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
scene, gathering about 14% and 25% of total GHG emissions worldwide, respectively (Pachauri et al. 2014). To reduce 
vehicle emitted greenhouse gases (GHGs) on a global scale, the scope of consideration should be expanded to include 
the manufacturing, fuel extraction, refinement, power generation, and end-of-life phases of a vehicle, in addition to 
the actual operational phase (Kawamoto et al. 2019). Although many cities use green mobility systems such as public 
bicycle sharing systems, greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption have still remained a serious issue for 
governments (Vishkaei et al. 2020; Vishkaei et al. 2021). Vehicle stock is a key factor in determining oil use and CO2 
emissions in the transportation sector and vehicle technologies improve over time because of either government 
requirements or market competition (Huo et al. 2007). A considerable amount of fuel is consumed by cars each year, 
resulting in a large amount of exhaust emissions. In 2011, approximately 59% of oil was used for transportation 
resulted in approximately 22% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (Zhou et al. 2016). Current energy 
consumption in the transportation sector accounts for about one quarter of the global energy demand and is expected 
to double until 2050 (Sierra 2016). 
Light Duty Vehicle(s) means a mobile machine that is primarily used to transport passengers and cargo (e.g., cars, 
vans, SUVs, pickup trucks), with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) less than or equal to 10,000 pounds. Figure 
(1) shows the yearly sales of new light-duty commercial vehicles in Europe from 2014 to 2021. In recent years the
average sales were around two million units (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1195893/light-duty-vehicles-sales-
europe/).

2. Conclusion 
In this paper, a dataset of different vehicle models that were available in the market in different years from 1995 to 
2022 is analyzed to compare various vehicle classes and engine types in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. 
The dataset is provided on a government website in Canada to be used by the citizens before deciding to buy a specific 
vehicle model considering their carbon footprint. After analyzing the dataset using different plots and graphs, the 
following points can be mentioned as the main outputs of the research. 
• 
The maximum number of vehicle models is related to 2015 and the minimum number of the models is 
perceived in 1998. 
• 
The vehicle classes that have more than 50% of the market in terms of the number of models include 
SUVs: small, Mid-size, and Compact classes. 
• 
Companies always provided more models for four, six, eight, and three-cylinder engine vehicles 
respectively. 
• 
The mean, median, minimum, and maximum amount of fuel consumption has increased for the new 
models of vehicles (the models that are provided to the market in the last few years) considering four, 
six, eight, and three-cylinder engine vehicles from 2011 to 2022. 
• 
Except for the four, six, and eight-cylinder engine vehicles the variety of the models in other types is 
reduced from 2011 to 2022. 
• 
On average the current models of vehicles with eight cylinders are more similar in terms of fuel 
consumption compared to 10 years ago. 
• 
For vehicles with more than eight cylinders, the difference in fuel consumption in the city and on the 
highway is more significant compared to the vehicles with three and four cylinders. 
• 
In 2022, all the models of three-cylinder engine vehicles have an average fuel consumption between 
zero and 8.33 L/km. This is the same for most the four-cylinder vehicles except for some models that 
have an engine size between 1.4 and 2.5 L. 
• 
The fuel consumption rate becomes more significant for most of the models with more than six 
cylinders and with the size of the engine of more than 3.5 liters.  
• 
Regarding the four, six, eight, and three-cylinder engine vehicles, on average the performance in 
carbon emissions (grams per kilometer) of all types of vehicles with the different numbers of cylinders 
has improved from 2011 to 2022. 
• 
In 2022, the average CO2 rate of the vehicle models with three-cylinder engines is lower than the other 
engine types but all the three-cylinder engine models do not have necessarily a better performance in 
this indicator compared to other vehicle models with a higher number of cylinders. 
• 
Car buyers should consider that all three-cylinder vehicles do not have always a better efficiency 
compared to four-cylinder engine models. Some vehicle models with four-cylinder engines have 
identical performance compared with some three-cylinder models with the same engine size in terms 
of CO2 rating score. 
• 
In 2022, the vehicle models with four cylinders and 1.8 or 1.6 L engine size have the maximum 
average CO2 rating which equals 7.3. 
• 
In 2022, considering vehicle classes SUV: small, Mid-size, Compact, Subcompact, Full-size, Station 
wagon: small, SUV: standard, and Two seaters, various models of every class have different 
performances in consuming fuel and emitting CO2. The models with a 1.8 L engine size in the mid-
size class and some models with a 1.6 L engine size from the ""Station wagon: small"" class have the 
best performance regarding carbon emissions and fuel consumption. The compact class with three 
cylinders on average has the least carbon emission and fuel consumption.

Abstract 
This research aims to determine the effect of client importance, audit capacity stress, and audit fee both partially and 
simultaneously on audit quality. This research’s population is financial companies listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange 
for the year 2016-2020. Purposive sampling was used as the research sampling technique. Therefore, the samples 
obtained were 50 financial companies for the period 2016-2020. Logistic regression was used in this research to 
analyze the data. Results of the hypotheses show that client importance, audit capacity stress, and audit fee affect audit 
quality simultaneously while only audit fee affects audit quality partially. This research adds to the limited number of 
samples and variables that could affect audit quality. It is suggested to do the next research with client importance as 
an independent variable on audit quality with a different measurement. The implications and recommendations will be 
discussed further in this research.

1. Introduction
The existence of differences of interest between two parties, management and shareholder, can cause the conflict of 
interest. The external auditors in this case are the middle party from the interests of two parties that are assigned to do 
evaluation and assess whether the financial report made by the management party is presented fairly and in accordance 
with existing standards (Febriyanti and Mertha  2014). The high-quality information in the financial report can be 
created by improving the audit quality (Salsabila  2018). Audit quality is the ability of the auditors in finding and 
reporting the finding of unintentional or intentional errors in the financial report of related entities and included in the 
audit opinion (Murti and Firmansyah  2017). In order to conduct the audit of financial reports, independent and 
competent auditors to make the audit are reliable by all of the interested parties (Ardani  2017). The competency of 
auditors is to preserve the professional knowledge and skills to ensure that clients receive the professional and 
competence service from the auditor (Tuanakotta, 2017:51). The independent auditors are auditors who work freely 
without any pressure as well as objectively (Gaol  2017). The term objective, according to Tuanakotta (2017:51) is 
impartiality, conflicts of interest or pressure from others to override professional and business judgments. 
The competition in giving public accounting services makes the auditors obliged to stand in the fierce competition of 
the service world to gain the public’s trust. The public’s trust obliged the auditors to maintain the quality of the given 
audit to be held accountable (Novrilia et al.  2019). However, there are still some cases found regarding audit quality 
that reduce the trust of financial reports’ users in the audit result. 
The first case regarding the audit quality of the financial sector occurred at Sunprima Nusantara Finance Incorporated. 
The Financial Services Authority (OJK) imposed sanctions in the form of cancellation of registration to 2 public 
accountants (PA) and the public accounting firm (PAF) related, that is one of Deloitte’s affiliates. The administrative 
sanctions imposed because both PA and PAF related were claimed did not give a reasonable opinion on the actual 
condition. The financial report at SNP Finance Inc. in the year 2018, which PA and PAF audited related, gained an 
opinion of Unqualified, whereas, according to the audit result of OJK, SNP Finance Inc. was indicated had presented 
a financial report that was not reflecting the real condition of the company’s finance which led to a loss for many 
parties (Wareza  2018).

The equation of the logistic regression model based on the table above is as follows.

The estimated value contained in the logistic regression equation above can be interpreted from the B value 
in table 5.6 above. The interpretation of the value of B is as follows. 
a) 
Constanta (α) of -5.109 indicates that the audit quality, the dependent variable, will fall by 5.109 if the 
independent variable is assumed to be constant. 
b) 
The client importance variable regression coefficient is -7.289. It means that if there is a decrease in 
client importance by one unit and the other variables are constant, then the audit quality variable will 
decrease by 7.289. 
c) 
The regression coefficient of the audit capacity stress variable is 3.794. It means that if there is an 
increase in audit capacity stress by one unit and the other variables are constant, the audit quality 
variable will increase by 3,794. 
d) 
The audit fee variable's regression coefficient is 0.479. In other words, if the audit charge is raised by 
one unit and the other variables remain the same, the audit quality variable will rise by 0.479.

Based on table 5.6, the value of chi-square is 25.189 with a significance value is 0.000 lower than the 
significance level α = 5% or 0,05. This means that client importance, audit capacity stress, and audit fee 
simultaneously affect audit quality.  
 
5.7 Partial Test 
The explanation of the partial test results based on table 5.6 is as follows. 
a) 
The significance value of the client importance variable is 0.433. It means that the significance value 
is greater than the significance level α = 5% or 0.05. As a result, the audit quality is partially unaffected 
by the client importance variable because H01 is approved and Ha1 is refused. 
b) 
The significance value of the audit capacity stress variable is 0.227. It means that the significance value 
is greater than the significance level α = 5% or 0.05. As a result, H02 is approved and Ha2 is refused 
which means partially, the audit quality is unaffected by the audit capacity stress variable. 
c) 
The audit fee variable has a significance value of 0.019. It indicates that the significance value is less 
than the α = 5% or 0.05 significance level. Thus, H03 is refused and Ha3 is approved so that partially, 
the audit fee variable influences audit quality. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The audit quality in financial sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the years 2016 to 2020 is 
simultaneously influenced by client importance, audit capacity stress, and audit fee. In contrast, during the years 2016 
to 2020, the only factor affecting the audit quality in financial sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
is the audit fee.

The recommendation for PAF and the management party is to pay attention to and evaluate the factors of audit fees 
and companies’ financial performances that can influence the high and low audit quality. For academics, it is expected 
to increase knowledge and information about audit quality and the factors that influence it. Further research will be 
discussed in the following paragraph, which is also related to the limitations of this research. 
 
This research has some limitations, such as the total of limited samples of 50 financial companies for the period 2016-
2020. For further research, it is expected that the researchers can add the number of research objects from other sectors. 
Another limitation is on the total number of independent variables, and it is expected in further research to add more 
variables that have probabilities in influencing audit quality. Another limitation is that it is expected for the further 
research to use different proxies for measuring each variable, like discretionary accruals or audit adjustments for audit 
quality, the ratio of a company's total sales to the total sales of all companies signed by partners in observation for 
client importance, size of audited clients for audit capacity stress, and the actual total audit costs incurred by the 
companies which are listed in the companies’ annual reports.

Abstract 
Risks are a reality every organization faces on a daily basis. This study proposes a cloud based Integrated Risk 
Management System following the steps dictated by IRM which include, Problem Identification, Risk Estimation, 
Risk Evaluation, Risk Mitigation and Control and finally Risk Monitoring. A field study was performed on a 
recreational facility located in Lebanon. An extensive review is applied, including interviews and surveys. This 
integrated system aligns the organization’s goals and values with its risk management strategies as well as international 
standards. It fosters a holistic approach and systematic thinking to determine risks and mitigate them. Adding on to 
the IRM, Fuzzy Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to 
Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are utilized as supplementary methods to properly identify and prioritize failure modes and 
to yield the requested results. The significance of this study can be summarized as providing a tool for them to instantly 
respond to both tactical and strategic risk factors encountered while increasing situational awareness within the 
company especially with the development of the proposed holistic cloud-based IRM approach. The organization stated 
that with the proposed cloud-based communication tool that utilizes the Fuzzy FMEA and TOPSIS methods, it can 
implement the recommended solutions to risk items more quickly and effectively, therefore ensuring security and 
safety to the employees of the facility and its guests.

Abstract 
The health crisis that our country is going through is very difficult to manage and vaccination is of utmost importance 
to counteract it; however, the logistical process of purchasing and distributing vaccines is very complex. Objective: 
Therefore, the present research article aims to design a predictive model that influences the logistic response planning 
for COVID 19 vaccination in the district of San Juan de Lurigancho. Methods: This can be achieved using geographic 
information systems technology and the implementation of mobile vaccination centers. Results: The results obtained 
showed the lack of vaccination sites in the district and how this measure generates a great benefit in the most vulnerable 
population of the study district. In addition, it is positive the results obtained compared to the results of other articles. 
Conclusions: It is confirmed that the logistic process of vaccination can be improved from the implementation of 
mobile vaccination centers.

1. Introduction
At present, the countries with the highest rates of infection and deaths in the world generally have a poorly equipped 
and infrastructurally poor health system. The governments of the world are taking measures to slow the advance of 
the epidemic and reduce the effect it is causing on the world economy (García Monsalve et al.  2021). Therefore, a 
series of measures have been implemented to combat this pandemic: First, oxygen plants have been acquired to avoid 
dependence on other countries. Secondly, more beds were implemented in the intensive care unit for the care of people. 
Lastly, the vaccination process has been carried out to avoid the increase of contagions and the saturation of hospitals. 
The latter is one of the most effective methods to control the spread of epidemics / pandemics (Sinha et al. 2021). The 
global hope of controlling the disease rests on the effective and universal distribution of available vaccines (Herrera-
Añazco et al.  2021). In addition, it is important that the logistical process for vaccine distribution is as efficient as the 
efficiency of the vaccines, where effective cooperation between government, health plans, hospitals, and frontline 
care, particularly during emergencies, helps facilitate the vaccination process (Rosen et al.  2021).  
The logistics required for vaccination in San Juan de Lurigancho are complex due to the rugged geography. Also, the 
COVID-19 vaccination program must address challenges related to the cold chain and vaccine distribution system, as 
well as vaccine acceptance by citizens (Nugraha et al.  2021). Consequently, access to vaccination sites is a major 
problem to solve. Moreover, achieving vaccination of the entire population is a great logistical challenge, especially 
because of the limited availability of vaccines and strict conditions of their storage and distribution (Krzysztofowicz 
and Osińska-Skotak  2021). Also, it is necessary to consider that shipping, storing, and delivering vaccines in a cost-
effective manner, remains a major challenge (Yang et al.  2021). Therefore, it is necessary to come up with a logistical 
response that can help us to improve the distribution of vaccines to the neediest population in the district; since, it is 
the most vulnerable population.  This problem leads us to ask the following research question: To what extent does an

mobile vaccination centers have a modification that allows transporting a larger quantity of vaccines, new refrigerators 
can be implemented, and the increase of trained personnel can be implemented. 
 
5.4 Validation  
This method is repeatable so that it can be successfully applied in other cities or local government units. There is no 
restriction on the level of territorial division here, it can be a district, province of any country. If there is a need for an 
analysis of another type of administrative area, for example, medical districts, it can also be implemented quickly. 
According to this simulation in GIS it is possible to parameterize the maximum number of people vaccinated per day 
or the availability of vaccines from different companies. The key factor is data on the place of residence of people in 
a specific age group. The proposed analyses could be added in more detail, taking into account information on the 
transport accessibility of a given vaccination site, understood as the distance and time needed to reach it on foot, by 
car or by public transport. This is especially important in the context of limiting social contacts and thus the risk of 
contagion. The best solution is the shortest possible route to the vaccination site or using your own transport vehicle. 
To achieve this goal, it would be necessary to use network analysis that can also be performed with the use of GIS 
technology. 
 
6. Conclusion  
We have demonstrated that the implementation of mobile vaccination centers is a more economical alternative to 
conventional centers. In addition, any logistical plan should always have several alternatives or options that help the 
process to be optimized. It was also possible to determine the ideal location of these mobile vaccination centers and 
their capacity to meet the demand. This can be seen in the scenarios that were proposed to determine whether it is 
possible to meet the district's demand and how the implementation of vaccination trucks can have a significant impact 
on economic and logistical issues.  
 
The scope of the positive impact of the vaccination campaign extends to more indirect aspects such as the motivation 
people must go to vaccination centers due to the ease with which they can travel and obtain vaccines. Different 
incentives that facilitate vaccination, such as the low cost of transportation or the speed of the process, can make a 
significant difference in protecting the population.

Abstract 
According to early 2020, the impact of the COVID epidemic and people's rapid awareness. The government has 
established projects and measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 had a significant effect on the restaurant 
business that is unable to open fully, resulting in a significant drop in sales, particularly for suki or shabu buffet 
restaurants that normally have to ""cook"" and ""eat"" in the restaurant, directly affecting customer food consumption 
behavior and causing the shabu business to stall, requiring the operator to adjust. Therefore, the government projects 
and adaptations for dealing with such situations are essential to the consumer behavior of customers. The purpose of 
this research was to investigate consumer behavior regarding shabu restaurants at Mae Fah Luang University. There 
were several influences on consumer behavior during the COVID-19 issue. The collected data was examined by using 
descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Yamane's sample size total was 388 people, which was 
used to identify a student group from Mae Fah Luang University for this study to complete the questionnaire. The 
result showed the factor analysis distinguished by the Kaiser Meyer-Olkin (KMO) method was 0.916. The 16 criteria 
are divided into four components and the four components consist of service staff, quality of ingredients (pork, beef, 
chicken, seafood, food, and vegetables), location, and measures to avoid COVID-19. The resulting awareness of social 
distancing and the use of partition COVID-19 between other customers are most important to support the elements in 
deciding whether to use hotpot service restaurants or not.

1. Introduction
Food is a part of evolution over time. Food had been thought of as something intended to fill people's stomachs and 
as a source of energy, but nowadays, it is something else that is more interesting. There are many restaurants in densely 
populated community areas that focus on the process of cooking, taste, cleanliness, and safety (Food Intelligence 
Center 2017). Shabu (Hotpot) is one of the most unique and popular restaurants because it is a food that has been 
cooked using the characteristics of boiling, making it suitable for people who appreciate health and being simple to 
prepare food; it has developed into a business that is still growing today (Siam Commercial Bank 2020). Shabu-shabu 
restaurants are increasingly more popular in Thailand. It is continuously expanding and growing to meet the growing 
demands of consumers. Many Shabu-shabu restaurants have appeared in various communities. Both are found in 
shopping malls, commercial buildings, or even general pedestrian markets that offer various services, such as a 
traditional shabu-shabu store, contemporary shabu, pay-as-you-go buffets, often known as ""All You Can Eat"" or fast

the area of Mae Fah Luang University give priority to social distancing and use partition COVID-19 between others. 
The second is restricting access to the service, such as the limit of tables and chairs, because most consumers are 
concerned about the safety and are concerned about restaurant measures to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 epidemic. 
The third place is the quality of ingredients (pork, beef, chicken, seafood, food, and vegetable). Consumers are most 
interested in choosing to eat hotpot in terms of soups taste. As a result, restaurant management, in addition to the 
quality of food (ingredients), should be focused on preventive measures against COVID-19 such as seating 
arrangements (Social distancing and use partition COVID-19between others), consumer screening before entering the 
restaurant (temperature measurement, wearing the mask) including the service of staff in giving advice. and 
maintaining the cleanliness of the store.

Abstract 
The company performance can also reflect the quality of products and or services provided by the company's 
customers. Several previous studies have found several strategies that are widely used and considered effective in 
encouraging company performance to be able to compete with companies that have been around for a long time. 
However, different from various previous studies, this study tries to relate not only one or two but the various variables 
previously mentioned, such as firm performance, marketing performance, innovation, network capability, and 
customer relationship. Therefore, this research aims to determine factors that can affect firm performance. This 
research is conducted with a quantitative approach with the subject being the service users of newcomer IT 
manufactures companies as many as 75 companies with 200 respondents. The analysis technique uses a Structural 
Equation Model (SEM) approach with smart PLS. The results in this study indicate that digital innovation, network 
capability, and marketing performance affect firm performance but customer relationship management does not. In 
addition, innovation and customer relationship management affect marketing performance but network capability does 
not. Other than that, marketing performance can moderate digital innovation and firm performance, customer 
relationship management and firm performance but cannot on network capability and firm performance. It means that 
digital innovation, network capability, and marketing performance need maintaining in order to increase the firm 
performance. Therefore, any company needs to determine the significant factors to reach the advantages. In addition, 
because this research only focuses on several factors such as digital innovation, network capability, marketing 
performance, and customer relationship, other research that involves several factors that can increase firm performance 
needs to be conducted.

1. Introduction
The company performance is an indicator that can describe the success achieved by the company in a certain period 
of time, apart from that, firm performance can also reflect the quality of the products and or services provided by the 
consumer company (Elena et al. 2018). The level of performance not only affects the company internally but also 
affects the company’s image in the eyes of consumers, where this will have an impact on company growth (Ali et al. 
2020). In addition, the company's performance will also have an impact on the value of shares in the company itself 
(Mohamed et al. 2021    ). Thus the company’s performance becomes an important thing to pay attention as an effort 
for the development and sustainability of the company. 
The performance of a company can be influenced by various factors, both internal and external. Hanelt et al. (2021) 
through his research found that digital innovation can improve firm performance, even more in the current industrial 
4.0 era. Digital innovation can be defined as the creation or change in market offerings resulting from the use of digital 
technology (Nambisan et al. 2018 ). Khin & Ho  (2018) in their research, they found that technology orientation 
and technological capability affect the company performance both financially and non-financially by being mediated

Abstract 
Companies engaged in any field need to realize the importance of having innovation to increase growth and 
productivity in all sectors. Innovative work behavior becomes an important factor for organizational performance and 
long-term survival of employees. Quantitative techniques are used in this study by involving 100 respondents in F&B 
manufacturing industries beverages focused in Indonesia. The analysis of this study is a Structural Equation Model 
(SEM) approach with the help of smart PLS. The results show that knowledge acquisition does not affect innovative 
work behavior; leader role expectations affect innovative work behavior; perceive organizational support affect 
innovative work behavior; job satisfaction affect innovative work behavior. In the mediation hypothesis, it is found 
that job satisfaction is able to mediate the relationship between knowledge acquisition and leader role expectations; 
job satisfaction is not able to mediate the relationship between perceived organizational support and innovative work 
behavior. Then, the environmental dynamism variable is not able to moderate the relationship between knowledge 
acquisition and perceived organizational support on innovative work behavior; environmental dynamism is able to 
moderate the relationship between leader role expectations and innovative work behavior.

1. Introduction
Companies engaged in any field need to realize the importance of having
innovation to increase growth and productivity in all sectors. The development
of innovation in companies requires contributions from each individual; thus,
it is important for companies to realize and improve innovation at the level of
each individual (Akram  et al. 2020). Innovative work behavior refers to
activities related to employee development, promotion, and implementation of
useful innovations at any level of the organization. Innovative work behavior
includes the development of new ideas, technologies, and techniques, as well as
testing and implementing new methods related to business procedures, in certain
work areas with the aim of providing satisfaction to customers (Saeed  et al.
2019). Innovative work behavior is an important factor for organizational
performance and long-term survival of employees. Employees with innovative work
behavior can solve problems, provide good solutions, and improve performance
(Y. Li et al. ???  ).
Rodrigues et al. (2019) found that 80% of an idea is initiated by company 
employees and another 20% is the result of an innovation plan that the company 
had set. Therefore, employees are an important part of generating innovation.

exchange behavior plays a role in promoting the three stages of individual innovation. First, members of the 
entrepreneurial team can obtain more varied information and ideas through the exchange of information, which 
provides them with additional raw materials for generating new and innovative ideas. Secondly, sharing personal ideas 
also helps them increase their understanding of other people's comments and suggestions regarding their ideas, 
allowing them to better filter and improve their innovative ideas. Finally, the behavior of information exchange can 
increase trust and cooperation among team members, which allows the realization of innovative ideas (Deng et al. 
2021). 
 
6. Conclusion  
From the research above, it can be concluded that there is no relationship between the variablesknowledge acquisition 
with innovative work behavior. There is a significant positive relationship between leader role expectations and 
innovative work behavior. There is a significant positive relationship between perceive organizational support and 
innovative work behavior. There is a significant positive relationship between the job satisfaction and innovative work 
behavior. There is a significant positive relationship between knowledge acquisition and job satisfaction. There is a 
significant positive relationship between leader role expectations and job satisfaction. There is no relationship between 
perceive organizational support and job satisfaction. In the mediation hypothesis, it is found that job satisfaction is 
able to mediate the relationship between knowledge acquisition and leader role expectations with innovative work 
behavior. Job satisfaction is not able to mediate the relationship between perceived organizational support and 
innovative work behavior. Then, the environmental dynamism variable is not able to moderate the relationship 
between knowledge acquisition and perceived organizational support on innovative work behavior. Environmental 
dynamism is able to moderate the relationship between leader role expectations and innovative work behavior.

1. Introduction
A project can be called a temporary organization that involves the cooperation of various resources with different 
skills, which is called a project team (Rahi  2019  ). An organization is a project that aims to organize so that the 
project can run well and the specified goals are achieved. So in a project, there will usually be an organizational 
structure responsible for moving and monitoring the project team to work together to achieve the goals determined at 
a certain time (Amin et al.  2016  ). An organization must have certain goals to be achieved. Prusty, T., & Kumar 
(2016) state that one of an organization's successes can be measured through performance. Performance is an actual 
reflection of the achievements that have been achieved in a certain time (Zardet, V., & Bonnet  2021  ). Therefore, 
performance is one of the most important things to consider in evaluating the effectiveness and success of an 
organization (Prusty, T., & Kumar  2016  ).  
Company performance in this study can be influenced by organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), including leader-
member exchange, quality work-life, and innovative work behavior. Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is

Abstract 
Small and medium enterprises have become one of the pillars of the national economy. In order to continue to 
maintain their existence and competitiveness in the market, SMEs need to improve their competitive advantage 
continuously. One of the efforts that can be done is to expand the business network through business-to-business 
electronic commerce (B2B e-commerce). Unfortunately, not all SMEs can do this independently. This study aims 
to determine the benefits of an e-commerce consulting platform in increasing the competitive advantage possessed 
by SMEs. The research method used in this research is qualitative. This research was conducted by tracing several 
previous studies that discussed similar matters. The results of this study indicate that an e-commerce consulting 
platform can help SMEs gain an advantage to survive in a competitive market.

Abstract 
Currently, the predominance of Agile frameworks in software development means that Lean applications in the IT 
sector are incipient or very little known. However, several authors argue that the application of Lean in software has 
more advantages than Agile could have, due to the scalability of the procedures. The objective of this research is to 
know the state of the art of the application of Lean in software development through a systematic literature review. 
After reviewing 19 articles, it was found that the most common Lean waste with the greatest impact on software 
development is waiting. The main barriers that hinder the application of Lean correspond to attitudinal components 
of people such as low understanding of Lean concepts. The most applied Lean tool is Kanban and the main advantage 
of applying Lean in software development is the improvement of team performance. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In the 1950s, software was developed through trial-and-error methods; some of these methods were incremental and 
iterative, while others were linear and sequential, such as the Waterfall model (Lei et al. 2017). This model proved to 
be inefficient and ineffective due to the changing requirements that could arise during software development, a 
characteristic given by its intangible nature. Around 2001, a group of developers proposed to change the mindset with 
which software was developed. This new way of thinking would be known as Agile and would emerge as a response 
to the Waterfall model to better deal with growing uncertainties. (Sandstø and Reme-Ness 2021). Since then, several 
agile frameworks, or methodologies according to some authors, have been created based on the Agile philosophy with 
the aim of bringing us closer to the Agile mentality. We must consider that agile frameworks such as Scrum, we 
manage the creation and delivery of products in short iterative cycles of time, to give in each iterative cycle with 
customer feedback the incrementality of value. 
For the formulation of the Agile philosophy, the group of developers relied on the principles of Lean Manufacturing, 
applicable to the production of goods and services, adapting them to the context of software development. Lean 
Manufacturing is a philosophy that seeks to eliminate waste in processes. By eliminating Lean waste, productivity 
increases, and the organizational culture is transformed in terms of quality. (Edwin-Joseph et al. 2020).  
Although the Lean philosophy is mainly applied in industrial and service sectors (Palange and Dhatrak 2021), it is 
recently gaining popularity in software development. Several authors, such as Kišš and Rossi (2018), Pernstål et al. 
(2013) or Sambinelli and Borges (2017), citing Poppendieck and Cusumano (2012), argue that the application of Lean 
in software development has more advantages than Agile might have, emphasizing mainly the scalability of 
procedures. While Agile frameworks only serve a project development level, as they were conceived for that, Lean 
tools are applicable to all types of processes within a company. However, at present, the predominance of agile

Abstract 
Megaprojects have been increasingly developed during the last decades. Megaprojects have unique particularities in 
the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry. They are significantly different from projects in other industry types since 
LNG requires a precise match of production, processing, transportation, and consumption, from strategic to 
operational decision-making. This introduces additional difficulties, risks, and challenges for proper and efficient 
project development and management. These challenges are mostly related to the highly complex, risky, and uncertain 
environment of the LNG value chain, particularities and complexities of LNG processes and projects, contractual and 
spot market trends, novel business models in the LNG industry, and the transition to renewable energy sources. They 
demand to identify opportunities for improvement, trends, challenges, and gaps for achieving breakthroughs towards 
improved and more successful management of LNG megaprojects, which is especially important given the current 
expansion of the LNG value chain in Qatar. The information and discussion provided herein are fundamental for 
adequately understanding and handling the complex, challenging environment within the LNG industry towards 
enhanced megaproject management capabilities. This work aims to provide information on the current scenario of the 
LNG expansion, discuss the importance of megaproject management within the LNG industry and the main challenges 
faced within this environment, and stimulate further studies on the topic. 
Keywords 
Megaproject, LNG, natural gas, value chain, project management. 
1. Introduction
Over the past decades, there has been a significant increase in the development and implementation of megaprojects 
in many diverse fields and areas worldwide to supply the economic growth required by the Industry 4.0 age (Soderlund 
et al. 2017). This leads to an emergent field of study focused on megaproject management systems, which aims to 
cover multiple vital aspects and elements of the topic (Wang et al. 2020). Recently, significant industrial investments 
have led to an increasing need to improve the current capabilities employed in developing, executing, and 
implementing megaprojects. This is particularly important for the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry, given the 
current expansion of the LNG value chain, mainly driven by the recent investments in the Qatar LNG industry. 
Moreover, this highlights the importance of further studies on LNG megaproject management to achieve enhanced 
industrial capabilities.  
Megaprojects play a crucial role in social and economic development in the oil and gas industry. They are critical, 
mainly because of their social and environmental concerns, sizeable economic value, and improvement provided

5. Conclusions and Future Work 
Due to the dynamic and complex environment, LNG megaprojects often face multiple challenges and risks throughout 
their lifetime and even after completion. Moreover, they are challenging to be efficiently planned, managed, 
implemented, and controlled towards providing the expected outcomes and accomplishing the desired targets and 
objectives. LNG megaproject management challenges are mostly related to accomplishing the project goals given 
multiple requirements, expectations, and desired objectives within a highly complex, risky, and uncertain 
environment. Such challenges demand identifying opportunities for improvement, trends, challenges, and gaps for 
achieving breakthroughs towards improved and more successful management of LNG megaprojects. 
This work addresses the main challenges currently faced in the LNG industry, affecting the development and 
management of LNG megaprojects, which is especially important given the current expansion of the LNG value chain 
in Qatar. That includes the supply and demand in the LNG value chain, particularities and complexities of LNG 
processes and projects, contractual and spot market trends, novel business models in the LNG industry, and the 
transition to renewable energy sources. Many of these features significantly impact the economic feasibility of LNG 
megaprojects and should be carefully considered. An inimitability in LNG megaprojects is the uniqueness of the LNG 
contracting structure. The current changes in the worldwide supply and demand of LNG lead to the transformation of 
market conditions with new trends and business models that focus on duration (short, medium, and long), price 
mechanism, cargo size, and an integrated value chain of LNG. Increased availability and reduced price of renewable 
energy sources is one of the main challenges of LNG producers as it leads to a reduction in the LNG price and impacts 
the decision to pursue new LNG projects (especially given that the project execution takes a large amount of time and 
huge investment), and leads to hesitation in such investments from the financial institutions. 
The information and discussion provided herein are fundamental for adequately understanding and handling the LNG 
megaproject's complex, challenging environment towards enhanced management capabilities. This work intends to 
highlight the importance of such topics and stimulate further studies.

Abstract 
This project investigates the relationship between restaurant ratings and prices and compares these statistics 
between two cities: Beijing and Los Angeles. The purpose of this investigation is to aid customers in 
restaurant selection and inform them what cuisine prices to expect when browsing restaurant ratings. 50 
restaurants from each city were selected through stratified and systematic sampling. In the first part of the 
study, Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient tests were conducted to test the correlation between 
restaurant ratings and prices. The tests show a significant positive relationship. Moreover, regression lines 
were constructed to display the correlation between the two variables. Customers may use these regression 
lines to estimate the average prices of a meal given the restaurant’s rating. In the second part of the 
project, two-sample t-tests were used to make comparisons between Beijing and Los Angeles. These two 
cities were selected due to their similar urbanization, modernization, and income levels. Results show 
significant discrepancies, indicating that restaurants in Los Angeles have higher ratings and prices than 
those in Beijing. This difference can be attributed to several factors, including labor cost, food culture, and 
consumption.

1. Introduction
The idiom “Bread is the staff of life” demonstrates the significance of scrumptious meals to people’s lives. 
With the development of technology and the growth of food industries in the 21st century, people are 
starting to rely on social media for their choices of dining places. As a result, reviews, ratings, and pricing 
became essential assets for restaurants. Several studies have examined how reviews influence consumer 
restaurant selection (Neflike  2017). Others have investigated the determinants of a restaurant’s 
reputation: menu prices (Dong Hong et al. 2018). However, most of these studies are restricted to a 
particular country and use rough evaluations of ratings and price levels (on scales of 1 to 5). This study will 
use detailed data to examine the correlation between restaurant ratings and prices and compare these 
statistics between cities with different backgrounds.  
2.Methods
The data for this project -- ratings and prices of restaurants -- were collected from an application named 
DianPing. Stratified, combined with systematic sampling, was used to select the 50 restaurants at each 
location.

Figure 12. Box Plot that Compares the Restaurant Prices Between Beijing and Los Angeles 
The significant difference depicted in the box plots can be explained by discrepancies in dietary habits and 
labor costs. Chinese meals are comprised of two parts: staple food -- including rice, noodles, or steamed 
buns -- and vegetable and meat dishes. The meat dishes are generally cooked from pork, which differs from 
Western meals, where meat, especially beef, and other proteins are the main dish. Los Angeles, 
specifically, has a large number of seafood restaurants, which are generally more expensive than ordinary 
restaurants. Moreover, there is a large gap in labor costs between the United States and China. Wage and 
salary costs for private industry workers averaged $38.07 per hour in the United States (U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics  2021). On the other hand, manufacturing labor costs in China were estimated to be $5.51 
per hour (M. Szmigiera  2021).  Both employer and material costs contribute to the significant difference 
in meal prices between Los Angeles and Beijing restaurants.   
In terms of shape and dispersion, Beijing’s distribution is approximately normal, with most observations 
centered around the median; on the other hand, Los Angeles’ is heavily right-skewed. Unlike Beijing, Los 
Angeles has a great number of cheap fast-food restaurants, contributing to the aggregation of points in the 
first quartile -- from $6 to $15. Additionally, the Los Angeles distribution is more dispersed, partly due 
to the large variety of Western cuisines, from spaghetti and pizza to lobsters and grilled ribs.    
4. Conclusion 
In the first part of the project, two Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient tests were conducted for the 
samples in Beijing and Los Angeles, and both were statistically significant. This result suggests that there is 
a positive, moderate to strong, relationship between restaurants’ ratings and their cuisine prices. A potential 
explanation is that higher ratings are accompanied by increases in customer demand, which in turn boosts 
prices and profit.  
 
In the second part of the project, two 2-sample t-tests were carried out to compare the statistics between the 
two cities. Both t-tests yield significant results, indicating that restaurants in Los Angeles have higher 
ratings and prices than in Beijing. There are a wide variety of reasons behind this gap, including differences 
in consumption, food culture, and labor costs.  
 
5. Future Research  
For this study, differences between restaurant rates and prices in Beijing and Los Angeles were proved 
significant. However, several factors might have influenced the accuracy of the result. Firstly, DianPing is a 
Chinese app used solely by Chinese subscribers. Data for both Beijing and Los Angeles were collected 
2309","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management

from this application to ensure uniformity of the rating benchmarks. However, it could cause other 
problems. Los Angeles locals are largely likely to have different tastes from Chinese tourists, so the 
ratings might be biased for the Los Angeles sample. Moreover, purchasing power was not taken into 
consideration. Although all measurements were converted into dollars, the same amount of money might 
have different values in different markets. To solve this problem, future research should compare cities in 
the same country. This controls purchasing power and turns the focus on the effects of the urbanization 
level. Additionally, there would no longer be biases in the user population. DianPing can still be used when 
investigating samples in China, while Yelp would be more suitable for Western countries. 
Lastly, a sample size of 50 is not large enough to represent a population of several million restaurants. 
Since manually collecting data is tedious and inefficient, future investigations may expand sample sizes by 
incorporating datasets from Yelp. Obtaining comprehensive data, more factors such as location, 
advertising, etc., can be examined.

Abstract 
Currently, governments recognize the importance of investing in early childhood education programs. Since entry into 
elementary school is a critical transition period, it is useful to measure children's development before entry. The 
objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the national preschool promotion program on the socio-connective 
variables acquired by the children who benefit from the program. The context chosen is that of Moroccan preschools 
located in rural areas. This work proposes a sequential methodology based on a conceptual analysis based on the SOR 
paradigm ""Stimulus-Organization-Response"", and an empirical methodology based on the estimation structural 
equations. The results of this work confirm the existence of a positive and significant relationship between the different 
components of the external and internal environment of the preschool program, and the skills acquired by the preschool 
children. Consequently, the results argue for the generalization of preschool education, particularly in rural areas, with 
support for public or community provision. Providing preschool education to those who are currently excluded is 
considered an efficient and equitable investment.

1. Introduction
Early childhood is a crucial phase in the construction of the individual. It is a period of rapid development that leads 
to the acquisition of a battery of skills on which future physical, neurological and psychological constructions will be 
based. Investments in early childhood are most effective when they start as early as possible. This means that they 
should start with girls and boys at an early age to ensure they benefit fully from educational opportunities and are well 
prepared for pregnancy and parenthood later in life.  
Note that millions of children around the world are missing out on the opportunities that quality early childhood 
development can bring. In the Moroccan context, public policies have focused on education and health, promoting the 
generalization of preschool promotion policies and the development of programs for access to prevention and health 
care for all children from conception.

line with the work carried out by (Chankseliani et at. 2021) which emphasize the duration of exposure to the program3. 
In view of its results, the public actors in charge of the implementation of the program must set up communication 
campaigns with parents on the importance of their children benefiting from the preschool program over a period of 
two years before entering at primary school. 
The third hypothesisHs14 analyzed and validated in the tests, concerns the relationship between the gender of the 
educators and the response dimension. The results obtained allowed us to confirm the significant and positive impact 
of the gender stereotype on student performance. In other words, the positive impact of having a male educator on the 
different skills developed by preschool children, contrary to the existing literature that highlights a positive correlation 
between the women educators and program effectiveness (Gervais-Karpowicz 1995). For this reason, the actors in 
charge of program implementation must put in place communication campaigns to encourage men to apply for these 
positions. It should be noted, that in rural Morocco, families believe that teaching by a male educator is more beneficial 
for their child. 
The validation of hypotheses HS15 and HS16 allowed us to identify a positive and significant relationship between the 
age of the educators and their level of qualification and the cumulative learning through children after their passage 
through the preschool. The purpose of this test is to identify the characteristics of the educators that have the greatest 
impact on the program. 
According to the results obtained, educators with an age between 18 and 25 have a greater impact on the skills acquired 
by the beneficiaries. With regard to the educators' level of education, the results are the opposite of the existing 
literature (White et al. 1985-1986)4 educators with a Baccalaureate level of education have the greatest impact on the 
skills acquired by the beneficiaries.  
 
5.4  Proposed Improvements  
The main orientations drawn from the results of the studies carried out are as follows 
• 
Establish preschool structure in geographic areas with a significant number of preschool-age children. 
• 
Increased time of exposure of the children to the program by maintaining the two grade levels of Middle and 
Great Section school. 
• 
Increase the proportion of men in the recruitment process and give preference to educators in the 18 to 25 
age group, with a baccalaureate diploma. 
 
6. Conclusion  
As a conclusion, and through the research within the SOR paradigm, we have accepted that there is a positive and 
significant relationship between the internal and external environment of the programme and the skills acquired by 
the preschool children. This relationship is significant for each individual construct. That is, the variables measuring 
the internal and external environment are significant. 
The results argue for the widespread provision of preschool education, particularly in rural areas, with support for 
public or community provision. Offering preschool education to those currently excluded is considered an efficient 
and equitable investment. 
In this regard, it should be noted that policies to improve equitable access to quality preschool education in rural areas, 
particularly for girls aged 4-6 years, are very limited and, if they exist, are most often offered in traditional structures. 
To remedy these shortcomings, government policies must expand the provision of quality preschool education services 
 
3According to the authors, the shorter the duration of exposure to the program (between six and eleven months), the 
less significant the impact on child development. 
4According to the results of the study: the level of training of educational staff is positively correlated with program 
effectiveness.

that promote safety, inclusion and sustainable outcomes, either through the creation and/or equipping of preschool 
facilities in areas of need, and according to standards that guarantee the quality, accessibility and sustainability of its 
infrastructure and teaching materials, and also through actions to strengthen teachers qualifications and working 
conditions, or awareness raising and information sessions that promote playful learning for young children at home, 
which supports the stimulation of learning in the family environment and which, in the event of local school closures 
(such as in the case of natural disasters or pandemics), offers a means of mitigating learning losses. 
Care should also be taken that tools are in placeto allows to maximise the impact of preschool reform on access to 
better quality education for all children, notably by (i) continuing the expansion of a network of high quality pre-
schools, (ii) improving the quality of educational processes and focusing on pedagogical practices in the classroom, 
and (iii) improving the measurement of children's cognitive and non-cognitive development. 
The present status of preschool educators must be reviewed in order to enhance and perpetuate the profession of 
educator, especially in rural areas, by providing bonuses to staff working in these precarious environments.

Abstract 
Lean manufacturing focuses on the concept of minimizing waste to maximize product value. Every line of business 
must have a goal to be able to produce good quality products in large quantities, but at the lowest possible cost. 
Magetan Regency, East Java is one of the most developed leather craft centers on the island of Java. UD. Praktis a 
center for leather shoes and sandals craftsmen who are able to produce 25-30 pairs of shoes every day. Based on the 
observations that have been made, the layout of the production room is inadequate so it looks quite messy. This 
resulted in the activity of waiting and moving raw materials and semi-finished materials. This activity is included in 
the category of waste. Initial identification uses Value Stream Mapping (VSM) which shows 32 minutes of non-value 
added activities. Furthermore, the potential causes are identified and sorted using a Pareto diagram. It is known that 
an inadequate layout has the highest frequency. Therefore, it is proposed to improve the layout of the facility in order 
to reduce the duration of production and activities that are non-value added.

Abstract 
The existence of technological and economic developments has led to a change in behavior patterns from consumers 
who originally made transactions using cash to non-cash. One that supports the change in behavior patterns of cash 
transactions to non-cash is the emergence of financial technology which is dominated by the use of e-wallet. The high 
use of non-cash transactions of the e-wallet type is caused by the number of service providers that have emerged, one 
of which is LinkAja. LinkAja is an e-wallet service provider in Indonesia which is a combination of several State-
Owned Enterprises (BUMN). Even though it has been supported by SOEs, the use of LinkAja's e-wallet itself in 
Indonesia is still below those of other e-wallet service competitors. One of the causes of this low usage is the low level 
of continuous use of LinkAja users. Therefore, the UTAUT 2 model is used which will determine factors can increase 
the frequency of use of technology. The purpose of this study is to determine factors that influence the frequency of 
using a financial technology of LinkAja e-wallet using six independent variables, namely performance expectancy, 
effort expectancy, social influences, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, and habit on the dependent variable 
of use behavior by looking at the influence of the intervening behavioral intention variable. The sample used was 262 
respondents conducted by LinkAja users and analyzed using SEM-PLS and the help of the third version of the 
SmartPLS 3.0 application. The results showed that all independent variables had a positive and significant effect on 
user behavior through mediating variable behavioral intention.

1. Introduction
At the beginning of its emergence, the payment system started with barter which in the end was no longer relevant to 
the business model and community traditions because the exchange rate between goods was still unclear (Bank 
Indonesia  2021). The increase in human needs makes the barter exchange system inefficient so that a more scalable 
payment system is developed, namely money, where the form of money itself continues to evolve until currency 
appears or commonly referred to as cash (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan  2019). However, due to technological and economic 
developments, transactions using cash are considered not practical enough because they have to carry a large amount 
of money and are not safe to carry (Ramadhani  2020). The shortage of cash has led to the emergence of new payment 
system innovations, namely non-cash payments such as electronic-based (electronic money), paper-based (cheques 
and demand deposits) and card-based (credit and debit cards), and electronic-based (electronic money) (OCBC NISP 
2021). The increasing use of electronic transactions is further strengthened by the data on a 63% decrease in cash use, 
which illustrates that there has been a change in consumer behavior patterns, especially in terms of payments 
(Mayasari  2021). The decline in the value of cash transactions is also supported by data showing a 53 percent 
reduction in Indonesian people's activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced economic activity, 
especially offline shopping and has shifted to online shopping (Lubis  2020). The increase in the number of online 
transactions by 300 percent also has an increasingly impact on the use of electronic transactions, especially e-wallets, 
which previously used cash to shop offline (Fatoni et al.  2021). 
Non-cash payments themselves are starting to be widely used by users for transactions where these forms of cash 
payments are credit cards, e-wallet applications, and debit cards so that making transactions easier (CIMB  2021). The

Based on Table 3 which contains the path coefficient value, it can be interpreted that all hypotheses are accepted which 
means that the frequency of using the LinkAja e-wallet is influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, and habit through interest in use. each independent 
variable increases, the frequency of using LinkAja increases indirectly through behavioral intention. In addition, the 
variable that has the greatest influence on increasing the frequency of use of the LinkAja e-wallet is facilitating 
conditions because it has the greatest path coefficient value. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In a direct relationship, namely behavioral intention, respondents consider LinkAja as a useful tool in helping daily 
activities and transactions. This convenience is supported by the infrastructure they have and the influence of their 
social environment. Therefore, they feel happy so they are accustomed to using the LinkAja e-wallet application and 
tend to use it in the future. For an indirect relationship, the results of the study indicate that the ease of making 
transactions using the LinkAja e-wallet application which can help daily activities using the facilities owned and with

the influence of the surrounding environment will create feelings of pleasure for LinkAja users so that it will lead to 
usage habits which initially triggered by the desire behavior first.

Abstract 
Public companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange must to issue their audited annual report to the public in a 
timely manner. Although the regulation regarding the limits for the issuance of audited annual report have been 
firmly established, there are still companies which experience delay in issuing their audited annual report. This 
delay is known as audit delay which calculated from the end of a company’s financial year until the audited 
annual report publication date. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of audit committee financial 
expertise, audit committee gender, institutional ownership, and audit effort on audit delay in LQ45 index 
companies for 2016-2020 period. The research method in this study is quantitative method with data collection 
techniques are performed through documentation and literature study. The sample selected through non 
probability sampling technique with purposive sampling method which produces 118 samples. The data analysis 
methods in this study are descriptive statistics, classical assumptions tests, and panel data regression analysis 
performed by EViews 12. According to the data analysis, all of the independent variables simultaneously 
influence the audit delay. Partially, institutional ownership has a positive influence on audit delay. Meanwhile, 
the audit committee financial expertise, audit committee gender, and audit effort has no influence on audit delay. 
This study can be an additional source for investors in knowing the condition of a company by considering the 
number of its institutional ownership. Companies are expected to consider and more selective of institutional 
investors who have opportunistic tendencies.

1. Introduction
Companies whose shares are listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) are obliged to submit audited annual 
report on time. This have to be done in the interest to maintain the quality of the information in the annual report 
itself which will be used as a principle in making various decisions for the future of the company and for 
investors. Otoritas Jasa Keuangan through POJK No. 29/POJK.04/2016 confirms that the deadline for submitting 
the audited annual report is at the end of the fourth month (120 days) after the financial year ends (Otoritas Jasa 
Keuangan 2016). If a public company violates this regulation, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan has the right to impose 
administrative sanctions or fines. Investors interpret the audited annual report as a signal that can reflect the 
company’s condition (Fitrianingsih and Triyanto, 2020). According to Margamiharja and Triyanto (2021), the 
annual report needs to be submitted transparently to the public to provide signals that can minimize information 
asymmetry between management and stakeholders and illustrate opportunities for the company in the future. 
Afriliana and Ariani (2020) explained, the signal can cause two kinds of reactions from investors, namely 
reactions to good news signal and reactions to bad news signal. Audited annual report that submitted on time is 
interpreted as a signal of good news, while audited annual report that experience audit delay more than the 
predetermined time is interpreted as bad news by investors. Reactions to such signals have the ability to influence 
the investors’ decision to invest in a company. 
This study used the LQ45 index companies for 2016-2020 period as the object of the research. The LQ45 index 
consists of 45 best stocks in the Indonesia capital market which determined based on liquidity and market

Hypothesis 4 stated that institutional ownership (IO) has an influence with a negative direction on audit delay 
(AD). This means the greater the institutional ownership will make the audit delay shorter, and vice versa. Table 
4 indicate that the coefficient value of the institutional ownership (IO) variable is 55.87113 with a significance 
level of 0.0206 which smaller than 0.05 (5%). The result show that hypothesis 4 is rejected, where institutional 
ownership (IO) has an influence with a positive direction on audit delay (AD). This result means the greater the 
institutional ownership has the ability to make the audit delay longer, and vice versa. The signaling theory have 
a linkage with the institutional ownership (IO) variable where the greater institutional ownership can cause audit 
delay longer so that investors assume the company giving a bad news signal to them, and vice versa. This can be 
caused since the greater institutional ownership can lead to higher opportunistic behavior of the institutional 
investors (Pradipta 2018). Greater institutional ownership means lower public ownership which then causes the 
information in a financial statement less transparent. According to Pradipta (2018), greater institutional 
ownership can cause scope restrictions in the implementation of the audit process. These restrictions can be due 
to the opportunistic behavior of the institutional investors which then causes auditor to experience various 
obstacles in obtaining audit evidence, which can extend audit delay. This result supports the research of Putri 
and Yusuf (2020) and Pradipta (2018). 
 
Hypothesis 5 stated that audit effort (AE) has an influence with a positive direction on audit delay (AD). This 
means the greater the audit effort proxied by the audit fee will make the audit delay longer, and vice versa. Table 
4 indicate that the coefficient value of the audit effort (AE) variable is 4.963493 with a significance level of 
0.0926 which greater than 0.05 (5%). This result show that hypothesis 5 is rejected, where audit effort (AE) has 
no influence on audit delay (AD). According to Xiao et al. (2020), audit effort is endogenous which can be 
influence by various factors from both the client and the external auditor. The more complex audit process needed 
can make greater effort required which can cause audit delay longer. However, in fact, in completing the audit 
process for a financial statement, auditor are required to be professional with high integrity (Pinatih and Sukartha 
2017). The auditor has to be able to complete their tasks in accordance with the client’s agreement. The size of 
the audit effort cannot be used as an excuse to not be professional by not completing the audited report as the 
agreement. The professionalism of the auditor must always be upheld in order to be able to fulfill the agreement 
between the auditor and the client. This causes the audit delay is not affected by the size of the audit effort. This 
result supports the research of Pinatih and Sukartha (2017) and Vuko and Cular (2014). 
 
Based upon the results of the tests which have been performed and discussed above, this study shows that the 
audit delay in LQ45 index companies for 2016-2020 period is influenced by the institutional ownership. 
Meanwhile, the audit committee financial expertise, audit committee gender, and audit effort do not influence 
the audit delay.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This study aims to discover the influence of independent variables, namely audit committee financial expertise, 
audit committee gender, institutional ownership, and audit effort on audit delay in LQ45 index companies for 
2016-2020 period. After data sampling is performed, 118 samples were obtained and used. The panel data 
regression method is used and random effect model is selected. The result of the regression analysis stated that 
all of the independent variables (audit committee financial expertise (ACFE), audit committee gender (ACG), 
institutional ownership (IO), and audit effort (AE)) have a simultaneous influence on audit delay (AD). Partially, 
only the institutional ownership (IO) variable can influence the audit delay (AD) in a positive direction, while 
the audit committee financial expertise (ACFE), audit committee gender (ACG), and audit effort (AE) variables 
have no influence on audit delay (AD). Based upon the result of the adjusted R2 test, it is known that the 
independent variables, namely audit committee financial expertise (ACFE), audit committee gender (ACG), 
institutional ownership (IO), and audit effort (AE) have the ability to explain the dependent variable, namely 
audit delay (AD) by 4.8%.  
 
This study has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this study can be a source of additional 
information in the theory development in association with the preparation of financial statement especially 
related to the factors that influence audit delay. This study can also be a reference for the future research in 
conducting research in the same field. Practically, this study can be a source of additional information for various 
parties, such as investors, to be a consideration when they want to invest in LQ45 index companies. Investors 
have to considers the institutional ownership in a company since it’s capable of influencing audit delay which 
can reflect the condition of a company. In addition, companies are expected to be more concern and selective

towards institutional investors that have a tendency of opportunistic behavior which can cause audit delay that 
can give a bad news signal to the investors about the company’s condition. For future research, it is advisable to 
add or use different variables, such as industry type, auditor industry expertise, and public ownership. 
Researchers are also expected to add research samples to reach the entire companies.

Abstract 
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic increasing e-marketplace implications for sellers and buyers, only a few MSME 
players in Pasar Baru Bandung have adopted Etapasbar as their e-marketplace. This study seeks what the most 
influential factor in adopting an e-marketplace is. 
This study was a quantitative cross-sectional study with the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) model, 
refined with the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) model. Technology Context will be IT Infrastructure; Organization 
Context will be CEO’s Innovativeness; Environment Context will be Government Support and Environmental 
Uncertainty. DOI model consists of Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Complexity, Trialability, and Observability. 
A self-completion survey was conducted by 300 MSME players in Pasar Baru Bandung and analyzed by LISREL 
using SEM techniques. 
This study found that the most influential factors were Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Trialability, Government 
Support, and Environmental Uncertainty. Complexity, Observability, IT Infrastructure, and CEO’s Innovativeness 
were insignificant in this study. It was because MSME players tend to follow others without knowing the essence of 
adopting e-marketplace itself.

1. Introduction
Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play an essential role in Indonesia’s economic growth (Hastuti et al., 
2020). The Indonesia Central Statistics Agency (2016) reported that MSME absorbs more than 90% of total workers 
in various business size and account for more than 50% of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Indonesia every 
year (TNP2K  2020). MSMEs are very difficult to define. In Indonesia, MSMEs can be seen based on annual turnover 
and the number of workers (Dhewanto et al. 2019). 
There is lots of benefit for an organization to grab its competitive advantage. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly 
encouraged MSMEs to adopt new technology (Priyono et al.  2020). Wang et al. (2011) stated that Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICTs) are essential in innovation’s rapid development and deployment. In addition, 
Ndou et al. (2009) stated that an online shopping platform is a crucial success factor in breaking the boundaries of 
opportunity connecting electronically with suppliers, customers, and business partners globally. LPEM FEB UI (2020) 
and Rakhmawati et al. (2021) compared e-commerce and online shopping before and during pandemic situations; the 
number increased for sellers and buyers. 
Pasar Baru Bandung is large-scale retail in Southeast Asia located in the middle of Bandung City (Sumadhinata et al., 
2021). The COVID-19 pandemic hit MSME players in Pasar Baru Bandung. Most of the goods and services in 
traditional markets in Indonesia are produced by MSMEs (Tambunan  2020). Etapasbar is an e-marketplace created 
by 11 MSME players in Pasar Baru Bandung to recover or even improve from this situation. According to CEO 
Etapasbar, there are 4600 MSME players in Pasar Baru Bandung, and only 1200 MSME players have adopted 
Etapasbar. However, establishing a digital marketplace is significant: reduced transaction costs and increased planning 
and audit capabilities. This benefit is handy for MSME players in developing countries as they are not restricted by 
global geography and can make a profit in digital markets that were previously unaffordable (Ndou et al.  2009).

Abstract 
Rapid development makes various activities easy to do, such as online transactions. Tokopedia and Shopee are e-
commerce which have dominated the market in Indonesia in recent years by becoming the top e-commerce ranking 
based on high website visits. The competition is quite competitive, so companies must be able to increase customer 
trust by providing the best service. One form of building a customer trust model is a factor that must be considered, 
one of which is the quality of the website. Therefore, the Tokopedia and Shopee websites require analysis for website 
quality based on the user's point of view whether the website has fulfilled the wishes and is satisfactory or not. The 
purpose of this study is to find out the sentiment or feedback given by users regarding the quality of the Tokopedia 
and Shopee websites based on the webqual dimensions obtained from User Generated Content (UGC) in the form of 
tweets and reviews on the Google Play Store. The results obtained based on sentiment analysis and the word cloud 
method to find out the dominant words that appear show that the quality of the websites from Tokopedia and Shopee 
is dominated by positive sentiment which according to data from users on Twitter social media and overall Google 
Play Store reviews are good. but still need improvement so that the quality can be maximized such as Usability or 
ease of use of the website and Information Quality or the quality of the website information submitted is still not good.

1. Introduction
The rapid development of technology makes various daily activities easier to do. The development of technology 
encourages us to use it very wisely. The convenience is felt by the community, one of which is to carry out buying 
and selling transactions that can be done flexibly. The place to make buying and selling transactions online is called 
e-commerce. E-commerce is a transaction carried out electronically in the absence of physical contact which includes
buying, selling, marketing of goods and services through electronic systems such as the internet (Prasetio et al.  2021).
Based on the Iprice.co.id survey data from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 Shopee still ranks first for the highest website visits
and Tokopedia is still ranked second. However, there was a change in position where in Q1 to Q2 2021 Tokopedia
became the first rank in the highest website. visitors. The quality of the number of customers who will decide to shop
online on the e-commerce (Fauziah & Wulandari  2018).

Figure 6. Shopee Word Cloud Result 
 
Figure 6. shows the results of the overall word cloud of , which the data cleaning process has carried out. It can be 
seen that the dominant words that appear are “aman”, “website”, “banget”, “gk”, “tolong”, “kurang”, “update”, 
“menarik”, “transaksi”, “shopee”. It can be interpreted that the words that appear still contain words that have a 
negative connotation which indicates that the quality of the Shopee website has not fully met the needs of users. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
Based on the analysis results from research on the quality of the Tokopedia and Shopee websites using the sentiment 
analysis method and doing a word cloud to get the dominant word that appears, it can be concluded that the answer to 
the problem formulation is as follows: 
The results of sentiment analysis on the quality of the e-commerce websites of Tokopedia and Shopee show that 
Tokopedia gets a percentage of 58% positive sentiment and 42% negative sentiment from a total of 400 datasets that 
have been processed previously. Meanwhile, Shopee gets a percentage of 60% positive sentiment and 40% negative 
sentiment from a total of 332 datasets that have been processed. 
 
The results of sentiment on the quality of the Tokopedia e-commerce website based on the webqual dimension show 
that the dimension that dominates the highest positive sentiment is the Interaction Quality dimension with a percentage 
of 40%, while the dimension that dominates the highest negative sentiment is the Usability dimension with a percentage 
of 50%. Therefore, it can be interpreted that Tokopedia has a website quality with Interaction Quality or good website 
interaction quality with users where this Interaction Quality includes security in transactions on the website, security 
in maintaining users' personal data to ease of communicating on Tokopedia. However, Tokopedia has a quality website 
with poor usability or ease of use on a website. This is in line with Meyliana research in 2018 which stated that the 
quality of the Tokopedia website had a slow access speed. 
 
The results of the sentiment on the quality of the Shopee e-commerce website based on the webqual dimension show 
that the dimension that dominates the highest positive sentiment is the Usability dimension with a percentage of 51%, 
while the dimension that dominates the highest negative sentiment is also the Usability dimension with a percentage 
of 64%. Therefore, it can be interpreted that Shopee has a quality website with good Usability or ease of use on the 
Shopee website but still needs to be improved because there are still many reviews with negative sentiments. This is 
also in line with Abdu'a & Wasiyanti's research in 2019 which stated that there are still users who are not accustomed 
to using the Shopee website because the operation is not very easy to use and the display also needs to be improved. 
Based on points A and B above, it can be concluded that from the two e-commerce sites that have better website 
quality, namely Shopee, the percentage of Shopee's positive sentiment is higher than Tokopedia. In addition, in each 
dimension, the positive percentage is also more dominated by Shopee compared to Tokopedia. 
 
Based on the word cloud that has been carried out, it is found that the dominant words that appear in each 
dimension are divided based on positive and negative sentiments on Tokopedia and Shopee indicating that 
the positive dominant words that appear in all dimensions are ""mudah"", ""menarik"", ""jelas"", ""sesuai"", ""aman"" 
which interprets that the quality of the website is quite good. While the dominant negative words that appear 
are ""update"", ""penipu"", ""gk"", ""mengecewakan"" which can be interpreted that there are also dimensions that 
need improvement and improvement so that the quality of the Tokopedia and Shopee websites can be better.

significant effect on employees. Moreover, the second hypothesis result is toxic workplace environment has been 
proven to have a positive and significant effect on job burnout. The third hypothesis result from the table above shown 
t-count value is 3.999 and the path coefficient is negative. So, it means job burnout has negative and significant effect 
on employee engagement. The fourth hypothesis in this study, the table above shows that the r-count value is 3.953 
this value is greater that the t-table value and has a negative path coefficient value. This meaning that toxic workplace 
environment is significant and influential to employee engagement and job burnout supports a mediation relationship.  
 
5.4 Discussion 
Toxic workplaces are generally characterized by a dysfunctional culture of interpersonal dynamics (Anjum et al., 
2018). This research results from the respondent data show that the company has the condition of toxic workplace 
environment that can have a negative effect on employee engagement. The results of this study are also in line with 
previous research by (Rasool et al., 2021) that if employees are in a toxic workplace environment they will spread 
negative feelings among other coworkers and affect employee engagement. Companies can implement a healthy 
workplace culture, namely harmonious co-workers, social cohesion, give a trust, and others (Jensen & van der Voordt, 
2020). Another thing is to implementing work-life balance concept. The benefits of work life balance are creating safe 
and healthy work practices, and increasing employee engagement also reduce unhealthy working condition (Chmiel 
et al., 2017).  
 
Job burnout can be described as a subliminal disorder caused by increased stress from work and bring various negative 
consequences for employees and the organization (Lubbadeh, 2020). Also, supported by research by (Santhanam & 
Srinivas, 2020) that job burnout can reduce the level of employee engagement in an organization. The role of human 
resource department is very important in this condition whereas this condition can be stated as an urgent condition 
that needs to be evaluated immediately (Santhanam & Srinivas, 2020). Based on interviews and observations of 
researchers at PT.XYZ, the respondents stated that it is very unfortunate if the role of human resource department has 
not run optimally because they felt that the HRD has been able to fix the existing problems.  
 
In the organization, there are various of tribes, habits, culture communication style of employee. Which is support 
them with different style of solving a problem. The HRD function is an important role to align employees in an 
organization. Things that can be don’t to increase employee dedication such as promotion to feel valued, provide 
constructive feedback, provide fairness in providing balanced material rewards, clarity in their work to help feel 
motivated, and provide adequate training to improve employee skill, and build full involvement (Ndibalem, 2020). 
These things above can support to increase employee engagement so hopefully can help the company to achieve its 
goals.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Toxic workplace environment at PT.XYZ in the medium category, it is known that the percentage average value of 
respondents’ responses to the toxic workplace environment variable represented by the statements in the questionnaire 
is 56.8%. Job burnout at PT.XYZ in the medium category, also known that the percentage average value of 
respondents’ responses to job burnout variable represented by the statements in the questionnaire is 53.4%. Therefore, 
employee engagement in the high category, known that the percentage average value of respondents’ response to 
employee engagement variable represented by the statements in the questionnaire is 74.8%. Based on the results of 
statistical testing, it is known that toxic workplace environment significantly influential 74.0% to employee 
engagement and job burnout support the relationship as mediating variable.

Abstract 
Timeliness is one of the indicators of relevant characteristics which means that the information in financial statements 
is ready to be used before it loses its meaning by users of financial statements, especially in making business decisions. 
The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), 
independent commissioner, managerial ownership, and operation complexity on timeliness of annual financial 
reporting. The population are energy sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 
period. The samples are 49 energy sector companies or 245 observation, was selected by purposive sampling method 
and using secondary data. The collected data in this research were analyzed using logistic regression. The findings 
provide evidence that XBRL, independent commissioner, management ownership, and operation complexity affects 
timeliness of financial reporting simultaneously, while only XBRL affects timeliness of financial reporting partially. 
It implies that the XBRL format improves the timeliness of financial reports. The timely provision of information by 
agents to principals can help principals to make business decisions.

1. Introduction
Financial reporting is intended as a form of management's responsibility for the company's business activities and 
provide benefits for users of financial statements in making future economic decisions. The main components of the 
characteristics of the relevance of accounting information is the timeliness of submitting financial statements (Sirajo 
et al. 2020). Timeliness is considered because delays in submitting financial statements will affect decision making 
by users of financial statements and financial information is considered irrelevant. The quality of the financial 
statement helps managers and shareholders in reducing information asymmetry and uncertainty, these are two issues 
that lead to conflict in companies (Alsmady 2018).  
The eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format is supposed to enhance the timeliness of submission of 
financial reporting. XBRL offers a number of benefits, including a more accurate and efficient report, as well as 
flexibility in how users can use the data in line with their needs and requirements (Tohang et al.2  020). 
The existence of independent commissioner is expected to ensure timely provision of financial reporting. Wahyuni 
(2020) argue that the existence of independent commissioners with a high percentage in the company will help to 
monitor management's opportunistic behavior, enhance the quality of disclosures in financial statements, and reduce 
the advantages of information concealment to ensure timely delivery of financial statements. 
The managerial ownership percentage is another factor that improve the timeliness of financial reporting. Kusuma & 
Nawangsari (2017) states that in companies with managerial ownership, managers who are also shareholders are also 
likely to be concerned with their interests as shareholders.

This result is in line with researches from Lestari et al. (2021) and Aksoy et al. (2021) which prove that XBRL format 
in financial reporting increase the timely submission of financial reports. 
 
Effect of Independent Commissioner on Timeliness of Financial Reporting 
The independent commissioner beta coefficient value of – 0.302 with a significance value of 0.876 > 0.05. It indicates 
that the existence of independent commissioner has a negative but not significant effect on timeliness of financial 
reporting, thus the hypothesis (H2) is rejected. This is not linear with agency theory, which Kristiantini and Sujana 
(2017) states that the existence of independent commissioners can improve the timely submission of financial reports 
and relate to the agency theory. Though in reality, not all companies comply with the Financial Services Authority 
Regulation Number 33/POJK.04/2014. This is because there are several companies that have proportion of 
independent commissioner under 30%. 
 
This result is linear with researches conducted by Wahyuni (2020) and Rivandi and Gea (2018) which states that 
existence of independent commissioner within company not influence the timeliness of financial reports. 
 
Effect of Managerial Ownership on Timeliness of Financial Reporting 
The managerial ownership beta coefficient value of 53.323 with a significance value of 0.256 > 0.05. It indicates that 
the managerial ownership percentage has a positive but not significant effect on timeliness of financial reporting, thus 
the hypothesis (H3) is rejected. This is not in line with agency theory, which Kristiantini and Sujana (2017) states that 
the managerial ownership can align the interests of the principal and the agent, thus reducing conflict of interest and 
agency problems. 
 
This result is in line with researches from Sirajo et al. (2020) and Alsmady (2018) which states that managerial 
ownership percentage not impact the timeliness of financial reporting. 
 
Effect of Operation Complexity on Timeliness of Financial Reporting 
The operation complexity beta coefficient value of – 18.345 with a significance value of 0.998 > 0.05. It indicates that 
the operation complexity has a negative but not significant effect on the timeliness of financial reporting, thus the 
hypothesis (H4) is rejected. This is not in line with agency theory, because companies with complex operations tend 
to increase agency problems, thus the company with the operation complexity has a negative impact and tend to submit 
financial reports on the longer time. 
 
This result is in line with researches conducted by Sujarwo (2019) and Nurlen et al. (2021) which prove that operation 
complexity not impact the timeliness of financial reporting. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research aims to investigate the effects of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), independent 
commissioner, managerial ownership, and operation complexity on timeliness of annual financial reporting. The 
information were obtained from the annual reports of energy sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
for the 2016-2020 period. Based on the logistic regression and research analysis results, it can be concluded that 
XBRL, independent commissioner, managerial ownership, and operation complexity affects timeliness of financial 
reporting simultaneously. Meanwhile only XBRL format that has a significant effect on the timeliness of financial 
reporting partially and the other independent variables has not significant effect on the timeliness of financial reporting 
partially. 
 
Based on the research results, there are several research implications. First, this research is expected to inform 
investors that financial information of energy sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange can be 
accessed via XBRL format. Second, the research results are expected to be a reference as a recommendation for 
companies, especially energy sector companies, that the XBRL format can provide accuracy and reliable information, 
faster data access, and can help the stakeholder to make business decision. Third, the results are also expected to be 
used as a reference to better comply with the Financial Services Authority Regulations regarding the timeliness of 
financial reporting and independent commissioners.

The research measure the timeliness of financial reporting by dummy variable, thus future research may uses another 
formula to measure the timeliness of financial reporting. This study will provide empirical evidence using the logistic 
regression technique, which has not been used in other studies in Indonesia. Further research could examine other 
independent variables such, audit quality and family firms on timeliness of financial reporting either in another sector 
from Indonesia Stock Exchange with another period.

Abstract 
The food and beverage business is one of the world's most rapidly developing industries, including in Indonesia. 
This research was carried out to test the influence of Business Strategy, Asset Management and Capital Structure on 
Financial Performance in food and beverage firms recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2018-2020. 
This research used a quantitative approach with panel data regression analysis method. The independent variables in 
this study are Business Strategy (METSR), Asset Management (TATO) and Capital Structure (DER). While the 
dependent variable in this study is financial performance (ROA). The results showed that simultaneously Business 
Strategy (METSR), Asset Management (TATO), and Capital Structure (DER) had a significant effect on Financial 
Performance.  Partially, Business Strategy (METSR) and Asset Management (TATO) have no effect on Financial 
Performance, while DER, on the other hand, has a favorable and considerable impact on financial performance.

1. Introduction
The food and beverage business is one of the world's most rapidly developing industries, including in Indonesia, 
according to the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia in 2021, The food and beverage industry is one 
of the sectors that gets development precedence, including being encouraged to apply industrial technology 4.0. 
Based on data from the food and beverage industry's growth in 2018-2020, the financial performance of the food and 
beverage industry always increases amid the continued decline in the level of household consumption. The Ministry 
of Industry noted that the financial performance of the food and beverage industry during the 2020 period was still 
able to grow positively by 1.58% at a time when the national economic growth rate   decreased.  The increase in 
financial performance is inversely proportional to   the decline in national economic growth and the level of 
household consumption.  This shows that the decline in national economic growth and the level of public 
consumption does not always affect the company's financial performance.  The increasing financial performance of 
a company has a good impact on the company.

performance of food and beverage sub-sector companies  recorded on the  Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the  
2018-2020 period. 
It is known from 75 samples, there were 32 samples with an above-average asset management value consisting of 16 
samples with financial performance values above the average and the remaining 16 samples with financial 
performance values below the average. Meanwhile, of the 43 samples that had an asset management value below the 
average, there were 14 samples that had above-average financial performance values and the remaining 29 samples 
had  below-average financial performance values.  The results showed that the highest number of samples was found 
in data samples that had an asset management value below the average with a financial performance value below the 
average. This indicates that an increase or decrease in the value of asset management has no effect on the value of 
financial performance. The results of this study mean that the company has a low ability to utilize all its assets, this is 
due to  most  of the  companies  studied not being able to maintain the value of the  assets they own in order to remain 
high and cause the value of its assets to fluctuate or not be persistent, so as not to affect financial  performance. 
 
Although the results of this study do not support the researcher's initial premise, they do support the findings of 
previous studies by (Dewi et al., 2019) with the result that asset management (TATO) has no influence on financial 
performance, the findings of the study conducted by (Pardosi & Siagian, 2021) also showed results in line that asset 
management does not affect the company's financial  performance (ROA). 
 
The Effect of Capital Structure on Financial Performance 
Based on Table 4.11 shows that the coefficient of the capital structure variable of positive value is 0.065677 with a 
probability value of 0.0405. The probability value obtained is smaller than the significance level of 0.05, so it can be 
concluded that the capital structure partially has a significant positive influence on the financial performance of food 
and beverage sub-sector companies recorded on the   Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the  2018-2020 period. 
It is known from 75 samples, there were 32 samples with above-average capital structure values consisting of 7 
samples with financial performance values above the average and the remaining 25 samples with financial 
performance values below the average. Meanwhile, of the 43 samples that had below-average asset management 
values, 23 samples had above-average financial performance values and the remaining 20 samples had below-average 
financial performance values. Research shows that the highest number of samples is found in data samples with a 
capital structure value above average and a financial performance value below average.  This shows that the higher 
the value of the Capital Structure owned by the company, the lower the value of the financial performance of the 
company. When the capital structure is above average, financial performance tends to be below average, according to 
the data. This is because the company is indicated to have excessive debt.  If the company's financial performance 
continues to decline, it will cause the company's condition to look bad and can make the company go bankrupt. 
 
This research supports the researcher's initial premise and is consistent with the findings of previous studies by 
(Ningsih & Utami, 2020) with the results of  capital structure having a significant effect on   performance financial, 
the results of research conducted by (Das & Swain, 2018) also show results  in line  that a company's capital structure 
has a big impact on its financial performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study analyzes the effect of business strategy, asset management, and capital structure on the financial 
performance of food and beverage companies recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2018-2020. The 
results found in this study are that business strategy, asset management, and capital structure simultaneously affect 
the financial performance of the food and beverage industry recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2020, 
while partially business strategy and asset management have no effect on financial performance, capital structure has 
a favorable impact on financial performance. This research is anticipated to add to the existing literature.  The authors 
suggest subsequent studies to add other variables not used in the study as well as select other sectors. Companies 
should pay attention to the factors that influence their financial performance, such as lowering the capital structure's 
value to increase financial performance to the utmost extent possible.  For investors, the results of this study can be a 
consideration for investing their capital. Researchers suggest that investors can pay attention to the low Capital 
Structure so that the company’s value becomes large and in good condition. This is based on the study's results that 
capital structure affects financial performance so that potential investors can consider it in making decisions.

Abstract 
Dividend policy refers to a company's choice to distribute a portion of its profits to shareholders as a return on invested 
equity. The distribution of dividends to investors by company management has a significant effect on the company's 
value. This study seeks to determine the effect of the independent variables, namely leverage (DER), liquidity (CR), 
investment opportunity set (MBVE), free cash flow (FCF), and asset growth (AG) on the dependent variable, namely 
dividend policy (DPR) on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-2020. The 
population in this study includes mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2017 
to 2020 using a purposive sampling technique. The samples obtained were ten samples with a study period of four 
years and obtained the results of 40 research data. The method used was panel data regression analysis. The results 
reveal that leverage (DER) had a significant negative effect on dividend policy. Whereas liquidity (CR), free cash 
flow (FCF), and asset growth (AG) did not have a significant negative effect on dividend policy as well as investment 
opportunity set (MBVE) but in a positive direction. 
Keywords: 
Asset Growth, Dividend Policy, Free Cash Flow, Investment Opportunity Set, Leverage, liquidity. 
1. Introduction
According to the Law No. 4 of 2009 concerning Mining, Mineral, and Coal, Mining is part or all of the activities in 
the structure of research, management, and development of minerals or coal, including general assessments, problem 
deepening, feasibility studies, forms of mining, cultivation, and purification, transmission, sales, and all activities after 
mining. Mining sector companies play a crucial role for the state because of their ability to manage energy sources 
that can be used by the community later. In addition, the industrial, agricultural, trade, construction, and mining sectors 
account for 65% of Indonesia's total national production (GDP). In other words, the mining industry is a strong area 
that contributes significantly to the Indonesian economy. 
This study seeks to discuss the factors influencing dividend policy, which is considered to be one of the determining 
factors in determining dividend policy on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 
2017-2020 period. Narindro & Basri (2019) revealed that Indonesia's government, being a developing country, 
requires substantial funding to support its development. To accelerate economic development, the government must 
generate income from various sources. One of the potential sources of funding can be dividends from government-
owned companies. Pre-determined dividend payments are thought to be a tool for securing the state budget, but they 
can also affect the ability of government-owned companies to grow. Likewise, the main reason investors invest in a 
2425","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

regression coefficient of investment opportunity set (X3) of 0.087201. These results were not in line with the 
hypothesis. The results show that the majority of the companies studied are already mature, meaning that the 
company's primary focus is on generating profits and distributing them to shareholders. At this mature stage, the 
company already has a profit reserve that can be used as investment capital without having to reduce the dividend 
proportion for shareholders (Sugiyanto et al., 2021). 
5. 
The probability value of free cash flow (X4) was 0.5437, which was greater than 0.05, meaning that free cash 
flow partially did not have a negative effect on dividend policy because it had a regression coefficient value of -
0.299119 for free cash flow (X4). This result was not in accordance with the hypothesis. Khan & Shamim (2017) 
observe a negative relation of free cash flow and dividend due to the fact that most of the free cash flow available 
is utilized by the companies for investment growth.  
6. 
The probability value of asset growth (X5) was 0.0808, which was greater than 0.05, meaning that asset growth 
partially did not have a negative effect on dividend policy because it had an asset growth regression coefficient 
value (X5) of -0.718901. Asset growth has no effect on the cash dividend paid to the shareholders. This indicates 
that the growth of the companies did not constitute a higher dividend payment to the investors (Narindro & Basri, 
2019). This finding does not support our earlier stated hypothesis. This could mean that asset growth is not an 
important determinant of the dividend behavior of Indonesian Government-owned companies. In other words, it 
may suggest that dividend decisions are taken independently from companies’ growth.  
7. 
Table 5 shows that the adjusted R-squared value was 0.328855 or 32.88%. Thus the independent variables 
consisting of leverage, liquidity, investment opportunity set, free cash flow and asset growth could affect the 
dependent variable, namely dividend policy, which was 32.88%, while the remaining 67.12% was influenced by 
other variables outside of this study.  
 
Conclusion 
This study has examined the factors that influence the dividend policy on mining sector companies listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-2020. Based on ten mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange that have passed the research sample criteria, this study discovered that leverage, liquidity, investment 
opportunity set, free cash flow, and asset growth had a simultaneous effect on dividend policy. Partially, leverage had 
a significant positive effect on dividend policy, while liquidity, free cash flow, and asset growth did not have a 
significant negative effect on dividend policy. Likewise, the investment opportunity set did not have a significant 
positive effect on dividend policy. In particular, the results of the study show that companies with high income and 
investment opportunities but have low debt tended to pay higher dividends to shareholders.  
 
This study are expected to assist the board of directors in developing and/or improving the company's dividend policy 
by considering factors that have been proven to have a significant effect on dividend payments. In particular, if the 
board of directors is considering increasing dividend payments to shareholders, the leverage factor needs to be 
considered more carefully. This is vital since dividend policy is one of the most important factors in maintaining 
current investors and attracting new investors to invest in the company. In addition to paying high dividends to the 
management team, it is also crucial to seek more income and investment opportunities, as well as reduce debt levels, 
in order to satisfy the shareholders' goal of increasing wealth through higher dividends. 
 
Since dividend payments are a form of reward or return to shareholders, the results of this study also provide insight 
to existing and potential shareholders in making investment decisions. If they expect to receive more dividends from 
their investments, shareholders may invest in large companies with better profitability and lower debt, as well as a 
higher proportion of investment by major shareholders.  
 
This research has several limitations. First, it merely focuses on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange in 2017-2020, which consistently paid dividends to their shareholders annually during the study. Future 
research could include companies from sectors other than mining listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange with a longer 
research period in order to generalize the findings and represent the determinants of dividends on mining sector 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Second, this study relies solely on secondary data, such as financial 
statements and annual reports from companies, as well as literary studies from books and previous research 
publications. The use of questionnaires or qualitative studies, such as interviews, is suggested to provide more 
complete data about the factors that influence a company's dividend policy. It can also be done by combining 
quantitative and qualitative research methods to obtain more comprehensive results. Despite its limitations, this study

Abstract 
Despite the international efforts to promote the circular economy and waste recycling, landfilling is still a common 
practice for waste disposal around the world, with considerable impacts on the environment and public health. 
However, while such a sector was addressed in many countries through a consistent environmental legislative 
framework, safety management for workers in landfills has not been sufficiently considered by policymakers. 
Moreover, in the scientific literature OHS issues related to landfill management were not deeply addressed through 
the elaboration of specific procedures. 
Hence, with the goal to evaluate the existence of specific risk profiles in such working contexts, the paper provides a 
contribution through a data-driven approach. In fact, the study contains a detailed investigation of the biggest Italian 
occupational accident database (powered by INAIL) with reference to the landfill management sector, according to a 
methodology specifically designed to employ the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) codes as data 
filters. After selecting a sample of n.78 accidents, likely to have occurred in Italian landfills in the period 2008/2019, 
accidents’ dynamics were assessed for each event with reference to the use of work equipment. The results achieved 
allowed us to bring to light the potential risks related to this determinant. Thus, potential risk management measures 
were defined in order to improve the safety management of work equipment in this specific context.

1. Introduction
In March 2020 European Commission adopted the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), with the aim to 
prevent waste production (European Commission, 2020). This plan has been promoted according to the sustainable 
development goal 12.5 stated by UN Agenda 2030, addressing waste prevention and recycling (United Nations   2015). 
But, in the meanwhile, in many European and high-income countries of the world waste landfilling still remains an 
important disposal practice, both for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and industrial waste, as shown in figure 1. The 
same could be argued with reference to low-income countries, where open dumpsites and uncontrolled landfills are a 
matter of serious concern, especially for industrial waste (Kaza et al. 2018; Ferronato and Torretta  2019). 
As reported by (Limoli et al. 2019), landfills are responsible for the emission of hazardous gases, dust and leachate in 
the environment, due to waste bio-chemical degradation. Such emissions were accounted in literature to cause serious 
impacts on environment and public health (Mazza et al.  2015; Triassi et al.  2015; Njoku et al.  2019; Vaverková, 
2019; Fazzo et al. 2020). Hence, during the years a consistent legislative framework has been developed to avoid/limit 
waste impacts on environment and public health due to landfilling operations (Lombardi et al. 2021). Just to make 
some examples, in 1976 in the U.S.A the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act provided criminal punishment for 
bad waste disposal. In Europe, Directive 1999/31/CE (updated in 2018) addressed disparities in technical standards 
for landfills construction and management, providing common project and monitoring features. Moreover, in the 
2435",,"Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

• 
falling materials, road accidents, falling from the height and contact with sharps were identified as potential 
risks for other workers in landfills. 
Starting from risk profiling, some mitigation measures were suggested according to the hierarchy of controls stated in 
ISO 45001. However, the critical discussion of results brought in light that further research is needed to promote data 
driven approaches of risk assessment and management in such field. In fact, current organizational models for 
accidents at work partially limit risk assessment from data analysis.

Abstract 
According to recent analyses, it has been found that the motorization rate, which has risen to 66.6 vehicles per 100 
inhabitants, is reflected in worsening traffic conditions in cities. As a result of the pandemic, awareness of the 
sanitation problem has grown and private vehicles have been preferred for travel at the expense of public transport 
and sharing. In response to this negative trend, European policies have also moved to incentivize and innovate more 
sustainable mobility. For this reason, the developed project aims to achieve more connected mobility and more 
comprehensive environmental, social and economic sustainability. The proposed vehicle offers a new way of getting 
around the city, reducing the importance of private car use. It appeals to a wide audience since it can be used without 
a license and by people with disabilities independently. Following the IDeS method, the object was the development 
of an inclusive and sustainable self-driving urban micromobility vehicle, and through the application of innovative 
methodologies, it was possible to analyze the state of the art of the segment under consideration, arriving at the design 
of a vehicle that goes to fill the gaps in urban mobility. These design methodologies, characterized by the combination 
of different techniques used in the industry, made it possible to create a design that goes to solve the problems of travel 
in the near future and create new opportunities for mobility.

Abstract 
Effective management of warehouse operations is critical not only for reducing response time and inbound costs, but 
also for its potential impact on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This case study fronts location allocation 
problem is fronted using an evolutionary Genetic algorithm to explore the mutual impact of travel time, total inbound 
costs and CO2 emissions. The research is developed within the finished products warehouse of an automotive 
industry, analyzing the operations for the whole warehouse cycle, including the arrival of dirty containers/component-
boxes, storage, cleaning, re-storage and delivery of cleaned containers/boxes. The solutions are explored by solving 
the integer programming model developed for travel time, inbound costs and CO2 emissions. Then, within the location 
allocation problem the study is augmented with the priorities’ options for the containers, to explore the three different 
perspectives of optimizing travel time, inbound costs or CO2 emission. Results highlight the possibilities of 
concurrent improvement for these objectives with significant decreasing of all three parameters, i.e. time, cost and 
CO2 emissions. There is a reduction in costs of 54.43%, a reduction in time of 79.49% and a reduction in CO2 
emissions of 54.16%. A sensitivity analysis is further carried out to assess how the variation of these parameters 
impacts on the optimal solution.

1. Introduction and literature review
Warehouse is one of the important parts of logistics and supply chain management of today’s competitive market, 
playing the key role of a buffer between customers and the producer. Albeit warehouses usually store components or 
products for a short time-period, their operations involve almost 20% of the total logistics cost (Ene & Öztürk, 2012). 
Among warehouse operations, the location/allocation of the inventory plays a critical role in inventory management 
and picking operations. According to (Tompkins et al., 2010), more than 50% of the time is involved between location 
of the goods in warehouse and arrival/departure points. 
The efficiency of the inventory-placement/order-picking operations of a warehouse can be enhanced by improving 
location assignment and storage strategy. The frequency of replenishment and order may vary from one product to 
another. In such a scenario, the location assigned to the products determines the distance travelled during placement 
and picking operations, thus impacting on lead time and total costs. The typical approaches used to minimize distance 
travelled, lead time, and energy consumption during placement/picking operations are: (i) optimizing 
placement/picking route, (ii) zoning, (iii) storage placement allocation considering optimized shelves usage, and (iv) 
batching.

Figure 10. Trend of optimal lead-time values when the pallet cleaning time varies 
 
Warehouse management is crucial and it may affect the value chain to a high extent. The scope of optimal storage 
location allocation further increases considering green principles and environmental protection and assume on an 
increasingly important role within industries. 
 
The results of SA shown in table 4 answers to RQ1 which the optimization of warehouse operations not only 
minimizes the cost but also the negative impact on environment by reducing CO2 emissions in the environment. In 
addition to cost and CO2 emission, the time taken by a product in a warehouse also becomes critical if selected 
warehouse deals with components and/or containers used to carry these components as delay may lead to stoppage of 
production and ultimately, production loss. 
 
The developed models for travel distance/time, CO2 emissions and cost of the not automated warehouse operations 
allow us to optimize SA fulfilling all three objectives simultaneously. As CO2 emissions calculation is done based on 
energy consumption, the minimization of CO2 emissions would also lead to minimization of cost of fuel used for 
handling operations and ultimately, lower energy consumption. Furthermore, the alignment of objectives allows the 
managers for improvement without compromise on other objectives, i.e. concurrent optimization.  
 
The results from the sensitivity analysis presented in Figures 8, 9, 10 respond to RQ2, highlighting how the variation 
in cost, CO2 emissions and cleaning time impact on optimal solutions. The impact of increase in workload, i.e. number 
of containers per unit time (both dirty and cleaned) on cost, time and CO2 emissions is depicted in Figure 7. Increase 
in number of containers per hours to be handled increases number of trips of the forklifts, leading to an increase in 
fuel consumption, and consequently costs and CO2 emissions. Increase in number of containers per hour also 
increases the cleaning workload and, with the same resources, average time taken by each palette for cleaning and 
movement. 
 
Figure 6 presents the results of the simultaneous optimization considering the priorities of the management and shows 
that the developed models optimize all three objectives at the same time. The results may vary if the conditions of the 
input parameters are different. 
 
From managerial perspective, the developed models can also be implemented in warehouses used for finished goods 
inventory. As SA plays a major role in optimizing (i) travel distance/time, (ii) energy consumption, (iii) cost, and (iv) 
CO2 emissions, the developed mono-objectives can be used individually or in combination, according to the 
requirements. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This study considers a multiple objectives of minimizing cost, time and CO2 emissions in a warehouse used for 
storage and cleaning of products’ containers. These objectives are achieved by optimizing storage allocation to

minimize travel distance. The storage allocation models are derived based on cost, time, and CO2 emission. The 
proposed models are solved using Genetic Algorithm to find optimum storage allocation. The models are implemented 
on an automotive industry for case application. The results depict that the proposed mechanism can be implemented 
to find optimal storage allocation in any warehouse of an automotive industry. This study contributes to extant body 
of literature by minimizing cost, time and CO2 emissions at the same time.  
The results show that substantial can be achieved using proposed mechanism. It also helps in minimizing time taken 
by the pallet in warehouse. In addition, the decrease in travel distance decreases fuel consumption which leads to 
reduced CO2 emissions in the environment.  
The developed models are implemented on a warehouse containing empty containers. The implementation can be 
extended to a warehouse used for storage of components or finished products. The implementation to an automated 
warehouse will also be interesting. In addition, the considered warehouse comprises only storage lanes and no picking 
aisles.

1. Introduction
Higher education institutes (HEI) around the world have been undergoing many changes and experiencing numerous 
obstacles in changing the educational system in the wake of the worldwide pandemic. Covid-19. HEIs are fully aware 
that the traditional delivery form of education will undergo a transformation to improve students' learning experiences 
through the use of high-tech means. 
These developments had a variety of repercussions and reactions from various perspectives. This  research examines 
the consequences and outcomes of distance learning and teaching via online media that occurred during the academic 
years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 because of Covid-19's health restrictions. In this paper, the differences in learning 
techniques, students' perspectives on new teaching methods, and, most importantly, the impact these new methods have 
on students' learning and studying attitudes, will be examined. Furthermore, the efficiency and effectiveness of online 
teaching during the epidemic using real data will be assessed. 
Data will be gathered through specially designed surveys which will be distributed to students to fill up in order to have

undergo a transformation to improve students' learning experiences through the use of high-tech means. The main 
objective of this research is to evaluate and understand the effect of online teaching on the learning experience of 
students and how recorded lectures availability is reflecting on the students’ educational experience when relying on 
the recordings thus reducing direct interaction during live classes. The impact of extent of ease on teaching experience 
of instructors has been found to be significant as the value of significance is less than 0.05, the impact of attention, 
online learning and recordings are significant as well, as the value of significance is less than 0.05 as well. However, 
the impact of factors of problems is insignificant on the teaching experience of the instructors, as the value of 
significance is equal to 0.565. Furthermore, the influences of insecurity and recorded lectures on the experience of the 
instructors are significant as well.

Abstract 
The sustainability of the supply chain has emerged as a major concern that is getting a lot of attention nowadays. and 
supplier selection can be optimizing the overall value of the supply chain in maintaining the company’s profitability 
and sustainability. In the healthcare section, greater attention to maximizing revenue and less attention is paid to 
sustainability in the organization. Furthermore, the effect of the important weight of sub-criteria on the Fuzzy TOPSIS 
approach was not attempted in the field of choosing a hospital supplier. To address this problem, this research conducts 
a new Fuzzy TOPSIS approach to examine the considerable influence of sub-criteria for sustainable hospital supplier 
problems, which sub-criteria and criteria for sustainability in this hospital environment are employed by the argument 
of decision-makers. Based on a comprehensive literature study and the perspectives of decision-makers; there are 
twenty-four sub-criteria and ten of their criteria confirmed the validity of evaluating the three hospital supplies. In 
addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the proposed framework by implying a change in the different 
criteria and decision-makers. As the results show that suppler one is the best sustainable supplier in most scenarios. 
Alternatively, if the hospital supplier selection process is considered only economic criteria, aiming to maximize 
revenue, this issue suggested supplier two is the best performance ranking. This research suggested frameworks can 
help hospital managers make decisions on potential suppliers within the sustainability dimensions of their supply chain 
operations and practices.

1. Introduction
Supply chain sustainability refer to the strategic and methodical management of an enterprise’s internal operations 
and the enterprise’s supply chain in order to increase long-term benefits (Mentzer et al. 2001). The sustainability 
performance of a company should not focus solely on increasing shareholder profits, the company should pay attention 
to the object of everyone or stakeholders (Tseng et al. 2020). Furthermore, the company is expected to meet full 
sustainability while taking into account the triple bottom line (TBL) of these criteria altogether, such as economic, 
social, and environmental dimensions (Sivarajah et al. 2020). Moreover, sustainability in the supply chain has become 
one of the most popular problems among researchers over the last 20 years and a major issue that is getting a lot of 
attention nowadays. There are so many strategies to maintain the company’s sustainability and profitability including 
product development, supplier selection, sustainable manufacturing, sustainable transportation, etc. (Li et al. 2019). 
However, the best decision is supplier selection for enhancing the supply chain’s overall value (Zhou & Xu 2018) and 
critical strategic decisions to maintain the company's profitability and long-term existence (Shaw et al. 2012).  
Recently, sustainable supplier selection has shown an increased interest in solving various industries, although this 
range of studies implemented in the healthcare sector has limitations. To determine which method to employ, one 
must match up the specifics of the current situation with the features of the method (Ertuğrul and Karakaşoğlu 2008). 
For a situation of supplier selection, the method that needs to employ should consider the five factors including 
sufficient to support the group decision-maker, adaptation to modifications in criteria and alternatives, performs 
quickly interact with decision-maker in data collection, the complexity of computation, and decision-making capture 
uncertainty (Lima Junior et al. 2014). Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) are an effective technique for dealing 
with contradictory tangible and intangible criteria for deciding on the right supplier for selecting suppliers 
(Kirytopoulos et al. 2008; Shahin et al. 2017). Among MCDM methods, the Fuzzy TOPSIS method followed five 
factors that were proposed above. Moreover, the effect of the influent sub-criteria on the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique for 
hospital supplier selection was not investigated. Hence, a new Fuzzy TOPSIS technique is developed in this study to

Abstract 
This research aims to determine the influence of Intellectual Capital (IC) and Good Corporate Governance (GCG) on 
profitability in conventional commercial banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2015-2019.  Independent 
variables in this study are intellectual capital consisting of Value Added Capital Employed (VACA), Value Added 
Human Capital (VAHU), and Structural Capital Value Added (STVA) and Good Corporate Governance (GCG). 
While the dependent variable in this study is profitability.  This research uses a quantitative approach with the panel's 
data regression analysis method. The results found in this study are that IC and GCG simultaneously affect proftability, 
while partially VACA and VAHU have a positive effect on profitability, STVA has no effect on profitability, and 
GCG negatively affects profitability.

1. Introduction
Conventional banks according to Law No. 10 of 1998 concerning Banking are banks that carry out conventional 
business activities that in their activities provide services in payment traffic .  Based on data from  Indonesia  Banking 
Statistics, in  2015-2019 the number of conventional commercial banks and the number of conventional commercial 
bank branches decreased every year. However, the decline in the number of conventional commercial banks is 
inversely proportional to the  total  growth of  third-party  funds raised  by banks.  This shows that the decline in the 
number of conventional commercial banks does not affect public  confidence in banking in carrying out its function, 
namely to raise funds in the form of current accounts, savings, and or deposits. With the high level of public confidence 
in banking has a good impact on the profitability of banks and contributes to improving the national economy.

From 165 samples, there were 88 samples with above-average VAHU values consisting of 78 samples with ROA 
values above average and the remaining 10 samples with below average ROA values. While of the 77 samples that 
had below average VAHU values, there were 13 samples that had ROA values above average and the remaining 64 
samples had ROA values below average.  The results showed that the highest number of samples was found in data 
samples that had above-average VAHU values with above average ROA values.  This shows that the higher the human 
capital owned by the  company, the higher the profitability value or ROA of the company.  Human capital provides 
added value  or value added to the company through human  resources with all the knowledge, skills, abilities, talents, 
experience, and motivation and commitment to organization and its values to implement the  company's strategy.  The 
company's ROA value can increase if the company is able to make good use of human capital  because human capital 
contributes to the company in generating profits. The results of this study are in line with previous research  conducted 
by Meles et al.  (2016), 
Saraswati & NR (2018), and Kazhimy & Sulasmiyati (2019) stated that VAHU has a positive effect on profitability. 
VAHU can be an overview of the company's performance in managing its human   resources to achieve efficient 
profits (Saraswati and  NR, 2018). 
4.2.3 The Effect of Structural Capital Value Added (STVA) on Profitability 
Based on the test results in table 4.12, STVA has a probability value of 0.4488 > 0.05 with a coefficient of -
0.000841, it can be interpreted that the STVA variable has no effect on profitability in conventional commercial 
banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2015 - 2019. 
It is known from 165 samples, there are 62 samples that have STVA values above the average consisting of 44 samples 
with ROA values above average and the remaining 18 samples with ROA values  below average.  While of the 103 
samples that had STVA values  below average, there were 47 samples with ROA values above average and the 
remaining 56 samples had ROA values below average.  The results  showed that the highest number of samples  was 
found in data samples that had   below-average STVA  values with  below-average ROA  values.   This indicates that 
the rise or decrease of STVA indigo has  no effect on ROA values. The company cannot increase profitability with 
the funds spent on SC. SC is a support component of HC to maximize performance in the company.  SC is a component 
consisting of information systems, databases, organizational processes and procedures, and the infrastructure needed 
to support the implementation of organizational strategies (Sumedrea  2013).  Value added  generated  from HC in 
conventional  commercial banks has a large value, therefore SC contribution to produce value added will be smaller. 
The results of this study are in line with Febrianty & Febriantoko (2018) which states that STVA has no effect on 
profitability. 
4.2.4 The Effect of Good Corporate Governance on Profitability 
Based on the test results in table 4.12, GCG has a probability value of 0.0002 < 0.05 with a coefficient of -0.011029, 
it can be interpreted that the GCG variable negatively affects profitability in conventional  commercial banks listed 
on  the   Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2015– 2019. 
It is known from 165 samples, there are 26 samples that have above-average GCG values consisting of 2 samples with 
ROA values above average and the remaining  24 samples with ROA values below average. While of the 139 samples 
that have below  average GCG values, there are 89 samples that have ROA values above average and the remaining 
50 samples have ROA values below average.  The results  showed that the highest number of samples  was found in 
data samples that had below-average GCG values with above-average ROA values. This shows that the smaller the 
GCG value of a company, the higher the  ROA value  in the  company.  The company that has the maximum ROA 
value in 2015, namely PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia Agro Niaga Tbk, has a value or GCG rating below the average, 
which is 2,0000. In 2016-2019, PT Bank Central Asia Tbk has a maximum  ROA  value with a GCG value below the 
average of 1,0000 and 2,0000. The results of this study are in line with previous research conducted by Shidieq & 
Yuliandari (2015) which stated that GCG negatively affects profitability. 
5. Conclusion
The results  found in this  study are value added capital employed, value added human capital, structural capital value 
added, and good corporate governance simultaneously affect  profitability in conventional commercial banks listed. 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange  in  2015-2019.  While  partially, VACA and VAHU have a positive effect  on 
profitability, STVA has no effect on profitability, and GCG has a negative effect  on profitability.  This research  is

expected  to add to the existing literature.  However, the authors suggest future studies to add other variables not used 
in the study as well as choose other sectors.   For companies, it is recommended to pay attention to  factors that affect 
the company's profitability, namely by increasing the value added capital employed, value added human capital, and  
lowering the  value of good corporate. Governance to get maximum profitability. For investors, it is recommended 
before making a decision in investing in order to pay attention to the  value added capital employed and the high value 
added of human capital and low good corporate governance rating. This is based on the results of research that shows 
that value added capital employed, value added human capital, and good corporate governance affect profitability so 
that it can be considered by potential investors in decision making.

Abstract 
This study aims to identify the application of quality control in brick production. Quality is the factors contained 
in an item or result that causes the goods or results in accordance with the intended use of an item. This study uses 
a System Literature Review (SLR) approach which is used to identify and refer to the research methodology with 
certain relevant questions. Based on the research that has been done with this method it allows researchers to 
provide actual evidence regarding the data sources and criteria in selecting problem analysis. The research 
conducted is to examine the traditional brick making process and its sales strategy. Brick is the basic building 
material made of clay that is ground, then molded and dried and then baked. This production is used for efforts to 
improve the quality of brick products for small-scale industries. To improve the quality of brick products, 
manufacturers still use traditional sales strategies, one of which is offering bricks to projects that are being worked 
on. In addition to brick production, it is a flexible business. Besides that, the process of burning bricks can also 
cause air pollution which makes it suffocating for those who inhale the smoke. Thus, it can be concluded that 
effective Quality Control will be able to produce a broad market, higher productivity and lower overall production 
costs, so that companies can benefit from using an effective strategy.

Bricks, Quality control, Traditional strategy and Systematic Literature Review. 
1. Introduction
Quality control in every production is very important, one of which is the production of bricks, and every aspect 
of operation and production management, especially in industrial conditions (WG Miller, JH Nichols  2020). 
Without the right level of control we cannot achieve the right level of product quality and therefore we cannot 
achieve the right level of meeting customer demands. In the Indus tri. All organizational processes are digitized 
and controllable (Gajdzik and Wolniak  2021; He et al.  2021; Kadir and Broberg, 2021; Saniuk et al.  2020, 
Ingaldi and Ulewicz 2020). 
Production controls and methods vary between companies and specific factories as not all organizations currently 
have an adequate level of digitization. The degree of digitization has an important impact on the methods used to 
control the production process. In some situations, effective production is worse (Wilson  201 9, Jonek-Kowalska 
2019). Construction, like every industry, produces unwanted environmental impacts, being one of the most 
unsustainable industrial sectors for several reasons, such as high energy consumption (Geng et al., 2019), 
indiscriminate use of non-renewable resources that contribute to product scarcity), and the emission of activities 
that pollute the environment (Sandanayake et al.  201 9). 
Production of building materials is often the cause of high consumption of resources and energy (Murmu and 
Patel  2019). The effect can emit greenhouse gases that cause global warming (Huang et al.  2019), and, at the end 
of their life, waste bricks disposed of in landfills, contaminating the soil (Erduran et al.  2019). Throughout the 
life cycle of alternative bricks, some differences are found when compared to traditional bricks in the extraction

Figure 5. Molding is the molding stage of the brick dough. Drying, after the wet bricks are printed, enter the 
drying stage. 
 
Compressive strength and water absorption are important properties of baked clay bricks. The compressive 
strength and water absorption are affected by the method of manufacture and the process of burning the bricks. in 
brick production there are negative sides, namely air pollution caused by burning bricks, human health injuries 
caused by pollution of brick factories (Bhat et al. 2021;  Raza and Ali  2021;  Asif et al. 2021). Air pollution 
results in poor air quality which in turn has an impact on human health (Tolulope et al, 2021;  Khan et al. 2019;  
Saha et al. 2021). 
 
5.2 Bricks sales quality stategy 
Marketing strategy is a means to communicate company goals with the direction to be taken to achieve goals to 
stakeholders or parties who have decisions within the company. Today, clay brick is one of the most popular and 
preferred construction materials in many parts of the world due to its high tensile strength, durability, thermal and 
sound insulation, fire and weather resistance. But besides that, the process of burning bricks can also cause air 
pollution (Xie et al.  2021;  Miller et al. 2020). 
 
Strategy is an effort to direct the company so that the company's mission is realized. Business development is an 
effort in the process of preparing for business growth opportunities. The business development strategy in an 
Islamic perspective emphasizes more on Islamic business principles, namely customer oriented, transparency, 
healthy competition and fairness. The company's internal and external environment which includes natural 
resources, human resources, capital, marketing and technology (Haslindah et al. 2021. These strategies include 
increasing capital and lending for industrial entrepreneurs, expanding the brick marketing network by promoting 
it through social media and print media (Karnadi;  2016). As a support for the development of the brick industry, 
increasing the capacity and quality of human resources by conducting more training and providing training for 
the available workforce, socializing and registering owners of the unregistered brick industry so that their legality 
is guaranteed as well as getting legal protection and increasing cooperation. with third parties and stakeholders to 
help with limited capital and finances (Carrero et al. 2021;  Zhu et al., 2020;  Mehra et al. 2018). 
 
In direct channels, manufacturers sell products to end customers directly through online ordering systems or the 
internet; then, the producer determines the level of product quality, the level of quality prevention efforts, and the 
direct selling price (Danso et al. 2021, Wolniak  et al 2019). Prices in the direct channel, with final customer 
product demand and price elasticity decreasing, the quality level of manufacturer's products and direct sales prices 
will increase, and the level of quality prevention efforts will also increase  (Haniegal and Mohamed, 2020, Zhu et 
al.  2020). In the retail channel, the manufacturer sells the product to other retailers, who will define a strategy for 
checking product quality and then selling the product to the final customer (Farajnia  et al. 2021). Manufacturers 
determine the level of product quality, the level of quality prevention efforts, and the overall price of sales, and 
retailers determine the level of quality inspection and retail prices in there retail channels, with final customer 
product demand and price elasticity decreasing, manufacturers' product quality levels and wholesale sales prices 
will increase. , and retail prices of retail products will also increase (Shooshtarian et al. 2020, Diaz et al.   2019). 
Compared to the direct channel scenario, the level of product quality and retail prices will be much higher (Karnadi  
2016). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The manufacture of bricks generally uses raw materials from nature, namely clay which is processed from the 
stage of collecting raw materials to the stage of burning which is then sold. However, the continuous use of raw 
materials can also result in wastage of natural resources. In addition, the impact of burning bricks can also interfere 
with human respiratory health which causes shortness of breath. Sales of bricks also need a strategy to increase 
sales profits and reduce the risk of loss. Traditional brick production strategies are generally through direct 
marketing involving producers and consumers. customers, such as promotions to large projects and to homes.

Abstract 
Although many companies have applied the social comparison theory to motivate the workers for improving their 
performance, the reason why social comparison sometimes is successful and other times not, is still not fully 
understood. Recently, we have built a structural equation model to clarify the psychological mechanism that the 
workers’ personality traits, mediated by their social comparison orientations, affect their response to the downward 
social comparison, and consequently have a significant influence on the workers’ motivation and performance. In this 
paper, we extend our previous research and conduct a clustering analysis of the workers based on the factor scores of 
personality traits, social comparison orientations, motivation and efficiency. This paper places our emphasis on 
offering more detailed insight into the workers’ proportion that how many workers respond positively or negatively 
to the downward social comparison, and providing some key points for practitioners to enhance the effect of downward 
social comparison.

1. Introduction
The productivity of a company plays a key role in its profitability and competitiveness. In a variety of manufacturing 
enterprises, using automated processes within the manufacturing processes can improve their productivity levels and 
products quality, as well as profits. However, there are still many tasks such as manual assembly that need to be 
processed by hand, it is as important as ever to improve workers performance. Meanwhile, there are a great number 
of useful methodologies for achieving increased productivity, such as industrial engineering, the Kaizen method or 
philosophy. Motivation is also a powerful energy that drives and excites workers, which results in their maximum 
performance. 
In order to improve workers’ performance, some factories have applied social comparison theory to prompt workers 
to compete against each other so as to raise workers’ motivation towards assembly tasks. As there is a lack of 
researches on the effect of social comparison on workers’ performance for assembly tasks, we have designed a 
laboratory experiment of cell production to investigate the effect of social comparison (Dong and Kakehi 2018) and 
clarified that the workers’ performance could be significantly increased by averagely 20% via announcing the

(2) Cluster B: The workers of cluster A have negative scores on the opinion-based comparison orientation, and 
positive scores on the ability-based comparison orientation. While they have a stronger tendency to engage in 
ability-based comparison, but have a comparatively weaker tendency to compare opinion with others. According 
the effect of CO (comparison of opinion) and CA (comparison of ability) on motivation and efficiency, the 
downward comparison had most strongly negative influence on the motivation of this cluster’s workers. That is, 
the downward comparison decreased significantly the efficiency of cluster B’s workers. Noting that the workers 
of cluster B do not score very high or very low on the three personality traits: emotionality, extraversion and 
playfulness, they are just inconspicuous or average people. 
(3) Cluster C: This cluster’s workers score the lowest on CO (comparison of opinion) and CA (comparison of ability) 
among the four clusters. This means that these workers have a very weak tendency to engage in social 
comparison. Because they have little response to social comparison, the downward comparison has almost no 
effect on these workers. The workers of cluster C can be identified according that they have comparatively lower 
scores on all of the three personality traits: emotionality, extraversion and playfulness. 
(4) Cluster D: Although the workers of cluster D have positive scores on the opinion-based comparison orientation 
and this contributes to increase efficiency, they have the highest and positive scores on the ability-based 
comparison orientation, and this gives a very strong negative effect on efficiency. The positive effect of the 
opinion-based comparison orientation and the negative effect of the ability-based comparison orientation cancel 
each other out, as a whole these workers were not strongly motivated and therefore their efficiency is at the 
average level. This result suggest that it is necessary to improve the procedure of the downward comparison to 
decrease the negative effect of the ability-based comparison orientation. It’s easy to identify the workers of 
cluster D according to the fact that they have the strongest scores on emotionality. 
 
7. Conclusion 
According to the results of section 6, we can give the following evidences on how the workers respond the downward 
social comparison.  
(1) Thirty-one (39.2%) workers of 79 (cluster A) responded significantly and positively to the downward 
comparison.  These workers have the highest scores on both extraversion and playfulness.  
(2) There were 22 (27.8%) workers of 79 (cluster B) who are negatively motivated through the downward 
comparison, and their efficiency was decreased significantly.  These workers don’t have very high or very low 
score on the three personality traits (emotionality, extraversion and playfulness). 
(3) Fifteen (19.0%) workers of 79 (cluster C) have a very weak tendency to engage in social comparison. These 
workers almost mode no response to the downward comparison. These workers are characterized by low scores 
on all of the three personality traits: emotionality, extraversion and playfulness. 
(4) The downward comparison has both positive and negative effect on the efficiency for a small number (14.0%) 
of the workers (11 out of 79 workers, cluster D). They have the highest scores on emotionality. 
 
From these evidences, we can provide the following key points for practitioners to conduct social comparisons more 
effectively 
(1) The downward comparison described in section 3.1 is suitable to motivate the workers who have the higher 
scores on both extraversion and playfulness.  
(2) There are 27.8% of the workers who respond negatively to the downward comparison. Therefore, the downward 
comparison described in section 3.1 is not appropriate to motivate these workers. However, these workers have 
average scores on the three personality traits (emotionality, extraversion and playfulness), it may be not easy to 
identify them.

(3) There are 19.0% of the workers who barely respond to the downward comparison. These workers can be easily 
identified through the fact that they have comparatively lower scores on all of the three personality traits: 
emotionality, extraversion and playfulness. 
(4) A small number (14.0%) of the workers with the strongest emotionality respond contradictorily to the downward 
comparison. The procedure of the downward comparison should be improved to decrease the negative influence 
of the ability-based comparison orientation. For example, we can announce the assembly times and the ranks for 
the half of the workers with longer assembly times, while not announcing the workers’ name. 
 
Because the above results were obtained based on the small sample size (n=79), the workers’ proportion in the four 
clusters may change if the sample size is increased. It is necessary to increase sample size to confirm the above results. 
Moreover, we are going to improve the procedure of the downward comparison and conduct some new experiments.

Abstract 
For the agricultural tractors, the risk of loss of stability is limited when passive safety devices, the so-called 
rollover protective structures (ROPSs), are installed. In the case of limited height coltures, such as vineyards or 
orchards, the tractor is often equipped with a two-posts foldable and front-monuted roll-bar ROPS (FRB). The 
main advantage of FRBs consists in the possibility to use the tractor with a low operative overall height, keeping 
the rollbar folded down. However, FRB’s conventional solutions underestimate the operators’ risk-taking 
behavior and their widespread misuse due to the efforts needed to operate them. This study aims at reducing the 
problem by providing the FRB with aided systems to facilitate the FRB raising and locking. In particular, the 
ergonomics issues related to the raising and lowering phase were investigated and the technical characteristics of 
aided systems were detected. This led to the development of a novel automatic system to lock the FRB in a safety 
configuration to support the tractor’s operator.

1. Introduction
The most relevant risk related to the use of agricultural tractors consists in the tractor roll-over (Vita et al. 2021). 
Focusing on the Italian situation, as shown in Figure 1, the average value of fatalities due to in-field roll-over in 
the period 2010–2018 is 74.7% (Figure 1). Similar situations can be found in other countries (Pinzke et al. 2018; 
Myers et al. 2010). 
Additionally, it has to be considered that most fatalities occurred when the roll-over protective structure (ROPS) 
was not installed, or when it was disabled, as in the case of foldable front-mounted roll-bar ROPS (FRBs). The 
frequency of these cases is very large as demonstrated by the extant literature, which has shown that from 30% to 
50% of fatalities are related to incorrect use of foldable protective structures (Silleli et al. 2007; Ballesteros et al. 
2013). Numerous initiatives have been promoted to tackle this diffused problem: for instance, in different 
countries were organized retrofitting campaigns, i.e. fostering the installation of ROPSs by means of incentives 
and/or technical guidelines provided by public authorities. However, retrofitting campaigns do not solve the 
problem of the FRB’s misuse during cultivation activities characterized by a low clearance between the tractor 
and the vegetation. Actually, to operate in these environments farmers usually unfold the ROPS and they keep it 
unfolded even when the operations in narrow spaces are completed. This unsafe attitude is very diffused and it is 
usually motivated by the excessive effort needed to fold/unfold the rollbar (Micheletti Cremasco et al. 2020).  
To reduce such a phenomenon, several innovative solutions have been proposed in the literature: for instance, an 
automatically deployable anchor mechanism to prevent continuous rolling during sideways roll-over was 
presented by Silleli et al. (2008). Another solution is represented by the automatically deployable front-mounted 
ROPS presented by Ballesteros et al. (2015) that can be deployed both in height and width, and locked in its 
operative position. Other studies have analysed the problem from the ergonomics point of view, mainly focusing 
on the efforts needed to operate the rollbar (Facchinetti et al. 2021; Micheletti Cremasco et al. 2021). These studies

activities. Accordingly, further research is expected to augment the proposed methodology by means of additional 
practical applications. 
Lastly, the study shows the important relationship between ergonomics and safety improvement, highlighting the 
fundamental role of human factors as a key factor in carrying out work activities safely.

Abstract 
Technology is something that is very influential in various fields of human life today, one of which is in the field of 
education. As is well known, the use of technology in the field of education today certainly has a very significant 
impact on the progress of education in Indonesia. However, in this pandemic era, face-to-face learning activities are 
becoming very limited so various online learning platforms must be involved as a solution. The higher the number of 
learning platforms used tends to be less effective and makes students or even teachers more confused. Therefore, an 
online learning application is designed that is equipped with various features to facilitate the online learning process 
and minimize the use of many different platforms so that the learning process becomes more effective.

Abstract 
The marketplace is one of the trade sectors that is growing and developing quickly. In a large company, Human 
Resources (HR) has a role as an important asset for achieving corporate goals. The phenomenon that occurs at XYZ 
company in the payroll system is subjective and inconsistent with performance and achievement. That is considered 
unfair by the employees It has an impact on their discipline violations and decreases the effectiveness of the 
performance and many company goals are not performing well. Reporting and performance evaluation have been 
carried out but an unstructured performance evaluation system results in a lack of motivation and rewards for 
employees. Based on the phenomena, this research aims to design performance appraisal based on Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI) in company XYZ. This study uses a qualitative method based on descriptive objectives and an 
inductive approach. Sources of research data through interviews and observations from primary and secondary data 
sources. The stages in this study are the pre-court phase, fieldwork, and data analysis. Data is processed through 
editing, coding, entry/processing, and cleaning. Test the validity of data using triangulation techniques. Data validity 
test using triangulation techniques. Data analysis techniques use data reduction, data presentation, and conclusions. 
Research results are 16 formats of performance appraisal related to the vision and mission of the company and the job 
analysis of each division along with the weighting of each performance indicator.

1. Introduction
Economic activities that have started to be carried out based on applications and websites control almost all sectors in 
the world. Of these many sectors, the trade sector is the leading sector that currently controls almost all markets in 
Indonesia based on digital technology which we know as e-commerce (Putri and Zakaria 2020). One of the trade 
sectors in Indonesia is the marketplace company PT XYZ. According to the data site, PT XYZ has more than 6,000 
active users and 1,100 sellers. The bigger the company, the company's Human Resources (HR) has a role as the most 
important asset to be able to realize the company's goals. The success of an organization, both large and small, is not 
solely determined by the available natural resources but is largely determined by the quality of human resources (HR) 
who plan, implement and control the organization concerned. So that it takes good management of Human Resources 
(HR) to get the role of HR and it can be said that it’s not easy (Bukit et al. 2017).

Based on Table 17 shows the  indicators of non technical performance appraisal from problem/phenomena is regarding 
the violation of attendance obligations and attitude. That an assessment indicator is needed so that there are no more 
employees who violate and the assessment becomes more objective. These non-technical performance indicators apply 
to all employees of PT XYZ. Concluded into 2 non-technical performance indicators are attitude and discipline. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A this study discusses the needs of PT XYZ employees for the establishment of performance appraisals. The author 
then made observations regarding the needs of these employees and obtained several supporting phenomena and 
supporting journals related to the problems faced. The first phenomenon comes from the results of discussions with 
the human resources management (HRM) team of PT XYZ which is supported by the results of interviews with 16 
sources. the company does not have a performance appraisal has an impact on the payroll system which is considered

subjective, giving salaries that are not in accordance with the performance and achievements of employees and are 
considered unfair by employees. The next phenomenon is that there are violations that continue to increase every 
month against the obligation to be absent. The third phenomenon arises because of the resulting impact between work 
discipline and performance appraisal on the work effectiveness of employees in a company or organization. In the 
absence of discipline and performance appraisal in the company, the effectiveness of employee performance will 
decrease and the company's goals cannot be implemented properly. This happened at PT XYZ where the effectiveness 
of the marketing division employees decreased and could not be implemented properly. The author makes a 
performance appraisal format for the 16 divisions at PT XYZ. The decline from the company's vision and mission, 
then an analysis of the positions of each division which then becomes the KPI and becomes a performance assessment 
for each division in accordance with the targets and weights set directly by the company.

Abstract 
Forward and inverse kinematic studies are essential in the design of robotic arms. The paper investigates 
kinematics of a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom developed on Arduino Mega platform. The forward 
kinematics allows the establishment of the spatial coordinates and orientation of the end-effector for a 
given joints set of variables using the Denavit-Hartenberg Representation. The simulation of the 3D CAD 
model is performed in RVC Matlab Toolbox. The inverse kinematics allows the determination of all joints 
variables of the robot for a given end-effector position and orientation and is performed analytically.

Abstract 
In this era, the usage of game-based language learning is common. This is caused by the habits of students who are curious 
about the existence of games in their daily lives. This study outlines the procedures and methodology for designing and 
developing 2D game platforms for Indonesian language instruction. The problem-defining, genre-designing, theme-designing, 
gameplay-designing, and game-functionality-testing phases of this game's development. During the early stages of 
development of a 2D platformer game for Indonesian language study, positive findings were obtained.

1. Introduction
In order to adapt to the digital environment, instructors must be creative. One way to accomplish this is through the gamification 
of learning. It is expected that gamification will motivate students to study. Point accumulation is an important aspect of the 
game. The accumulation of these points will impact their motivation and commitment. However, gamification must take 
learning objectives into account. In order to provide successful learning outcomes, a smart gamification design focuses on the 
needs and characteristics of the user (Dinata 2021). 
University students are required to take an Indonesian course. To yet, however, there has been no game-based support for 
learning Indonesian MKUD. This work aims to develop a prototype for gamification of MKUD in Indonesian universities. This 
will inspire students to study Indonesian. In order to boost student engagement in learning and make it more pleasurable without 
their understanding, the most important part of gamification is having the correct concept and clear objectives (Heni 2016). 
Additionally, students can assess their language skills. 
Indonesian is considered a challenging topic. Students struggle with linguistic competence, subcompetence structure (61.07%), 
and vocabulary (52.6%); listening competence (41.88%), speaking (18.89%), reading (21.15%), and writing (20.02%); and 
good literature at the level of information (45.69%), concept (40.9%), perspective (41.74%), and appreciation (47.1%) (Basuki, 
Suryani, and Setiadi 2017). Researchers predict that by the use of gamification, students would be able to overcome problems 
in learning Indonesian. Especially with the use of spelling, which takes a better comprehension. 
At least three elements must be considered when applying gamification: (1) student learning demands, (2) alignment with 
learning objectives, and (3) teacher creativity in designing it.  
First, a student's educational requirements. Based on the initial needs analysis, the Basic Indonesian General Course does not 
feature gaming. In fact, gamification is equally necessary for students learning a foreign language. Second, the content provided 
through gamification must correspond with the learning objectives. The purpose of learning objectives is to help students realize 
their full educational potential. The learning objectives will be useless if the gamification is ineffective; hence, the construction

game was working well. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Positive results were obtained during the initial phase of creation of a 2D platformer game for learning Indonesian language. 
Through a number of phases, including Problem Definition, Game Genre, Theme Design, Gameplay Design, and Game 
Functional Testing. It is hoped that this game will one day make a positive contribution to the world of education and Indonesian 
language learning. The improvement and completion of games, the usefulness of utilizing games in learning, and the 
perspectives of teachers and students towards the use of games for accomplishing learning objectives can be the focus of future 
research.

Abstract 
Currently, competition between companies is getting more challenging, so companies need better morale and 
corporate image to survive. A good reputation can be realized when the company carries out social responsibility. 
This study examines the determinants of corporate social responsibility disclosure, namely gender diversity, frequency 
of board of commissioners' meetings, and foreign ownership. Based on the sample selection criteria, this study 
obtained 80 observational data on manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2018 to 
2020. The results showed that the frequency of board of commissioners' meetings and foreign ownership positively 
affect corporate social responsibility disclosure. In contrast, gender diversity did not affect corporate social 
responsibility disclosure. In achieving good corporate governance, the company is expected to hold the more frequent 
board of commissioners' meetings to discuss the company's strategy, evaluate risk control policies, and solve problems 
more quickly and precisely, especially those related to the environment and society. Foreign ownership can encourage 
companies to be more concerned about corporate social responsibility disclosure.

1. Introduction
In 2020, the Manufacturing Industry's and National GDP experienced a drastic decline compared to the previous year. 
This decline was caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that entered Indonesia. As a result of the pandemic, the Indonesian 
economy and even the world experienced a drastic decline. All sectors have been affected by the pandemic, but the 
manufacturing industry is one of the sectors on which the national economy relies. Despite being under heavy pressure 
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the manufacturing industry in Indonesia continues to strive to rise through the 
expansionary phase, as reflected in the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 51.3. This number has increased 
compared to the previous month, which was only 50.6 (Sulaeeman 2021). The contribution given by manufacturing 
companies to the National GDP is the largest compared to other sectors so the manufacturing industry has become the 
leading sector (Statistics Indonesia 2021). 
This research was conducted because of the following motivations. First, companies that get the title of green industry 
are still involved in environmental pollution. The Indonesian government supports companies in carrying out CSR 
practices to protect the environment from the negative impacts of company activities by issuing laws and government 
regulations. Even though the government has issued regulations, companies still violate them. One is a manufacturing 
company in the Pulp & Paper sub-sector, PT. Fajar Surya Wisesa Tbk. (FASW), which received a 2019 green industry 
award certificate. Still, in 2020 the Bekasi Regency Regional People's Representative Assembly found pollution in 
the Cikarang Barat Laut River in Kalijaya village and the Alam Cikarang river (Alamsyah 2020). This phenomenon 
indicates that there are factors that influence the disclosure of corporate social responsibility (CSR), so this study 
focuses on the effect of gender diversity, frequency of board of commissioners meetings, and foreign ownership on 
corporate social responsibility disclosure. 
Second, previous studies have examined gender diversity, frequency of board of commissioners meetings, foreign 
ownership, and CSR disclosure with inconsistent results. Nour et al. (2020) found a positive effect on CSR disclosure

Table 2 shows that gender diversity did not affect CSR disclosure, so it did not support H1. This result implies that 
the presence of women on the board of directors did not affect the level of CSR disclosure because, in Indonesia, the 
share of women on the board of directors is still relatively low. This result is consistent with Anggraeni and Djakman 
(2017) and Farida (2020). The frequency of board of commissioners (CM) meetings has a positive effect on CSR 
Disclosure so that it supports H2. This finding implies that the board of commissioners is a corporate governance 
mechanism, so they hold meetings to manage the company's activities and try to fulfill the wishes of stakeholders, one 
of which is corporate social responsibility. The board of commissioners that holding regular meetings will prevent 
mistakes in decision-making by management regarding company activities. Therefore, the higher the frequency of 
board of commissioners' meetings will result in better decisions and reduce the risk of problems. This result is 
consistent with Ayatunisa and Prastiwi (2018) and Sektiyani and Ghozali (2019). Foreign ownership (FO) positively 
affects CSR disclosure so that it supports H3. This finding implies that the presence of foreign owners can influence 
the company's decision to be more concerned with environmental and social issues. The company will be encouraged 
to disclose its information more voluntarily to accommodate a lot of interest. These results support Suprijani and 
Patrisia (2020) and Sumilat and Destriana (2017). 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study examines the effect of gender diversity, frequency of board of commissioners' meetings, and foreign 
ownership on corporate social responsibility. The test results found that the frequency of board of commissioners' 
meetings and foreign ownership positively affected corporate social responsibility. In contrast, gender diversity did 
not affect corporate social responsibility disclosure. This study concludes that the higher the foreign ownership and 
the frequency of board of commissioners’ meetings, the higher the corporate social responsibility disclosure carried 
out by the company so that it can help the company to get a good reputation from stakeholders. Companies with 
relatively low corporate social responsibility are expected to increase social and environmental awareness. The 
company is also expected to increase the proportion of women's boards to manage and advance the company jointly.  
 
This study can only prove that the frequency of board of commissioners' meetings and foreign ownership positively 
affects CSR disclosure. The gender diversity of the board of directors does not affect the level of CSR disclosure. 
Future researchers can make some improvements. First, further research can use different objects, namely non-
manufacturing companies or banking companies. Second, the next researcher can use other indicators of gender 
diversity, such as the gender diversity of the board of commissioners or the gender diversity of the board of directors 
and the board of commissioners. Third, future research may use different CSR disclosure criteria, such as the Global 
Reporting Initiative.

Abstract 
During manufacturing, quality must be maintained, it has always been considered a very important success factor 
for companies. Producing high quality products while maintaining minimal costs is the mandate of all 
manufacturing companies. Therefore our study is based on the study of quality defects of Half Shaft part. A 
Moroccan automobile manufacturer of mechanical transmission parts is considered as a testing ground, the case 
study is oriented towards the study of induction hardening process of the Half Shaft part. In order to meet customer 
requirements in terms of part hardness specifications, a heat treatment is applied which subsequently generates 
depth hardness defects. A classification method based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied in 
order to classify these defects according to specified criteria chosen by experts. It is a decision-making method in 
the case where there are several criteria. The defects generated in the induction haredening process are depth 
hardness defects which differ according to the section of the part. In this context, four depth hardness defects will 
be considered, and three criteria will be chosen in order to applicate the AHP method. The classification of these 
defects helps to select the crucial defect to eradicate it and subsequently obtain better quality parts.  
Key Words :

Introduction 
Today the Moroccan automotive sector is in continuous progression, automotive manufacturers are under severe 
competitive pressure due to increased global competition and customer demands. In order to meet this challenge, 
quality must be maintained. It has been recognized for many years as a key success factor for companies in order 
to improve their productivity and not lose their competitiveness. Indeed, quality has a fundamental role in 
production processes, as it guarantees the reliability of products/services according to customer requirements. It 
is on this basis that our research is directed towards the study of the defects generated during the heat treatment 
which impacts the quality of the product. 
In this article, we will focus on the classification of defects while applying a classification method based on the 
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Our case study is oriented towards the study of injection hardening process 
of mechanical transmission parts (Half Shaft) for a Moroccan automotive industry. 
In this context, we considered four defects of depth hardness of the Half Shaft part which differ according to the 
section of the part, we will classify them according to three criteria.

Results and Discussion 
After applying the AHP method of classification the primary defect is A with a score of 80% followed by 
defect C with a score of 53% then defect B with a severity of 29% and finally defect F with a low importance of 
6.6%. 
Thus, an analysis of the range of defect scores shows a very wide range of 73.4% since the maximum score is 
80% while the minimum score is 6.6%. This allows us to subsequently give great importance to the relevant defect 
in the problem-solving phase without wasting time in resolving less important defects. 
Conclusion 
In this article, a hardness defect classification method was applied, the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) 
method; this method mainly comprises five steps: (1) identification of the criteria, (2) determination of the 
comparison matrix, (3) calculation of the AHP weights of the different criteria, (4) verification of the 
consistency of our approach, (5) calculation a weighted score of each defect in order to rank them. 
A hardness defect classification case study has been provided to illustrate the method and test its effectiveness. 
The results show that the proposed method helps to make effective classification decisions when there is more 
than one criterion. 
As future research we will base on the problem solving phase, that generates the critical hardness defect in order 
to have a good quality product and satisfy the customer.

Abstract 
The CCovid-19 pandemic makes a huge impact on every business sector all around the world, including the culinary 
business in Indonesia. As a primary sector, before the outbreak happened, the culinary business competition was very 
tight. Therefore, it becomes more difficult for the culinary business actors to survive and sustain their businesses due 
to the pandemic. A bbrownies shop in Tegal City, Indonesia launched several product innovations as a response to 
this condition. However, some of them were not successful. On the other hand, its sales from 2020 to 2021 were 
growing. Hence, this study is conducted to examine the impact of product innovation on the purchase decision in this 
shop. The most influential dimension of product innovation to the purchase decision is also discovered. To gather the 
data, questionnaires are distributed to 342 customers by using the purposive sampling method. After conducting a 
validity, reliability, and classic assumption test, descriptive analysis, and a simple linear regression test are utilized to 
analyze the data. At the end of the data analysis step, the hypothesis test is conducted by using the t-test and followed 
by the coefficient of determination test. It is found that product innovation has a positive and significant effect on the 
purchase decisions of the brownies shop consumers with a value of 79.5 percent. Further study is expected to conduct 
a factor analysis to find out other variables besides product innovation that can influence the purchase decision.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a country that has a wealth of creative economic potential with the culinary sub-sector providing the 
largest contribution by contributing around 41 percent of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the creative 
economy of IDR 1,134 trillion in 2020 (Agmasari 2021). One of the provinces in Indonesia that has some advantages 
in the culinary sub-sector is Central Java. It is shown by the creative economy businesses in Central Java which is 
dominated by the culinary sub-sector reaching 69.8 percent with a total of 1,410,155 businesses and 3,146,702 workers 
(Fakhruddin 2021). Of the many areas in Central Java, Tegal City is one area that is developing its culinary potential. 
In 2017, the Mayor of Tegal inaugurated Tegal City as a Culinary City (Warta Bahari  2017). Statistics office of  Tegal 
City (2021) stated that the City of Tegal has 89 restaurants and 1,104 food stalls with a population of 273,830 residents. 
Therefore, this condition creates a high competition for culinary business actors in various ways to survive as well as 
to gather the consumers. One of the efforts to increase the company's competitiveness is to implement innovation. 
Innovation is an effort to improve new products, processes, materials, and services that are developed and transferred 
to appropriate industries and or markets (Dhewanto et al. 2014). The culinary business that was observed to be 
innovating was Miemie Brownie, Tegal, Central Java. Miemie Brownie has also enlivened the City of Tegal as a 
culinary city by creating modern and exclusive souvenirs. Miemie Brownie is one of the culinary businesses in Tegal 
City which is quite developed where in 2016 initially only accepted online orders until now Miemie Brownie has had 
two branches. Sales turnover in 2020-2021 tends to increase every month though it has decreased due to the increasing 
cases of the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Based on the results of data processing that can be seen in table 6, the result of hypothesis testing is obtained with a 
tcount of 36,299 with a significance of 0.000, then compared with the ttable with a probability of 5 percent and df = 342-
2 = 340. Then the results obtained ttable is 1,967. Because the results of tcount > t table (36,299 > 1,976) and significance 
(0.000 < 0.05) then H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted. It can be stated that Product Innovation has a significant effect 
on the Purchase Decision of Miemie Brownie consumers. 
 
Based on the results of data processing, it can also be seen that the coefficient of determination is 79.5 percent. This 
indicates that the influence of product innovation on purchase decisions is 79.5 percent, while the remaining 20.5 
percent is contributed by other variables outside this research. 
 
Based on the results of the data analysis that has been carried out, it can be seen that the results of this study are 
relatively the same and support previous research that has been carried out by Zhang & Tang (2017), Almira & Sutanto 
(2018), Lahindah et al. (2018), Ghozali et al. (2019), Osman et al. (2020), Wulandari (2021), and Rayi & Aras (2021), 
where Product Innovation has a positive and significant effect on the purchase decision. Meanwhile, this research also 
contradicts the previous research conducted by Hatta et al. (2018) and Ernawati (2019) which state that Product 
Innovation does not affect the purchase decision. 
 
5. Conclusion and Suggestions 
Based on the results of the data analysis, these are the conclusions of this study: 
a. 
The Product Innovation implemented by Miemie Brownie is in a good category. 
b. The Purchase Decision carried out by Miemie Brownie is included in the good category. 
c. 
Product Innovation has a positive and significant effect on the Purchase Decision of Miemie Brownie 
consumers with a value of 79.5 percent. 
 
This study also offers some suggestions as follows:  
a. 
Miemie Brownie needs to maintain its product innovation because it is proven that product innovation has a 
huge effect on consumers’ purchase decisions for Miemie Brownie. 
b. Further research is suggested to do a factor analysis to find out other variables besides product innovation 
that can influence the purchase decision of Miemie Brownie consumers to find out the 20.5 percent of other 
factors that influence the purchase decision.

Nature of Industry and Financial Stability  
as Indications of Fraudulent Financial Statements

Abstract 
In this globalization era, the risk of fraudulent financial statements is increasing. Fraudulent financial statements were 
due to opportunities, pressures, and political relations from several ranks of the board of directors and commissioners. 
Countries often experience economic instability, so companies must maintain financial performance to remain in good 
condition. Economic instability and less than optimal supervision trigger companies to commit fraudulent actions in 
financial statements, like manipulation of financial statements, misappropriation of assets, or other matters that are 
not under applicable accounting standards. This study aims to examine the effect of the nature of industry, financial 
stability, and political connection on fraudulent financial statements. This study uses 58 manufacturing companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2018 to 2020. Fraudulent financial statements are measured using the 
fraud score model. This study finds that the nature of industry negatively affects fraudulent financial statements. 
Companies with a high ratio of changes in receivables need to be supported by strong supervision so that management 
does not have the opportunity to manipulate financial statements. This study also found that financial stability 
positively affects fraudulent financial statements. When a company experiences growth below the industry average, 
management manipulates financial statements to improve the company's prospects. However, this study did not find 
any influence of political connections on fraudulent financial statements.

1. Introduction
The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (2018) revealed that the most fraud cases in the Asia Pacific occurred 
in the manufacturing industry from 2017-2018, namely 38 cases with a loss of $500,000. In 2019-2020 cases of fraud 
in the manufacturing industry fell to 26 cases with a loss of $400,000, where this fraud is the most fraudulent compared 
to any other industry (Association of Certified Fraud Examiners 2020). According to the Association of Certified 
Fraud Examiners (2020), fraud has three main factors: the misappropriation of assets, manipulation of financial 
statements, and corruption. Data shows that cases of misappropriation of assets as much as 89% caused the lowest 
loss of $114,000, corruption cases were 38%, with an average loss of $250,000, and cases of manipulation of financial 
statements by 10% with an average loss of $800,000. The data shows that financial statement manipulation has the 
lowest percentage of cases but has the highest loss rate compared to the other two fraud factors. 
One of the financial statement fraud cases occurred in a manufacturing company in Indonesia, namely PT. Tiga Pilar 
Sejahtera Food Tbk. (AISA). The company overstates receivables amounting to Rp1.4 trillion, and the alleged flow 
of funds from the company to management amounted to Rp1.78 trillion. The fraud causes losses for investors. The 
fraud is also contrary to the quality of faithful presentation as regulated in the Indonesian Financial Accounting 
Standard 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (Institute of Indonesian Chartered Accountants 2019). This fraud 
case motivated this research. 
Previous studies have investigated the nature of the industry, financial stability, political connection, and fraudulent 
financial statements with the inconsistent result. Novitasari and Chariri (2018) found that the nature of industry had a 
positive effect on fraudulent financial statements, while Setiawati and Baningrum (2018) did not find any effect of the 
nature of industry on fraudulent financial statements. Novitasari and Chariri (2018) found that financial stability 
positively affected fraudulent financial statements, while Setiawati and Baningrum (2018) did not find any effect of 
financial stability on fraudulent financial statements. Matangkin et al. (2018) found that political connection had a

Table 2 shows that nature of industry (NI) proxied by receivables is 0.0000 < 0.05 with a negative regression 
coefficient of -3.1353. These results indicate that the nature of the industry negatively affects fraudulent financial 
statements, thus indicating that H1 is rejected. This finding suggests that the high changes in receivables are also 
accompanied by solid supervision to minimize the opportunity for management to commit fraud in the financial 
statements. This result is consistent with Nabila (2020) finding. Financial stability (FS) is proxied by achange of 
0.0344 < 0.05 with a positive regression coefficient of 0.2445. These results indicate that financial stability positively 
affects fraudulent financial statements, which means that H2 is accepted. 
 This finding is in line with our expectation which shows the higher the financial stability, the higher the change in 
the company's total assets from year to year. This condition happens because the company's finances are unstable, 
putting pressure on managers to abuse company assets. This result is consistent with Novitasari and Chariri (2018). 
Political connection (PC) has a probability of 0.1252 > 0.05 with a negative regression coefficient of -0.1275. These 
results indicate that political connection did not affect fraudulent financial statements, which suggests that H3 is 
rejected. This result is not in line with our expectations because the existence of a political connection in a company 
does not indicate that a company commits fraud in its financial statements. The greater political connection in this 
study only shows as an effort to support the company's business, not because of differences in interests between agents 
and principals or to provide opportunities for fraud. This finding follows Rosida and Setyawan (2021). 
6. Conclusion
This study investigates the effect of the nature of the industry, financial stability, and political connection on fraudulent 
financial statements. This study found that the nature of the industry has a negative effect, whereas financial stability 
has a positive effect on fraudulent financial statements. Different results found that political connection does not affect 
fraudulent financial statements. The company's management is expected to carry out more substantial supervision and 
internal control to prevent fraud in the financial statements. The company is expected to be more intensive in 
socializing anti-fraud activities to minimize the risk of fraudulent financial statements. This study did not find any 
influence of political connections on fraudulent financial statements. The next researcher can investigate political 
connections by measuring political relations only for directors or commissioners. Further researchers can also measure 
political connections with other indicators, such as the presence of shareholders who control at least 10% of the total 
shares with voting rights and have ties to politicians or political parties.

The Effects of Ambiguity on Evaluations of Multiple 
Prospects

Abstract 
This paper examines whether individuals perceive benefits from diversification when prospects are ambiguous and 
how those benefits compare to analogous situations under risk. Based on Gilboa and Schmeidler’s (1989) maxmin 
expected utility model, the hypothesis is that only risk-seeking individuals would receive non-zero diversification 
benefits. In particular, these decision-makers would receive negative benefits from diversification that would increase 
in the gains domain and further decrease in the losses domain as the degree of ambiguity increases. Results from a 
series of experiments suggest that people may perceive less benefit from diversification under ambiguity than under 
risk. However, individuals tend to diversify over a greater number of prospects when the prospects are ambiguous 
than when they are risky. This may be due to people’s attempt to compensate for the lower marginal benefit of 
diversifying under ambiguity than under risk. It also implies a decrease in tolerance toward aleatory uncertainty in 
presence of epistemic uncertainty.

1. Introduction
We often have to make decisions in life that involve taking on several uncertain prospects simultaneously. For 
example, people often apply to many job openings, they may also buy bundles of different products, or most 
straightforwardly, they generally invest in several financial assets. In these situations, we normally do not know the 
exact probability distribution for all possible outcomes. Thus, we are essentially making decisions that involve 
multiple ‘ambiguous’ prospects. 
Since the seminal paper by Ellsberg (1961), researchers have become well-aware that people can have distastes for 
unknown probability distributions. In particular, individuals will generally choose prospects with known probability 
distributions of outcomes over comparable ones with imprecisely known distributions. This behavioral phenomenon 
has become known as aversion to ambiguity. The distinction between known risk and unknown uncertainty or 
ambiguity was postulated by Knight (1921) and recently elaborated on with organizational perspectives by Kleindorfer 
(2010). There has been substantial work, both theoretical and empirical, on this topic of decision-making under 
ambiguity (see Camerer and Weber 1992, Nau 2007, and Epstein and Schneider 2010 for related reviews). 
In regard to decisions concerning multiple prospects, there are two streams of relevant literature. First, there have been 
some studies in the marketing field that have studied choice and valuations of product bundles (Gaeth et al. 1991, 
Yadav 1994, Leszczyc et al. 2008). However, uncertainties in these investigations are with respect to values or 
outcomes rather than probabilities. The field of research that has examined decisions involving multiple ambiguous 
prospects most extensively is finance specifically, regarding portfolio choice and asset pricing. However, most of the 
experimental papers in this area have focused on comparative demands between risky and ambiguous assets (Ahn et 
al. 2009, Bossaerts et al. 2010). 
In this paper, weintended to consider the scenario in which two or more prospects are equally ambiguous. The goal is 
to investigate the effect of ambiguity on individuals’ valuations and selections of multiple prospects in a bundle. More 
specifically, weare interested in examining how the increasing degree of ignorance regarding the probability 
distributions of prospects can affect people’s preferences for these bundles.

A two-way mixed ANOVA with domain as the within-subject factor and probability precision as the between-subject 
factor revealed a marginally significant effect for domain (F1, 164 = 3.686, p = 0.057). This suggests that subjects may 
prefer a higher number of prospects in the losses domain (M = 3.45) than in the gains domain (M = 3.80) or that they 
diversify to a greater degree in losses than in gains. However, the interaction between domain and probability precision 
was not significant (F2, 164 = 1.014, p = 0.365) and neither was the between-subject effect of probability precision (F2, 
164 = 0.970, p = 0.381). These results imply that the different probability precisions had no influence on people’s 
diversification behavior regardless of the domain. Because of the slight differences in number of subjects in each 
condition, wealso ran the Gabriel post-hoc test on the probability precision. Nevertheless, the differences were not 
significant between any pair of probability precisions: risk and low-ambiguity (p = 1.000), risk and high-ambiguity (p 
= 0.572), and low-ambiguity and high-ambiguity (p = 0.524). 
 
7. Discussion and Conclusion 
Recall from Section 3, that we had expected that only people who are risk-seeking in both domains would be affected 
by diversification under ambiguity. For these individuals, we had predicted that the negative benefits from 
diversification in the gains domain would decrease, while the negative benefits from diversification in the losses 
domain would increase with increasing degree of ambiguity. We did not anticipate that risk-averse and risk-neutral 
individuals would receive any positive or negative benefits from diversification in any domains according to MEU.  
 
Results from Experiment 1 seem to contradict our predictions with regards to pricing of prospects in both the gains 
and losses domain. As the predominant attitudes were risk-averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses, we should expect 
no effects in the former and decreasing diversification benefits in the latter. However, there seems to be a general 
benefit to diversification in the gains domain that decreases with increasing degree of ambiguity (Figure 1). In addition, 
there seems to be no significant disadvantages to diversification in the losses domain at any level of ambiguity (Figure 
2). Results from Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 are particularly interesting in comparison to the findings from 
Experiment 1. In particular, even though individuals perceive less benefit from diversification under ambiguity than 
under risk in the gains domain from Experiment 1, the results in Experiments 2 and 3 imply that people may tend to 
diversify to an even greater extent under ambiguity than under risk. More specifically, the percentage of people 
preferring the double set of gambles in Experiment 2 (Figure 3) and the average number of prospects chosen in 
Experiment 3 were somewhat higher under ambiguity than under risk (Figure 5).   
 
Although it is not uncommon to observe distinct ambiguity preferences under different tasks (see Du and Budescu 
2005), the findings from the Experiments 1-3 may have plausible explanations. First, it may be more difficult for 
individuals to determine the value of diversification under ambiguity than under risk, especially when prospect 
concern potential losses. This may have lead to under-valuations of multiple ambiguous prospects in the gains domain 
and no effect of diversification in the losses domain as is found in Experiment 1. Second, if the marginal benefit from 
diversifying over an additional prospect is indeed higher under risk than under ambiguity, this may actually lead to 
individuals choosing a larger number of prospects to compensate in the latter condition. This implies that the results 
all the three experiments, at least in the gains domain, may in fact be consistent. More specifically, in presence of 
epistemic risk or the imprecisely known probability of outcomes, people may be less tolerant toward aleatory risk or 
the uncertainty of the resulting outcome. 
 
One of the strongest and most interesting results from the experiments in this paper is the fact that people tend to 
diversify over potential losses and to an even greater extent than over potential gains. This is surprising as we had 
expected from the predictions that the predominantly risk-averse individuals in the gains domain would receive no 
benefits from diversification, while the predominantly risk-seeking individuals in the losses domain would actually 
receive disbenefits from the same process. In examining reasons subjects had given for their choices in Experiment 2, 
wehave found that most subjects who chose the double gamble set over their single counterpart gave some variations 
of diversification to reduce the uncertainty as the reason in both domains. However, it appeared that many participants 
were concerned about the maximum payoff in the losses domain. Thus, their preference to diversify may be in fact be 
driven by greater influence of loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) in face of increasing ambiguity. 
 
There are many aspects that warrant further investigation on the topic of decisions that involve multiple ambiguous 
prospects. For example, it is not clear how subjects perceive the relationship between two ambiguous prospects and 
how they may hedge against ambiguity or epistemic risk in comparison to aleatory risk or the uncertain outcomes. It

may also be beneficial to investigate how people would allocate resources among various ambiguous prospects at 
different levels of ambiguity. Nevertheless, the findings in this paper proposes that rather than under-diversify, people 
may in fact diversify over a higher number of prospects in presence of ambiguity. This seems to be particularly true 
when individuals are faced with prospects that involve potential losses. Prescriptive managerial implications may 
include recommendations provided by financial advisors. In particular, when markets are relatively volatile, investors 
may actually be more attracted to allocate funds over many less-familiar financial products)

Abstract 
Sustainability plays an important role in protecting the surrounding environment from adverse impacts. It becomes a 
spotlight for researchers and engineers. The continuously developing social, economic, and environmental 
challenges need an evolution of the currentsustainable buildingdesignfactors with maintaining a direct relationship 
with the past andfuture. Based on reviewing the literature, the current factors are identified. However, there is a 
lacking in identifying future factors and exploring the interrelationship between current and future factors. This 
study identifiesthen validatesfuture factors by using the Delphi technique. Moreover, explores the interrelationship 
between factors by applying the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), in particular the interpretive structural 
modeling (ISM) and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) methods. Finding the 
interrelationship will help future engineers in making decisions. A five-level model is generated which includes 
twelve factors, linking current and future factors. This model suggests that location and transportation factor is the 
key factor in the decision-making of designing sustainable buildings. Moreover, driving and dependence powers will 
guide the engineers in concentrating on the key factor. Accordingly, the factors are allocated into dependent and 
linkage clusters. Building space optimization factor has a high dependency on other factors as it is the only factor 
appears in the dependent cluster. While most of the factors appear in the linkage cluster which are unstable in the 
system and just transferring the effect. Future research work can consider other MCDM tools in validating 
theresults.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the topic of sustainable building design has received growing attention and has become an 
increasingly popular research area. The benefits of sustainable building design go beyond the environmental and 
economic impacts, it has also positive effects on the social sector specifically on people's health (Allen et al. 2015). 
Nowadays, top engineering managers are facing challenges in implementing sustainable designs for the existing and 
newly constructed buildings by considering all the building design factors, where immense pressure is exerted for

power. No positioned factors were found in this clusterwhich means that there is no main driving factor that will 
have a major impact on the other factors in the system.

5. Conclusion and Future Work 
The goal of this research is to identify then validate theoretical framework the current and future sustainable 
building design factors. It also attempts to explore the interrelationship between the current and future factors for 
developing an effective guideline for future engineers in designing sustainable buildings by adopting a unified 
approach in the decision-making step. The findings from this research will provide a new dimension to an integrated 
approach to the problem. This study contributes significantly to the current literature by identifying the gaps in 
literature. The research methodology comprises more than one phase of the decision-making process. Starting with 
identifying the problem, reviewing the literature, applying the Delphi technique, and ending with implementing the 
MCDM by doing the ISM-MICMAC analysis. This methodology allows for flexibility in structuring the research 
problem by merging the academic and industrial fields in exploring the interrelationship between the factors. For 
future studies,they can be used in other countries to create a more general guideline, other MCDM tools can be 
applied to validate the results of this research, other factors will be more important for the future, or new factors may 
appear forwards.

Abstract 
The advancing technology and innovations change the world rapidly. Both countries and companies need to make 
fast and effective decisions to keep up with the changing conditions and make our world sustainable. Accordingly, 
this study aims to present a Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) based Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-
Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) methodology for assessment of sustainability action areas. HFLTS is applied to 
propose experts’ assessments by addressing the difficulty of expressing opinions by uncertainty. This technique 
provides flexibility by eliciting comparative linguistics expressions, resulting in an assessment environment closer to 
human thinking. The combined AHP-ARAS methodology offers many benefits such as ease of use for applying, the 
ability to overcome complex situations, the simplicity with which it may be extended to diverse fuzzy environments, 
flexibility, checking the consistency of decision-making. Plus, it considers the criteria's hierarchical structure and 
provides a direct and proportional relationship with the criteria weights. The criteria, consisting of sustainability 
action areas, are weighted with the Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL) AHP method. Then, industries such as 
chemical, information technology, food production, apparel, etc. are evaluated with the HFL ARAS method. To 
illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, an illustrative study is also provided. The results of this paper 
showed that the most appropriate criterion is “Increasing resource efficiency” and the first ranked industry is 
“Chemical Industry ”. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Dueto the changing market needs, the rapid development of technology, volatile customer demands, increasing 
energy needs, and sustainability issues, many industries have to revisit their organizational structure (Jamwal et al. 
2021; Escursell et al. 2021). The United Nations defined sustainability in 1987 as “filling the requirements of the 
present without compromising future generations' ability to fulfill their own needs.” (United Nations 1987). 
European Union’s political and legal framework about sustainability creates pressure for an organization in terms of 
global challenges and objectives. Therefore, organizations are expected to realize sustainable actions such as 
decreasing their carbon emissions to decarbonize the global economy in the medium term. However, in the long 
term, proactive sustainability management requires both following laws and foreseeing and preparing for future 
regulations (Federal Ministry for the Environment 2017). 
To keep up with the changing circumstances and create a sustainable world, the organizations have to make fast and 
effective decisions considering the future. After releasing the United Nation’s  2030 Agenda, which consists of 
seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the number of methodological assessments, frameworks, 
guidelines, and academic studies on sustainability has increased. However, the achievements of all the SDGs 
necessities complex decision-making processes, considering many criteria and trade-offs between goals (Sousa et al. 
2021).Therefore, in this study, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is utilized to support the 
decision-making of sustainability.

According to results in Table 10, the sustainability action areas have mainly affected the “Chemical Industry (A1)”. 
The ranking of the second, third, fourth, and fifth industries are Food Production Industry (A3), Apparel Industry 
(A4), Information Technology Industry (A2), and Service Industry (A5), respectively.  
6. Conclusion
The SDGs aim to achieve sustainable development and welfare by monitoring progress on a global scale through 
fundamental indicators. These targets are overarching objectives that present goals for all countries, including the 
least developed, developing, and developed countries. The sustainability action areas need to be implemented in the 
right environment and suitable industries to support these goals. 
This paper aims to present the HFL AHP-ARAS methodology for assessing sustainability action areas. The 
evaluation criteria were weighted with the HFL AHP method. Then, industries such as the chemical industry, 
information technology industry, food production industry, apparel industry, etc., were evaluated with the HFL 
ARAS method. The most appropriate criterion was found as “C13.Increasing resource efficiency” and the first 
ranked industry was determined as “Chemical Industry (A1)”. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed 
methodology, an application was also provided. 
For future studies, the decision-making problem can be handled by employing aggregation operations for the GDM 
to aggregate DM assessments. On the other hand, various fuzzy set extensions may be implemented into the

Abstract 
Disaster management is vital, and it faces a variety of problems. It is a form of governance that aims to plan, direct, 
support, coordinate, and effectively implement the activities that should be done before and after the event to prevent 
disasters and reduce their damage. Disaster management has a multi-faceted, multi-actor, multi-disciplinary, dynamic, 
comprehensive, and complex structure. In this context, the study aims to propose an action plan evaluation framework 
for disaster management and to prioritize these action plans with Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL) Simple Additive 
Weighting (SAW)-ComplexPRoportionalASsessment (COPRAS) methods. Considering the complex and uncertain 
nature of this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Terms Sets (HFLTS) is 
employed. This technique is applied to provide flexibility to experts using comparative linguistic expressions and 
obtain an evaluation environment closer to human thinking. The integrated HFL SAW-COPRAS methodology is 
practical, flexible, reliable, robust, adaptable to different fuzzy environments, and maximizing the benefit while 
minimizing the cost of alternatives. The evaluation factors and action plans are determined based on a literature review 
and experts' consulting. HFL SAW method is applied to find the weights of evaluation factors, and action plans are 
prioritized with the HFL COPRAS method. An illustrative application of disaster management is provided to illustrate 
the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Finally, the results of this paper showed that the most appropriate 
factor is“Risk Planning and Control,"" and the first ranked action plan is ""Planning & Organization"".

1. Introduction
Disaster management has arisen as a perceptible global subject as disasters, both artificial or natural, might happen 
anytime, anywhere with tremendous results. By definition, disaster is an environmental, technological, or artificial 
event that causes physical, social, and financial losses intersects regular life and human activities for the society. 
Disaster management has four main functions: planning, operation, logistics, financial and administrative affairs. In 
this paper, we have focused on logistics functions in disaster management. 
Logistics, an inseparable part of life, has great importance in effectively sustaining all business activities in different 
sectors. Logistics is an indispensable activity in disaster management operations, whose primary purpose is to save 
human life and overcome the crisis process with the least material and moral damage. The uncertainty of disaster 
logistics and the possibility that the slightest malfunction and error in the process may cost human life reveals the 
necessity of error-free management of this process (Karatop 2017). Therefore, it is challenging to manage logistics 
processes in disaster management. 
The main objective of disaster management is the provision of search, rescue, medical first aid and treatment, and 
similar emergency services and needs in case of disasters. A practical action plan is necessary to meet the needs of 
vulnerable people in time. However, prioritizing action plans for disaster management problems has a multi-faceted, 
multi-actor, multi-disciplinary, dynamic, comprehensive, and complex structure. Therefore, in this paper, this problem 
is considered a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. 
The purpose of the paper is to propose an action plan evaluation framework for disaster management and to prioritize 
these

According to the result in Table 6, the most appropriate action plan is ""Planning & Organization (ACT1)"". The second, 
third, fourth, and fifth action plans are ranked as ACT2, ACT5, ACT4, and ACT3, respectively. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper aimed to propose an action plan evaluation framework for disaster management and prioritize these action 
plans using an integrated HFL MCDM approach. The weights of the factors were obtained with the HFL SAW method, 
and the HFL COPRAS method was used to prioritize action plans. 
 
An empirical study was shown to illustrate the methodology's efficacy, and the outcomes of this examination were 
presented. The most appropriate factor was found as ""F41. Risk Planning and Control,"" and the first ranked action 
plan was determined as ""ACT1. Planning & Organization"". As mentioned in paper (Adiguzel, 2019), all management 
activities, including planning, organizing, coordinating, communicating, ordering, supervising/evaluation, and so on, 
are critical in disaster management. 
 
For future investigation, different aggregation operators can be used to aggregate DMs' evaluations in group decision-
making. On the other hand, other extensions (e.g. elicit information,pythagorean fuzzy sets, spherical fuzzy sets) of 
fuzzy sets may be implemented into the framework.

Abstract 
Manual wheelchair users face many difficulties during their daily activities. These users demand a high amount of 
force from their upper extremities to move or turn. Due to exerting these forces over time, more pressure on the wrist’s 
median nerve is applied, and the users suffer from severe pain in their arm muscles.  In general, manual wheelchair 
users provide repetitive motion for an extended time leading to CTS. This study uses digital human modeling to 
investigate wrist deviation in radial and extension positions, body dimension, and gender on the maximum hand force. 
Three wrist radial deviation (i.e., 10°, 15°, and 20°), three extension wrist degrees (i.e., 25°, 35°, and 50°), both genders 
(i.e., male and female), and three percentiles (i.e., 5th, 50th, 95th) are involved.  Jack digital human modeling software 
was used to simulate the wrist's deviation and test different body sizes. Force solver in Jack software calculates the 
amount of maximum hand force for 54 combination runs. Analysis of variance was used to determine the significant 
factors. The results show that radial deviation has no significant impact on the maximum hand force, while other 
factors have a considerable impact. The male, in general, provides more strength than the female. A person with the 
95th percentile has less force than 50th, and both are less than 5th (62, 68, and 74, respectively). Wrist extension on 
25° provides 95 Neuton force which is the maximum between another extension angel.

1. Introduction
People with disabilities are the essential group in our community; their needs and requirements are specific to their 
capabilities and limitations. Around 15% of the world population is suffering from a disability, and 2.2% are living 
with limited function (World Report on Disability, 2011). In the USA 6.9% of the population reported movement 
disability (Erickson, 2019), and In Jordan, 651,396 people if age 5 years and old are suffering from disability 
(movement and other disability), around 4.8% of the total population suffer from movement disability (Disability 
Facts and Number in Jordan, 2017), most of them are using manual wheelchair to do their daily activities, usually, 
they stay at home and need aids. 
The manual wheelchair users have so many difficulties moving around due to muscle effort requirement and exertion 
(Collins et al., 2010). Manual wheelchair users may have Musculoskeletal disorders more than ordinary people, due 
to many constraints in their travel (Yoon, Yoo, Ha, Ji, & Kim, 1997). These disorders are mostly associated with upper 
extremity pain and injury (Boninger et al., 2000), many studies reach to number of factors affecting the upper extremity 
pain such as contact angle, rate of rise, and magnitude of peak forces and moments (Boninger et al., 2000; Boninger 
et al., 2005; Collinger et al., 2008), in addition to demographic information about the manual wheelchair users 
(Boninger et al., 2003; Dyson-Hudson & Kirshblum, 2004; Sinnott, Milburn, & McNaughton, 2000). 
This project's primary purpose is to ergonomically assess using the manual wheelchair on people with different 
demographics such as BMI and the type of movement required to operate the manual wheelchair like moving forward

6. Conclusion  
As conclusion, female who use manual wheelchair can provide less force than male, that is important factor when 
designing wheelchair for female, if there is an incline in the road, they move in then they need support if the wheelchair 
has no extra support system. Usually, the person who use manual wheelchair and not exercising regularly will be 
overweighed soon, they should be informed that when they reach high body mass index, they will be able to provide 
enough force to the wheel to move the chair as they want.  
 
Another important fact concluded from this project is the wrist deviation, most of the users will not notice the changes 
in their wrist extension, which may lead to less force and may cause pain in the hand due that awkward posture of 
wrist, when they trained to use the manual wheelchair, they should inform about the best posture to use. Small 
deviation in the wrist degree will significantly influence the amount of force they can provide to the wheels.  
 
In future, more wrist posture should be tested with should elevation angle as some studies indicates that deviation 
should also influence the force exerted to move the wheelchair. In addition, the result in this study is based on 
simulation run should be verified with real experiment after getting IRB acceptance.

Abstract 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution for fostering agile and resilient supply chains. Machine learning, 
natural language processing, and robotics are all potential enablers of supply chain transformation. Such AI 
technologies can be applied in different supply chain activities. However, selecting the most suitable AI technology 
is challenging since the features of supply chains changes for different organizations from various sectors. 
Accordingly, this study aims to present a fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)-Multi-Objective Optimization on 
the Basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) methodology for assessing thesuccess factors of AI application in Supply Chain 
Management (SCM). Fuzzy sets approach is applied to represent assessments of experts by handling uncertainty. The 
combined fuzzy SAW-MOORA methodology offers many benefits such as simplicity, usability, ability to overcome 
complex situations, flexibility, and simultaneously optimizing two or more conflicting attributes. The criteria, 
consisting of AI success factors, are weighted with the fuzzy SAW method. Then, AI technologies such as machine 
learning, autonomous systems, natural language processing, multi-agent systems, etc. are evaluated with the fuzzy 
MOORA method. To illustrate the effectiveness of the research methodology, an application is also provided.

1. Introduction
Globalization and digital transformation have drastically changed the way supply chains work. The new supply chains 
can be considered as a part of huge digital networks across different sectors and countries. Organizations aim achieving 
consistency, traceability and speed while considering their cost constraints, deadlines, and inventory optimization 
(Riahi et al. 2021). Therefore, Supply Chain Management (SCM) activities become more and more complex. 
To keep up with the changing SCM concept, and work well in complex environments, organizations have to creature 
silient and agile supply chains. In this context, many organizations use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in major parts of 
their supply chains. AI can be applied in various end-to-end supply chain activities with tools that help in augmentation 
to automation (Andersen et al. 2018).In recent years, applications based on AI have arisen in various fields. For 
instance, AI technologies can help organizations removing many levels of manual activities by predicting the trends, 
optimizing warehousing and logistics set prices, and personalizing promotions (Dash et al. 2019). However, there 
cannot be a standardized AI technology since the dynamic characteristics of supply chains are case based. They vary 
with every business and sector. Thus, in this study, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methodology is utilized 
to support the decision-making process of AI application in SCM.  
The aim of this study is proposing a fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)-Multi-Objective Optimization on the 
Basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) methodology for assessing success factors of AI application in SCM. Zadeh (1965) 
proposed the fuzzy sets to overcome the uncertainty in decision-making.In the literature, fuzzy MCDM approaches 
has been applied in many fields such as ERP system selection, facility location selection, personnel selection and 
logistics tool selection (Chou et al. 2008; Karande and Chakraborty 2012; Baležentis et al. 2012; Büyüközkan et al. 
2012). 
This study contributes to literature by applying the fuzzy SAW-MOORA methodology for the first time in AI 
application in SCM area. In this paper, the success factors for AI applications in SCM are determined based on

Then, the normalized matrix is weighted by using the criteria weights obtained in fuzzy SAW and by applying (8)-
(10).The overall ratings of alternatives are determined by applying (11)-(16). Finally, the overall performance index 
(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖) for each alternative is calculated to rank the alternatives by applying (17). The results of the fuzzy MOORA method 
are given in Table 7.

According to results in Table 7, the AI technologies can be ranked as:Machine Learning (A1), Natural Language 
Processing (A4), Semantic Web (A3), Multi-Agent Systems (A5) and Autonomous Systems (A2), respectively. 
6. Conclusion
AI praises the existing process, impulses the analytics and technology as well as supplements the talent within the 
supply chain. Applying AI results in continuous development, occasionally self-improved. AI canbe considered as an 
aid tool fororganizations to become more smart, agile, resilient, constructa customer-focused supply chain, and be 
demand-sensitive.  
This paper aimed to present the fuzzy SAW-MOORA methodology for assessing AI critical success factors and AI 
technologies in SCM concept. The critical success factors were weighted with the fuzzy SAW method. Then, 
technologies such as machine learning, autonomous systems, natural language processing, etc., were assessedby 
applying the fuzzy MOORA method. The most importantfactor was found as “Support consumer-driven objectives 
(CSF3)” and the first ranked AI technology was determined as “Machine Learning (A1)”.  
For future studies, it can be interesting to implement other fuzzy MCDM methods and compare the results with the 
existing methodology. Besides, other fuzzy set extensions (e.g. intuitionistic fuzzy sets, type-2 fuzzy sets, interval 
valued fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets etc.) may be preferred in future research.

Abstract 
Cities, the main living space of people, are one of the focal points of the concept of sustainability. Sustainable cities, 
which are of great importance in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aim to create the nests of our future and 
to support this approach with digital solutions. The sustainable city concept aims to define many different needs of a 
city from a macro perspective and to make that city more environmentally friendly and more livable with the 
planning and investments to be made based on this definition. At this point, digital solutions are needed to meet all 
the needs of the residents of the city and to ensure their welfare in a sustainable way. In this context, the evaluation 
of digital solutions for sustainable cities is considered a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem due to its 
mixed structure and many different criteria. However, it becomes difficult for experts to evaluate and make 
decisions about the system when the information is insufficient and uncertain. Therefore, in this study, the fuzzy 
approach is used to evaluate the MCDM problem more realistically and flexibly. The aim of the study is to propose 
an evaluation model and integrated analytic methods for the evaluation of digital solutions for sustainable cities. The 
fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to calculate the weights of the criteria and fuzzy Evaluation 
Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) is used to prioritize the digital solutions. Finally, an application 
is provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology.

1. Introduction
Today, 3.5 billion people live in cities and this number is increasing day by day. Cities cover 3% of the world's 
surface area. 60-80% of energy consumption and 75% of carbon emissions occur in cities. Cities will be the future 
of many people. Huge problems faced by humanity, such as poverty, climate change, health services, and education, 
need to be solved in cities. Cities need to be planned and built stronger. Choosing a sustainable path means building 
cities where every citizen has a quality life, benefits from the productive dynamics of the city, produces common 
welfare, and ensures social stability without harming the environment (United Nations 2015; Bai et al. 2016; Litman 
2021). At this point, it is necessary to correctly structure the concept of ""Sustainable City""with the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and to support this approach with digital solutions. Goal 11 of SDGs aims to provide 
access to housing, basic services, transportation services, and green spaces. It also calls for inclusive and sustainable 
urbanization and reducing the environmental impact of cities. Moreover, it promotes constructive economic, social, 
and environmental links between the city, its periphery, and the countryside (United Nations 2015). 
The sustainable city concept aims to define many different needs of a city from a macro perspective and to make 
that city more environmentally friendly and more livable with the planning and investments to be made based on 
this definition (Satterthwait 1997; Haughton and Hunter 2004). For this purpose, while environmentally friendly 
investments such as wind energy and solar energy are made for the city's energy needs, the infrastructure systems 
that will be used for the most efficient transmission and distribution of the produced energy are renewed (Hecht et 
al. 2012; Sodiq et al. 2019; Golubchikov 2020). 
At this point, digital solutions are needed to meet all the needs of the residents of the city and to ensure their welfare 
in a sustainable way. These digital solutions are supported by smart technologies such as artificial intelligence, the 
Internet of things, big data, and cloud computing. In this context, the evaluation of digital solutions for sustainable

According to the final weights, the most appropriate criteria are “Land use accessibility (C23)”, “Safety, security 
and privacy (C52)” and “Digital education (C33)”. These three criteria stand out from the other criteria with the 
values they receive.

At the conclusion of the fuzzy EDAS method, the most appropriate digital solution is “Digital government services 
and civic-engagement tools (DS2)”, while digital transportation management and e-hailing (DS1), digital healthcare 
services and health wearable devices (DS3), digital meters for real-time tracking apps in water and electricity 
consumption (DS5), and digital reskilling and learning programs (DS4) have positioned at the second, third, fourth, 
and fifth ranks as the final performance values, respectively. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This paper aimed to propose an evaluation model for sustainable cities and prioritize digital solutions using an 
integrated fuzzy MCDM approach. The weights of the criteria were obtained with the fuzzyAHP method, and the 
fuzzy EDAS method was used to prioritize digital solutions. 
 
An application was shown to demonstrate the methodology's efficacy, and the outcomes of this examination were 
presented. The most appropriate criteriawere found as “Land use accessibility (C23)”, “Safety, security and privacy 
(C52)” and “Digital education (C33)”, and the first ranked digital solution was determined as “Digital government 
services and civic-engagement tools (DS2)”. In the digital state process, information and communication 
technologies can be used to make public organizations more effective and efficient and strengthen democracy, as 
well as to enable citizens to access certain information over the internet, and facilitate certain transactions. Thus, it 
makes the political system and public administration more transparent, democratic, sensitive, and effective.

For future investigation, aggregation operators can be used to aggregate DMs' evaluations in group decision-making. 
On the other hand, other extensions (e.g. elicit information, pythagorean fuzzy sets, spherical fuzzy sets) of fuzzy 
sets may be implemented into the framework.

Abstract 
 
Procurement is the process that manages business relationships of suppliers, including negotiations or services, and 
plays a key role for the success of many companies. In this work we discuss some of the important aspects around 
procurement (and towards Procurement 4.0), including the main drivers, challenges, remedies, and benefits. The 
main drivers are related to efficiency improvements, risk minimization and reducing human efforts in procurement 
process. The challenges include the adaption to Procurement 4.0, data security and lack of employee trainings. The 
mainly remedies concern technology and data management. The benefits of improved procurement are process 
optimization with digitization, skilled supplier selections, on time demand fulfillment, and on time invoicing 
management. Recommendations for industrial procurement are provided aiming for achieving improved operations.

1. Introduction 
Today’s complexities of global commercialization impose more efficient and resilient businesses to cope with the 
fast-changing, dynamic and competitive market (Kuhlman 2018). For this, there is a need to streamline the 
businesses to be adaptive to such a fluctuating environment. However, diverse are the ways of improving the 
efficiency of business whereby the procurement process is one of the main attributes under consideration (Bienhaus 
and Haddud 2018). Still, many businesses’ workflow has convoluted patterns and outdated manual processes in 
which capital and time are wasted.  
 
Procurement is the process that manages business relationships of suppliers, including negotiations or services 
(Harland et al. 2019). These elements play a significant role in retailers when handling distributors, manufacturers, 
and suppliers. Procurement affects most of the business functions as it ensures that the services and items are 
acquired properly so that companies’ processes and projects can be proceeded efficiently (Heckman 2020). Hence, 
this step is a complex stage of the production of products or processes that requires experts to manage appropriately. 
In its current state of the organizational structure, the future of procurement moves to encapsulate the industry 4.0 
capabilities in its realm (Ghadge et al. 2019). Experts in this area refer that there is a trend to interconnected 
industrial production in an automated fashion. For that, there are a series of changes to be overcome for an 
achievable Procurement 4.0. This must be more precise and faster than current practices and policies in response to 
the organization's requests for a more agile, resilient, and interconnected process. In a parallel comparison with the 
evolution of the industry since the steam power transformation in mechanical movement, procurement 1.0 supported 
basic relational functions that were mostly manual and reactive (Guarnieri & Gomes 2019). Procurement 2.0 moved 
around the development of services in an integrated framework of diverse processes. Procurement 3.0 was based on 
collaborative work to a certain extent automated. In today’s commercial arenas, Procurement 4.0 supports the 
augmented information with cognitive analytics and adaptive functions that form the industry 4.0 pillars of the 
information and computing technologies (ICT), modeling and solving algorithms (MSA), and mechatronics (MEC) 
(Rejeb et al. 2018).","Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

are best for the companies as these are repeatable, measurable, and can hence be automated. There is 
another game-changer which is the availability of real-time data which enhances and increases the speed by 
which the buyers can react to the changes in the market.  The consistent information flow by the optimal 
network in the supply chain can help the organization in having higher added values. The networks like 
integrated systems can be decentralized which can help the professionals, suppliers, and procurement 
departments (Jahani et al. 2021). The challenges of moving from industry 4.0 to Procurement 4.0 involve 
meeting the future market needs; followed by the challenges in digital transformations which are often 
refused by the workers and employees who are often comfortable with traditional approaches. 
 
3. Recommendation for Industrial Procurement  
As for the industrial procurement, it is recommended to focus on centralizing the information, identification of 
inefficient processes, creating the policy for standardized procurement, strategic sourcing, feedback system 
establishment, professional development investment, the establishment of clear expectations, sourcing 
selecting/streamlining suppliers, educating the workforce, embrace lean procurement, negotiate better, investment in 
the talent for supply chain, information sharing, investment of automation in procurement, and evaluation of key 
performance indicators. It is recommended in the future to focus on the digital technologies in designing the supply 
network along with the relevancies of processes by utilizing smart technologies. Determination of irrelevancies in 
processes is important. It is recommended to consider the smart technologies which can influence the workers along 
with focusing on economic and social circumstances (Roscoe et al. 2019). In line with this, it is important to 
consider the instability and uncertainty in the market that can be tackled with the Procurement 4.0 application. Also, 
there are various operations management issues that need to be considered so that the implementation of Industry 
4.0 can be done correctly and successfully. It is recommended to analyze the issues like inventory management, fleet 
assignment problems, and vehicle routing problems (Harland et al. 2019). It is recommended to focus on the impact 
of various SC processes, procurement, and smart systems which have not been studied in previous studies.   
 
As previously mentioned, industries are not fully using technological innovations as such, for which it is 
recommended to provide technological aid for supporting physical work, along with the adoption of technology in 
processes. Examples include Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) that have programmed routes (De Ryck et al. 
2020). In line with this, it is recommended to further consider networking and digitization like artificial intelligence, 
simulation, virtual reality, and digital protection which can support the production in organizations. In addition, 
there are technological advancements around the world that require the consideration of technical components in 
procurement. For this, it is recommended to allow the software to collect data and analyze it by using sensors. This 
can further be done by placing tags on the products which can also help in tracking goods and keeping the inventory 
well managed. Also, as computers require more space, miniaturization of components and machines is needed for 
better performance as well as for reducing the storage and CPU requirements, resulting in more space (Afzal et al. 
2019). In line with this, it is essential to adopt nanotechnology as it is the part of miniaturization which enables 
better processes and Procurement 4.0 implementation. Finally, it is essential that companies and businesses provide 
training to their skilled and unskilled employees in all facets of Procurement 4.0. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In line with the above discussion, it has been concluded that Procurement 4.0 is crucial for different companies 
operating around the world. For instance, there are different drivers of Procurement 4.0 to tackle multiple challenges 
that are explored in the context of the implementation of Procurement 4.0. In this paper, we provided remedies that 
can help in smooth Procurement 4.0 implementation, in addition to main benefits and recommendations for 
organizations so that they can successfully implement Procurement 4.0. It is worth to highlight the need to focus on 
innovation, technological improvement, and personnel training for improved Procurement 4.0.

Abstract 
The steep increase in the global tank container fleet, pushes for a precision engineering management of terminals 
ofISO tank containers on a local and worldwide scale. An ISO tank is a container that is built to the ISO (International 
Organization for Standardization) stands and designed to carry hazardous and non-hazardous bulk liquids. ISO tanks 
offer a safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation package for moving bulk liquids around the world. Several 
companies are joined to properly transport raw materials and products around the globe, including logistics and supply 
chain providers as rail carriers, motor carriers, terminal operators, cleaning, and repair facilities, manufactures, 
brokers, etc. In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by one of these ISO tank value chain organizations -the 
depot service providers -in order to find opportunities for improved processes with the support of Industry 4.0 
technologies. Inside the depot service facility, such novel capabilities may create an augmented information-driven 
environment for an optimal operation, thus enabling decision-makers to take actions based on real data provided by 
daily status updates that will minimize accessorial charges and other expenses instead of human-oriented based 
decisions and executions.

1. Introduction
A globalized economy involves the transportation of raw materials and finished goods around the globe. For the 
transportation of gases and all sorts of bulk liquids, tank containers are the most appropriated vessel. There are several 
types of tank containers to transport various fluids as gases and liquids. Manufacturers must comply with ISO 
standards to guarantee the tank containers are built following the required specifications to hold and contain the loaded 
products according to their properties. 
According to the International Tank Container Organization (2022), the size of the global tank container fleet in 
January 2022 was 736,935 representing a growth of 7.3% compared to January 2021.Events such as the COVID-19 
pandemic and, more recently, the war between Russia and Ukraine have caused several supply chains issues and 
increased freight rates, forcing companies to look for alternatives to move products more efficiently. The impact on 
the global container industry is a shortage of containers. The reasons for the global container industry's supply chain 
problems have been well-documented in newspapers and trade journals. Increased volumes from a wide range of 
cargoes from Asia – as well as space-shortages on containerships, port congestion, and inland transport delays – these 
are all factors which have contributed to increased tank container demand in 2021 (International Tank Container 
Organization 2022) 
Alongside the shortage of space on-board containerships, the tank industry also faces a shortage of tank container 
cleaning and repair capacity, with investment and expansion of tank depots generally not keeping in line with global 
tank fleet expansion. The depot service provider is an essential link in the tank container supply chain, but it seems to

4. Depot Service Operation Challenges and Opportunities 
The main question is: ""how do we minimize service time for all services without compromising the quality of service?"" 
 
Fora proper match of the service time, determining when a tank is placed on cleaning, or repairing, or testing station 
is fundamental. This also includes when the tanks are prepared to leave these stations. By tracking tanks' movements, 
assignments, and any other logistics operation inside the depot service facility using IoT devices, a better decision-
making of the steps of the operations can be made. 
 
Communication and computing capabilities to track tanks inside the depot services facility without or with minor 
human intervention may be challenging. Existing solutions relying on RFID technology would require changing some 
workflows because it would demand the attachment and removal of the RFID tag from the tank container. According 
to Wang et al. (2006),some practical and critical issues need to be addressed, with the main issue being the high cost 
of RFID active tags and readers, making the adoption of this solution by a depot service provider impracticable. 
 
Considering the maturity level of the industry 4.0 and artificial intelligence, it is an opportunity to use computer vision 
techniques to read the tank container's identification number and record its ID and location information on a database. 
By tracking the tanks’ space and time variations, it allows the development of key performance indicators (KPI) for 
their logistics operations. Currently, the depot service facilities operate without a systematic database on the tank 
locations and the operation itself. Below is a list of possible KPIs for monitoring the operations performance: 
• 
Average handling in/out time 
• 
Average cleaning time 
• 
Average repairing time 
• 
Average testing time 
• 
Residence time in the storage container yard 
• 
Average residence time in the storage container yard per tank operator/lessor  
 
When determining the average time to clean up a tank (containing residue of a specific type) can enable the operations 
manager to plan the allocation of the cleaning stations ahead of time. Information such as the residence time per tank, 
average residence time per tank operator/lessor, tank's location in the storage container yard, and the forecast of 
requested tanks per tank operator can be used by a decision support system to help define the best location per tank in 
the storage container yard. Having the information about all tanks' locations at any given time presents an excellent 
opportunity to create a depot service provider digital twin. A digital twin would allow a depot service provider to 
simulate changes in the depot service facility, such as increasing the number of cleaning stations or adding a new 
street for forklift/stacker transit, and understanding their impact before actually dedicating financial and people 
resources to execute them. 
 
5. Conclusion 
It seems possible to improve service times by adding technology to the depot service provider facility. The tanks' 
location and all their events over time are crucial information for the depot service operations. It gives the ability to 
create key performance indicators for monitoring the operations providing data for the operations manager to make 
better decisions. It enables optimizations in the yard container space planning, focusing on reducing forklift/stacker 
movements, perhaps causing a reduction in CO2 emissions. It powers the ability to create a depot digital twin that can 
be used to simulate improvements in the facility. The digital twin can also be used by tank operators/lessors to visualize 
the position of their tank containers in the yard container before booking tanks for a customer.

Abstract 
New and better products attract more consumers and yield higher profits.  However, developing 
better products usually takes longer, allowing other products to appear and take away a market 
share. Moreover, the product development process involves uncertainty about the time, cost and 
quality of the end product.  Innovators must take this uncertainty and  tradeoff into account in 
determining their product development strategies.  We model innovation competition as a 
stochastic game, study its equilibrium, and characterize socially optimal innovation.

Abstract 
The pandemic has severely affected the way people do things. Necessary rules and regulations have been implemented 
to ensure the virus would not further spread. The logistics industry is one of the sectors greatly affected by the 
pandemic since some industries are required to perform their respective work in a face-to-face setting. Meaning the 
workers have a high chance of being exposed to the virus. The study aims to identify whether workers from various 
logistics companies have experienced any risks during the pandemic regarding the physical, chemical, ergonomic, and 
biological extent. Moreover, surveying 250 logistics workers found that most have been experiencing ergonomic risk 
factors, which has made them perceive their health and safety risks as mild, given the current situation.

1. Introduction
With a total net worth of USD 13 billion in 2019, the thriving logistics industry has always been a notable element in 
the Philippine economy. The philippine logistics market was forecasted to develop from 8.2 to 8.8% between 2018 
and 2024, according to a study by The Lobien Realty Group (2020). This emphasizes how beneficial the logistics 
market is, as it provides unconventional services like warehousing, inventory management, freight forwarding, and 
multimodal transportation. Since the flow of materials between and among countries has become increasingly 
complex, today's global value chains demand a higher level of resilience and efficiency for companies to function 
effectively. Companies can do this by outsourcing their logistics operations to third-party logistics service providers, 
particularly those that can provide coordinated, end-to-end solutions. 
China is a massive consumer of agricultural and industrial products worldwide. The influence of COVID-19 was first 
noticed here, given that its importance in global manufacturing was greatly affected. Being the heart of the pandemic, 
Wuhan, China, is also the epicenter of more than 200 Fortune Global 500 firms. With the slow response of most 
countries, the pandemic started to expand globally, resulting in a halt in trade and closure of borders. Integrating 
additional regulations to maintain worker safety, like physical distancing in warehouses, is attributed to freight 
bottlenecks. 
While allowing unlimited unpaid leave, third-party logistics protect employees' health by establishing new social 
distancing protocols at warehouses, sanitizing work locations, or supplying protective gear. OSHA standards indicated 
that the fatal accident rate for the warehousing industry is greater than the state median for all sectors, meaning that 
health and safety should be addressed for long-term warehouse operations. Identifying all hazards and risks that could 
cause fatal injury or death is the first step in preventing such things from happening. Although the employer supervises 
overall hazard assessment, workers must recognize the hazards around them. In the logistics industry, work conditions 
consistently change, especially for delivery service riders; these workers must be attentive to their surroundings and 
identify all possible risks on an ongoing basis.

hazards. On the other hand, regarding health risk, chemical and ergonomic hazards obtain the highest Pearson 
Correlation value resulting in 0.577 and 0.654, respectively. Both results indicate a high association between two 
variables, which connotes that once people with chemical and ergonomic hazards exposure increases, their perception 
of health risk also increases. This means that people tend to be more mindful of their health once exposed to these 
hazards.

4. Conclusion 
The logistics sector has thrived exponentially in the Philippines, forecasting a growth of 8.8%. This increase shows 
that logistics benefits the economy since it focuses on providing services such as warehousing, inventory 
management, freight forwarding, and multimodal transportation. Being the most crucial sector in the market, the 
continuous growth of employees and workers within the work environment is beneficial for a quick and smooth 
operation and transportation flow. However, as we are in a pandemic sector, the logistics operation makes it their 
priority to establish protocols and sanitation systems and utilize protective gear to ensure the safety of their 
employees. Furthermore, workers must also recognize these types of hazards to protect themselves from injuries 
and accidents. In addition to aiding workers and establishments in the importance of safety and health, this study 
targets to specify and assess the risk of employees working in a logistics industry within the Philippines during the 
pandemic. This will ensure that workers will be protected, and establishments can create plans and safety guidelines 
to guarantee the well-being of their workers. Results were gathered from different logistics companies using an 
online survey and printed questionnaire. The gathered results show that ergonomic and chemical hazards are the 
most significant factors contributing to workers' safety and health risks. Since most of the workers in the logistics 
sector are delivery riders utilizing motorcycles, they are exposed to awkward posture and repetitive tasks in their 
arms, hands, and risk. 
Furthermore, since motorcycles are rear-wheel vehicles, delivery personnel are exposed to bacteria, chemicals from 
smoke, and environmental factors. Additionally, when workers were asked about their working conditions, they 
considered them tolerable. Though, once they are exposed to these types of hazards, workers become mindful of 
their safety and make it their priority to protect themselves from these kinds of risks. These results and findings 
show that safety and health assessment is crucial as it prevents not only minor health problems but also long-term 
medical issues. 
 
Results show that factors under ergonomic hazards have a high correlation based on the workers' activities, followed 
by biological hazards, especially in exposure to virus or disease, given that COVID-19 is still a threat. The respondents 
perceive their work under mild risk in terms of safety and health, this may seem moderate, but this can significantly 
affect one's work performance and productivity. Safety management must be taken seriously by employers, and

improvement for safety and health management must be mandated by companies, requiring stricter safety practices 
and seminars. Companies may combine forces with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in directing 
stricter health and safety protocols to prevent future occupational injuries and diseases. Safety climate in the logistics 
industry was always in a struggle; tremendous effort and participation of the employees are required. With these 
efforts, employees will habituate safety practices, develop camaraderie, and create a harmonious environment in the 
workplace. For future research, it is recommended to gather more respondents with different employment statuses and 
try to gather respondents outside NCR.

Abstract 
The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries globally, mainly because of its geographic location. It is prone 
to natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and even tsunamis. Hence, the Filipino people 
need to be ergonomically prepared for disasters. The study aims to determine the factors affecting the preparedness 
and readiness of Filipinos during the disaster. Factors considered in the study are based on the domains of Ergonomics 
such as physical, cognitive, and macro-ergonomics. The online survey was developed and distributed to 206 Filipinos 
residing in Mindanao, Philippines, to obtain their perception of disaster preparedness and readiness. Pearson 
correlation analysis was utilized in the study to determine the significant association between the ergonomic factors 
to the perceived disaster and the readiness of Filipinos. Results of the study proved that access to the media and other 
sources of information, being informed on the evacuation plan, trust in the government, LGU preparedness, and 
receiving financial support from the government has a significant relationship to the preparedness and readiness of 
Filipinos during disasters. As a result, better information on disaster safety measures, evacuation protocols, increased 
access to information, and government support is recommended. Because of this study, people will be more aware of 
disaster preparedness and response behavior.

1. Introduction
Belonging to the pacific ring of fire, the Philippines was acknowledged as the third country most vulnerable to disaster 
risks. According to PAGASA (2014), an average of 20 tropical cyclones enter the Philippines in a year, five (5) of 
which are destructive. Along with these tropical cyclones are earthquakes. According to the Philippine Institute of 
Volcanology and Seismology (2019), an average of twenty (20) earthquakes occur daily. A total of one hundred to 
one hundred fifty are felt every year. These are just two types of disasters that hit the Philippines in a year, and many 
times, these occur in a year and cost the lives and livelihood of the Filipino people. Recalling all the natural disasters 
suffered by the Filipinos, thousands of lives had been lost, and millions of Filipino people had mourned their loved 
ones. They were displaced, and billions worth of the destruction and damages had been experienced due to all disaster 
events. This has led the government to provide more attention to disaster risk reduction. 
Without any doubt, the Philippines has endured a lot of destructive calamities that have ruined places and even lives. 
That is why disaster preparedness and readiness must go beyond any emergency measures. According to Hyogo 
Framework for Action (2005), the number of recorded disasters went from 200 to 400 per year, and nine out of ten

6. Conclusion
Natural Disasters are indeed unavoidable and unpredictable. Even if years pass, the risk, danger, and fear brought by 
these unfortunate events will always be there. No one can stop a natural phenomenon from happening. Hence, it is 
imperative to spread awareness, education, and preparedness to reduce the vulnerability brought by these unwanted 
events. In this study, the knowledge of the Filipinos regarding the role of ergonomics in the perceived preparedness 
and readiness during the disaster was determined. It was proved that access to the media and other sources of 
information, being informed on the evacuation plan, trust in the government, LGU preparedness, and receiving 
financial support from the government was the most critical factors affecting the preparedness and readiness of 
Filipinos during disasters. As a result, better information on disaster safety measures, evacuation protocols, increased 
access to information, and government support is recommended. Because of this study, people will be more aware of 
disaster preparedness and response behavior.

Abstract 
The online learning system has been implemented since the sudden global spread of the coronavirus in 2020, forcing 
students to continue school in their households. This study assessed the relationship between household noise levels 
and the perceived task performance difficulty of undergraduate students from select private schools in the Philippines. 
An online survey was conducted, and 202 respondents participated in the 3-part questionnaire consisting of 
demographics, Noise Exposure Scoring, and Task Performance Difficulty questionnaires. The last two sections were 
in the form of a 4-point Likert Scale. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics to demonstrate the result 
summary in each category and correlation for determining if there is a significant relationship between noise levels 
and the perceived task performance difficulty. The results showed a moderate positive association between total noise 
exposure and memorization, analysis, and organization. On the other hand, noise exposure was found to have a weak 
relationship to judgment and theory application. The result indicated that the students' total noise exposure 
significantly affected the difficulty of their task performance. Thus, evaluating the impact of noise on cognitive and 
performance functions would help explain the mental consequences of poor performance.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continuously disrupted almost all existing systems: economic, social, 
agricultural, and public health, after its sudden unexpected onslaught, and it primarily modified the means of 
communication and engagements of various sectors and industries (International Labour Organization  2021). The 
unprecedented health crisis has pushed governments of each country to implement lockdowns, which consequently 
included the indefinite closures of all educational institutions, forcing schools to resort to the abrupt execution of 
remote learning (Donnelly et al. 2021). All face-to-face learning activities in the classroom have been halted to prevent 
COVID-19 transmission among students and school employees, and all classroom instruction is mandated to occur at 
home. 
This current online learning environment leverages internet access, technical devices and resources, several online 
learning media for synchronous and asynchronous instructional delivery, and academic program management (Huang, 
2019; Usher & Barak  2020). Synchronous online learning entails real-time interactions between the teacher and the 
students, whereas asynchronous online learning takes place without a set schedule for different students (Singh & 
Thurman  2019). One of the countries which were quick to adopt this system was the Philippines, but this was recently 
changed through the approval of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) of the limited face-to-face classes for 
all degrees in tertiary education back on November 5, 2021 (Rocamora  2021)

and entering the house, traffic noise, opened doors and windows, door noises, call noises, noise from the people 
outside, running water noises, appliance noises, exterior house noises, and hobby noises from people in the house. 
 
Pearson correlation analysis found a moderate association between noise exposure and memorization, noise exposure 
and analysis, and noise exposure and synthesis & organization. On the other hand, judgment making and theory 
application had a weak correlation to noise exposure. Thus, it can be inferred that the noise level exposure and the 
various noise pollution sources in the online class environment significantly impact their task performance difficulty. 
 
This confirmed the principal concept of the impact of noise in the physical work environment as it is expected for 
noise sources to cause physiological and psychological effects on humans. Some possible effects that can be presumed 
in the case of students include distraction, annoyance, and interference with people's thinking and cognitive processes, 
which students are expected to experience when engaging in online classes inside their households. In conclusion, the 
formulated null hypothesis for the correlation analysis was accepted, and the alternative hypothesis was rejected as 
the results suggest that the total noise exposure and level of the students have no significant impact on their perceived 
task performance difficulty. It should be considered that the sample size for the respondents is relatively small because 
of the time constraints, and it should be noted that this might have contributed to the results of the study.

Abstract 
Digitalization is increasingly imperative for companies that want to achieve a competitive advantage, which represents 
the transformation of traditional processes into digital processes by incorporating Industry 4.0 technologies. It is also 
known that to move towards this digital transformation it is necessary that the company already presents a good level 
of maturity in terms of lean philosophy, so the latter can be seen almost as a prerequisite. For a company to be 
successful in this digital transformation journey, it must develop a roadmap for digitalization, which guides it until it 
reaches the final goal, and there are already some guidelines to develop them. Therefore, by analyzing the literature it 
is possible to notice that there are not many technological tools that support this roadmap yet. This work contributes 
to filling the gap in the literature by describing a tool developed through the Microsoft Power Platform software that 
supports the roadmap for digital transformation in the collection and selection of processes, to develop an action plan 
aligned with the company's long-term strategy. This tool was then tested by the potential users, to validate the model, 
know the level of receptivity of the application by users, and understand the usefulness of the tool.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, it is already known that “The adoption of Industry 4.0 is no longer a choice.” (Butt 2020). Industry 4.0 
(I4.0) is linked to the adoption of cyber-physical systems, which represent the connection between the physical and 
the digital world (Salvadorinho and Teixeira, 2021; Tambare et al. 2022). The fourth industrial revolution raised this 
concept of I4.0 and brought along several technological advances, which caused the need for some processes to 
become digital, through the incorporation of emerging technologies (Antonucci et al. 2021; Mahraz et al. 2019; Vigren 
et al. 2022). In this way, digitalization can be seen as the process of upgrading the traditional industry to digital, 
revolutionizing the ways in which organizations operate by seeking greater process efficiency through the use of I4.0

This work contributes to filling the gap in the literature about tools that support the roadmap for digitalization, as it 
presents a technological solution to help the execution of an action plan, through the conclusion of which processes 
should be digitized. For this, an app was developed using the software Microsoft Power Platform.  
With this app, it is possible to reach this action plan by prioritizing processes according to the corresponding ICE 
index value, which is previously parameterized by the company, to be aligned with its long-term strategy. Furthermore, 
it enables the evaluation of indicators (KPIs) which are also defined in accordance with the organization's strategy, to 
understand the current state of the company compared to what it intends to achieve. 
Even though this study fills a literature gap, it also has limitations, namely the fact that the case study was carried out 
in a company of a specific context of industry, so there is no guarantee that it can be applied to organizations operating 
in different contexts. 
For the reason stated above, it would be interesting, as future work, to validate the tool in other types of industry 
sectors since it was only created considering a single organization from a single sector.

Abstract 
The role of employee performance has a dominant influence in the process of achieving organizational goals, because 
with new ideas, problem solving skills and seizing opportunities or accuracy in making decisions. Many factors can 
affect performance, such as job satisfaction, remuneration, and work environment. The purpose of this study was to 
determine the effect of remuneration and work environment on satisfaction and its impact on performance at public 
institution. This study used quantitative approach, with samples of 250 respondents from 2125 populations of Civil 
Servants at Public Institution in Musi Rawas Utara. The sampling technique that was used is simple random sampling. 
Samples were taken randomly from 3 public institutions in Musi Rawas Utara. The analysis technique used in this 
study was Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis approach. The results showed that there is a positive (0.73) and 
significant (t-value 3.96) effect between remuneration on job satisfaction. There is a positive (0.13) but insignificant 
(t-value 0.75) effect between the work environment on job satisfaction. There is a  very weak (0.08) and insignificant 
(t-value 0.30) effect between remuneration on performance. There is a positive (0.33) and significant (t-value 1.99) 
effect between the work environment on the performance. There is a positive (0.55) and significant (t-value 3.04) 
effect between job satisfaction on performance.

Introduction 
Every organization certainly has organizational goals. One of the factors needed in order to achive these goals is the 
human resource factor (Santoso.  2017). Human resources that are managed and directed properly can create 
employees who have discipline and high performance. The role of employee performance has a dominant effect the 
process of achieving organizational goals, because with new ideas, problem solving skills and seizing opportunities 
or accuracy in making decisions. Performance is the result or work performance (output) both in quality and quantity 
achieved by human resources in carrying out their work assignments, in accordance with the responsibilities and time 
given (Syawal et al.  2019). Based on the results of interviews by researchers with one employees public institution 
of Musi Rawas Utara with the initials TS, on Monday, January 17, 2022. TS said that he often experienced a decline 
in performance, because he often did not complete assignments on time and the work results were not as expected. 
Limited time in completing tasks, and inadequate facilities made his performance as an employee not optimal. 
Employee performance is influenced by several factors, negative factors and positive factors. Positive factors that can 
improve performance include remuneration, work environment and work discipline. Remuneration is a reward or 
award for employees as a result of good performance in the organization, including by giving gifts, awards and 
promotions (Jusmalini.  2011). Based on data from the 2022 Work Plan at Employee Institution of Musi Rawas Utara. 
The Employee Work Evaluation Program has not been implemented at Musi Rawas Utara, making the staffing sector

There is a very weak positive effect between remuneration on performance of 0.08 with a t-value of 0.36 and 
statistically not significant because the t-value is smaller than the t-table (1.96). This means that there is no significant 
effect of remuneration on performance.Remuneration is intended to stimulate employees to be motivated to do a much 
better and maximum job (Aswathappa in Rapsanjani & Johannes 2019).In line with Jusmalini's research (2011) 
Remuneration is a reward for employees as a result of good performance in the organization.. Research 
findingsResearch findings that remuneration does not significantly affect job satisfaction. This condition illustrates 
that remuneration management at at Public Institution of Musi Rawas Utara does not significantly affect the 
performance of Civil Servants. According to Maheasy Enny (2019) there are other factors that affect performance, 
namely abilities and expertise, knowledge, work design, personality, work motivation, leadership, leadership style, 
organizational culture, job satisfaction and others. 
 
There is a positive influence between the work environment on performance of 0.33 with a t-value of 1.99. Statistically 
it can be stated that there is a significant effect between the work environment on performance because the t-value is 
greater than the t-table (1.96). This means that the more comfortable the work environment, the higher the 
performance. The work environment is everything that is around employees that can affect employee job satisfaction 
in carrying out their work so that maximum work results will be obtained, where in the work environment there are 
work facilities that support employees in completing tasks assigned to employees in order to improve employee work 
in a company (Enny Mahmudah, 2019). JIf the employee likes the work environment in which he works, the employee 
will feel comfortable in working and carrying out his activities so that work time can be used effectively. Productivity 
will be high and automatically employee performance will also be high. (Anggi, 2015).  
 
There is a positive influence between job satisfaction on performance of 0.55 with a t-value of 3.04. Statistically it 
can be stated that job satisfaction has a significant effect on performance because the t-value is greater than the t-table 
(1.96). This means that the higher the level of job satisfaction, the performance will also increase. Employees who 
have job satisfaction tend to have positive feelings about their work. Someone who has a high level of satisfaction 
will have high motivation and productivity. The findings of this study indicate a significant effect on job satisfaction 
on performance. This means that the level of employee satisfaction at Public Institution of Musi Rawas Utara is very 
influential on performance. Supported by Enny (2019) that the factor that affects performance is job satisfaction. 
Feelings of pleasure or joy or feelings of liking someone before and after doing a job will also affect the work of 
employees. So job satisfaction can affect performance. 
 
 
Conclusion 
The conclusions of this study are 1) There is a positive and significant influence between remuneration on job 
satisfaction. 2) The positive but not significant effect of the work environment on job satisfaction. 3) There is no 
significant effect of remuneration on performance. 4) There is a positive and significant influence between the work 
environment on performance. 5) There is a positive and significant influence between Job Satisfaction on Performance. 
Based on the results, some suggestions are needed as follows. Management of remuneration for employees is felt to 
be still not carried out properly, so it is necessary to carry out employee management through: 1) Performance 
Evaluation; 2) Giving Rewards/Awards; 3) Giving Bonuses; 4) Position Promotion. The need of development of the 
work environment at Public Institution of Musi Rawas Utara through the addition or procurement of facilities and 
infrastructure that support performance so that employees feel comfortable and safe so as to improve the quality of 
employee performance in at Public Institution of Musi Rawas Utara. The limitation of this research is that it uses a 
purely quantitative approach, so that future researchers can conduct this research by adding qualitative research.

Abstract 
COVID-19 as a global pandemic has changed the situation and conditions in the field of learning. To reduce the spread 
of the new coronavirus, learning activities are carried out online. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behavior of teachers and students at junior high schools in Palembang. This 
research method uses a Survey approach. The research population is the State Junior High School in Palembang. Then 
the sampling technique used is a systematic sampling quota with 200 respondents. Data analysis was carried out with 
structural model equations (SEM) assisted by the LISREL 8.8 application. Data collection was carried out using 
questionnaires distributed through google forms. Based on the results of the analysis that has been carried out, this 
study concludes that there is an impact of the pandemic affecting teacher behavior but not affecting student behavior 
directly, but teacher behavior affects student behavior. Then the impact of the Coronavirus Disease affects the behavior 
of teachers, so teacher behavior has a direct impact on student behavior, which depends on how teachers apply to learn 
during the pandemic against students.

1. Introduction
The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in the worldwide Covid-19 Pandemic which was first detected in 
Wuhan City, Hubei, China on December 31, 2019. The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia revealed that 
the first covid-19 case in Indonesia on March 02, 2020, was detected in two people who were confirmed to have 
contracted it from a Japanese citizen. Then, on April 9, 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic spread to 34 provinces 
throughout Indonesia. However, the provinces that are most exposed are DKI Jakarta, West Java, and Central Java. 
That way, the government implements restrictions on interactions. (Ministry of Health Republic English  2020)The 
purpose of the physical distancing policy is to break the chain of the spread of the Covid-19 virus. 
According to reference data from the Ministry of Education and Culture as of April 2022, in the city of Palembang, 
there are a total of 502 Public and Private Junior High Schools spread across 18 sub-districts, namely 502 Junior High 
Schools. In Palembang, there are as many as 61 State Junior High Schools spread across the 18 sub-districts. The city 
of Palembang is in the Red Zone status, which means that the existing covid level has increased high. Previously, 
schools in Palembang conducted face-to-face learning. However, based on data, there are as many as 11 schools whose

Learning activities can be done at home using various Learning applications, such as space, teacher, class, Zoom, 
Google Docs, Google from, or Whatsapp groups. Following the creativity of the teacher in providing material and 
practice questions to students, learning activities can be carried out very well and effectively, and the question 
exercises carried out by students can be used as a result of daily student learning  (Dewi, 2020). 
 
5.2.2 
Impact of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) on Student Behavior 
Based on the results of data analysis in this study, it was concluded that there was no impact of Corona Virus on 
student behavior. This is in line with research conducted showing that Cahyawati and Gunarto (2020) it has a direct 
impact on the behavior of students. The results of research conducted with students showed that students were still 
hampered in participating in online learning, only 15% of respondents expressed their approval of online learning, 
argued that the task load was more, still had difficulty receiving material, it was still very interested in meeting and 
getting explanations from lecturers. 
 
In line with the research conducted by  Syafa’ati et al. (2021) that in learning online learning, students experience 
more difficulties in learning. Student learning achievement is difficult to monitor directly by the teacher. The 
application of online learning is slower than in-person learning, due to the long and unscheduled learning time. This 
free learning time is what allows children to learn freely to determine when to study. In learning, children become 
bored and lazy to study, because free learning time will make bad habits that will affect students to form less character 
or personality. The application of effective and efficient learning methods to online learning will affect good learning 
achievement. 
 
5.2.3 
Impact Teacher  Behavior Towards Student Behavior 
Based on the results of data analysis in this study, it was concluded that there is an impact of teacher behavior on 
student behavior. In line with the research conducted by proving that there is a positive and significant influence on 
teacher behavior on student behavior (Fathurrohman 2018). Teacher behavior affects the achievement and behavior 
of students in learning The results of the study prove that the learning restations of the student are influenced by 
teacher behavior. Teachers who have good behavior can give words full of motivation with enthusiasm so that students 
feel confident that they can overcome all difficulties in completing tasks while helping to improve their performance. 
Meanwhile, when a teacher delivers a lesson with full pressure and rigidity, students can feel uncomfortable with the 
teacher. (Fane & Sugito  2019b) 
 
The results of this study show that there is a positive and significant influence of teacher behavior on the achievement 
of learning mathematics of students (You et al., (2016). Based on the findings of the study, it is explained that teachers 
who have good behavior can give a speech that is full of motivation with enthusiasm so that it makes students feel 
confident that they can overcome all difficulties in completing tasks while helping to improve performance. 
Meanwhile, when a teacher delivers a lesson with full pressure and rigidity, the student feels uncomfortable with the 
teacher and of course, this makes the student's confidence and performance to overcome difficulties and complete 
tasks less. For this reason, a teacher is needed who understands the physical and psychic condition of students. Thus, 
the behavior of teachers in the learning process greatly affects the learning achievement of students. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the field of education.  Originally, learning activities 
were carried out in schools. However, since the Covid-19 pandemic that has hit all parts of the world, learning activities 
have been carried out from home.  Learning activities are carried out online, namely by utilizing an internet connection.  
This change has an impact on the behavior of teachers and students. 
 
Based on the results of research conducted to determine the impact of  Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) on the  
Behavior of  Teachers and Students in  State  Junior High Schools, it can be concluded that there is an impact of the 
pandemic affecting teacher behavior but does not affect student behavior directly, but teacher behavior affects student 
behavior. Then the impact of the pandemic affects teacher behavior, so teacher behavior has a direct impact on student 
behavior, which depends on how the teacher applies to learn. during the pandemic against students.

Abstract 
The number of land and building tax objects is increasing every year.  Along with the development of Palembang City 
as the capital of South Sumatera Province. The realization of Land and Building Tax Revenues always does not reach 
the targets that have been set. This shows that the level of compliance of Land and Building Taxpayers in Palembang 
City is still relatively low.  The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of trust and transparency on the 
godliness of land and building taxpayers in Palembang City.  This study used a quantitative approach through a survey 
of 358 Land and Building Taxpayers from 9 sub-districts in Palembang City. A sampling of research using the 
sampling cluster technique with the determination of the number of respondents using the slovin formula. Data 
analysis techniques use a structural equation model (SEM) approach assisted by the application of LISREL 8.80. 
Based on the results of the analysis show that Trust has no positive effect and is significant to taxpayer compliance. 
This is because the trust of taxpayers is influenced by the responsible policy of the tax authority in resolving tax 
problems.  Furthermore, Tax transparency has a positive and significant effect on taxpayer compliance.  Transparency 
and the Trust of taxpayers have a positive and significant effect. Thus, tax management must be transparent in 
providing information and managing taxes openly to the public to improve taxpayer compliance for the people in 
Palembang City.  
Keywords: Trust, Transparency, Taxpayer Compliance 
1. Introduction
The Palembang City Government is one of the regions in South Sumatera Province that is experiencing rapid economic 
development.  In line with the increasing activities that occur in the community and the growing potential of the City 
of Palembang, the largest potential of Palembang City Regional Original Income is sourced from taxes. Based on data 
from the Accountability and Performance Report of Government Agencies of the Palembang City Regional Tax 
Management Agency in 2020, it is explained that the regional tax revenue of Palembang City in 2020 was IDR 
786,044,838,483.00 or 66.05% of the target of IDR 1,190,000,000,000.00.  
Every year there is an increase in the amount of data collection on land and building tax objects but not all UN 
taxpayers are diligent in paying their Land and Building Taxes. The following describes the arrears of Land and 
Building Tax per sub-district area presented in Table 1.

5.2.3 
The Influence of Transparency on Land and Building Taxpayer  Trust 
The results showed that there was an effect of Transparency on the Trust of Land and Building Taxpayers of 0.25 with 
a t-value of 4.37. Statistically, it can be stated that there is a  significant influence because the t-value is greater than 
the t-table which is 1.96. This means that the higher the Transparency, the more TrustTransparency gives the 
government a great opportunity to improve taxpayer compliance. When the taxpayer feels that the government is not 
transparent it will then react by trying not to pay the tax.  Research results conducted on tax transparency and taxpayer 
trust affect taxpayer compliance, this means that with tax transparency and taxpayer trust together, it will increase 
taxpayer compliance (Rahma  2019). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Taxpayer compliance is a state in which the taxpayer is aware to carry out his obligation to pay taxes by applicable 
regulations. Taxpayer compliance is related to tax revenue because the increasing compliance of taxpayers will 
indirectly affect state or regional revenues. However, there are cases of tax evasion that make taxpayers think that the 
tax revenue collected by the government is mostly used for personal interests, not for public interests or regional 
development. 
 
It takes taxpayer trust in the government so transparency is needed to increase that trust. If the government provides 
clear information regarding the use of tax revenue funds, it can improve taxpayer compliance. Tax transparency is the 
openness of the government in allocating or using funds from tax revenues for regional development or other needs 
of local governments.  The existence of transparency carried out by the government creates trust so that with 
transparency carried out the government can increase the trust of taxpayers who have been paid by taxpayers used as 
well as possible by applicable regulations. Tax transparency affects taxpayer compliance. The more transparent the 
information managed by the government, the more compliant the taxpayer will be to his tax obligations and the 
avoidance carried out by the taxpayer will also decrease.  Thus transparent tax governance will increase trust and trust 
will increase taxpayer compliance.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to systematically review the strengthening of the concept of customer experience in 
themed restaurants and to find out what variables affect customer experience at themed restaurants. This research is 
based on researches relating to customer experience at themed restaurants. The research applied three databases: 
Science Direct, Emerald, and EBSCO. The literature reviewed is customer experience at restaurants in the last 10 
years, specifically 2012 to 2022.There are only 13 researches on themed restaurants from 2012-2021. Researches 
applied 23 independent variables and 5 dependent variables in examining themed restaurants. The limitation of this 
research is that the researcher only examines published research regarding customer experience at restaurants that 
have a special theme with a time span of 2012-2022.The implication of this research is that stakeholders can 
consider customer experience as an important factor in the hospitality and tourism industry, especially in restaurants. 
Some of the variables shown in this study can be a reference for stakeholders in improving customer experience at 
themed restaurants. This research has a big impact on society because it affords to increase the value of a restaurant. 
This has the potential for visitors to come back. The originality of this research is that there is no literature review 
that discusses customer experience and the variables used by researchers in themed restaurants.

1. Introduction
Experience has become a widely used strategy to be integrated across all industries. In particular, experience may 
increase consumption because consumers are looking for a better experience and prioritize hedonic feelings, so 
industry practitioners need experience factors to consider the right strategy and design memorable experiences for 
the sustainability of their companies (Pine and Gilmore 1998). Experience is the main factor of consumption 
because experience is the most important part of an individual's life. Consumer experience has largely been 
conceptualized as a holistic phenomenon that is specific to an individual towards an event in a particular context. 
Experiences have special meaning for individuals because experiences are highly subjective and imply that they 
involve an emotional aspect, or evoke feelings. Therefore, each experience is unique and the consumer has a 
personal connection to the experience (Kauppinen‐Räisänen et al. 2013). 
In recent years, consumer habits for eating at a restaurant have changed. Eating out has become a common everyday 
behavior for many people (Cheng et al. 2020). Analyzing motivation in food tourism is important for restaurant 
managers because most visitors go to restaurants to eat and fulfill the most basic physiological needs. The 
motivation for food consumption and tourism is closely related because food can provide emotional stimulation and 
is a major contributor to the overall travel experience (Chang et al. 2021).

6. Conclusion
The conclusion of this study is that along with changes in consumer behavior, previously consumers went to 
restaurants just to eat, but now consumers go to restaurants to travel. Many restaurants have offered special themes 
in their restaurants. The theme given is the original theme of the country/place of origin. Restaurants that have 
special themes can provide benefits for tourism managers because visitors have great potential to make repeat visits. 
The special attraction of a restaurant that has a unique theme is an experience that cannot be felt anywhere else. 
Previous research has shown that visiting decisions, customer experience, customer satisfaction, repeat visits, and 
word-of-mouth are the variables that are the focus of researchers in conducting research on themed restaurants.  
The limitation of this research is that the researcher only examines published research regarding customer 
experience at restaurants that have a special theme with a time span of 2012-2022. Future research can go further for 
the time span of the research and examine customer experience in other hospitality industries such as hotels, cruises, 
lodging, etc.

Abstract 
Online investment is an investment activity when viewed from the age range, these investors are dominated by the 
millennial generation. There are many examples of mutual fund online investment applications that have been 
widely downloaded by the public, for example, Ajaib. Sentiment Analysis is a technique for extracting text data to 
obtain information about positive, or negative sentiment. This research aims to analyze sentiment on user reviews of 
online investment applications, namely Ajaib by utilizing review analysis on the Google Play Store. Ajaib is a 
mobile application-based online stock and mutual fund investment platform that was simultaneously released in 
2019, where its users are millennials.  The many differences in online investment applications make Ajaib one of the 
superior applications in investing. This study aims to determine whether or not there are differences in features in 
terms of applications and services, prices, and promotions on interest in using the Ajaib application. The K-Nearest 
Neighbor method can help overcome the classification of opinions that are positive, or negative. After testing with K 
of 12, the highest accuracy results were obtained when K = 11 with an accuracy value of 85.0% with a precision of 
90.2%, recall 87.5%, f1 value 88.8% with a tendency to also obtain reviews of the Ajaib mutual fund application 
tend to be positive.

1. Introduction
There are various types of financial assets that investors can choose to invest their money. Included in the various 
types of financial assets. Mutual fund investment is often seen as an attractive investment for beginners, due to the 
relatively low and stable transaction costs. This can help investors to minimize risk and have greater certainty about 
the returns they may earn. Sentiment analysis usually refers to feelings, emotions, attitudes or opinions. Since 
textual data is used, there is a need to analyze the concept of expressing sentiment and calculating insights to explore 
businesses.By using the K-Nearest Neighbor method, researchers want to further examine the comparison of factors 
that influence interest in using the Ajaib application. Then classification will be carried out using the KNN (K-
Nearest Neighbor) algorithm to determine whether the reviews on the data obtained are positive or negative. 
1.1 Objectives 
The formulation of the problem in this study is to compare whether the Ajaib mutual fund is better than previous 
research in terms of its accuracy value using TF-IDF extraction features, labeling using Lexicon Based and KNN 
grid search methods. 
2. Literature Review
The use of the internet is able to influence people through the internet; we can get information, in addition, we can 
also give positive and negative opinions for certain reviews. By providing a lot of data or information on the 
internet, we use it for processing so, it will have new knowledge. Based on that, the author makes research, such as 
opinion classification by analyzing sentiment through a text mining approach, in this research; a method that is able 
to classify opinions accurately is needed. The scope of this research is the review of travel agents data processing 
using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm which uses 100 positive reviews and 100 negative reviews with six

data that is closest to the test data. In other words, the K-Nearest Neighbor calculation functions to determine the 
closest distance. Data that has gone through pre-processing will become training data for data to be tested by 
measuring proximity to existing data. The distance calculation that will be used in this research is Euclidian 
Distance.(Dicki Pajri Yuyun Umaidah 2021) 
 
First, the classification process is carried out using the K-Nearest Neighbor method, after the data is classified into 
review categories, the next step is to find the highest probability value to classify test data in the most appropriate 
category, the test data is a document from the review. There are two stages in the classification of documents to be 
used. The first stage is training on documents whose categories are already known, while the second stage is the 
process of classifying documents whose categories are not yet known.(Rasenda et al. 2020) 
 
5.4  Confusion Matrix  
Confusion Matrix is currently is a widely used tool in evaluating performance is a measurement of accuracy or 
performance for classification problems (Putri Fitrianti et al. 2019) where the output can be two or more classes. 
Confusion Matrix is described by a table of 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values. There are four 
terms that represent the results of the classification process in the confusion matrix: True Positive, True Negative, 
False Positive, and False Negative. At this stage, method testing with Confusion Matrix is carried out. Testing in this 
case is described by the accuracy testing stages of the K-Nearest Neighbor method. This test is carried out to 
determine the accuracy value in the classification of Ajaib application reviews on the system that has been created. 
The system being tested has a number of classes, namely 2 sentiments, namely positive and negative, including a 
multi-class classification system. This accuracy test is carried out using Confusion Matrix where a matrix of 
predicted results will be compared with the original class of input data. This test was carried out using test data of 
20% of the total data of 1001 data, namely getting an accuracy of 85% in Figure 1.. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Confusion Matrix 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the final project research, it can be concluded that the sentiment of users of the magic mutual 
fund application gives more positive reviews. The k-nearest neighbor classification modeler in this study gets an 
accuracy value (85%). The data used is 1001 datasets taken directly using the scrapping technique on Google 
Playstore. With a test accuracy level of Recall 87.6%, Presicion 90.2%, F-measurement 88.9% shows that the test 
accuracy results are greater using Presicion of 90.2%.

Abstract 
Digital Provider In simple terms, this digital operator is an application-based prepaid card service that can be found 
on the Google Play Store and App Store. Live.On is a digital provider in Indonesia which has features such as 
freeing its users / users in choosing quota, topping quota, cellphone numbers can choose according to Live.On 
application recommendations, getting SIM cards and how to pay in just one application. Digital Provider users in 
Indonesia from the last year are growing rapidly. Sentiment Analysis identifies emotions and opinions both positive 
and negative. The Naïve Bayes method can be used to classify opinions into negative, and positive opinions. This 
research tries to take advantage by analyzing Google Play Store reviews and Indonesian-language reviews that talk 
about the Digital Provider brand. The stages of sentiment analysis in this study consist of retrieving data in the 
playstore using scrapping, pre-processing, lexicon based, naive bayes data classification, data evaluation and data 
visualization. Preprocessing is done by case folding, cleaning, tokenizing, and temming. The results obtained are the 
accuracy level obtained by the results of positive sentiment as much as 247 data, negative sentiment as much as 753. 
and using 80% training data and 20% test data from existing data. then the acquisition of results with classification 
using the naïve bayes method the accuracy value is 87%, recall is 81%, precision is 61% and F1 is 69%.

1. Introduction
Digital Provider In simple terms, this digital driver is an application-based prepaid card service that can be found on 
the Google Play Store or App Store. Other Digital Providers such as By.u, MPWR, PowerUp, and Live.On 
themselves have the same scope so it is necessary to research the extent of public interest, views on Digital Provider 
Live.On. The main difference is that with conventional prepaid services, all activities can be done digitally through 
applications or official websites.  
Live.On is a digital provider in Indonesia from the XL Axiata company, Live.On was first created in Indonesia on 
August 17, 2020, but Live.On was only published on October 5, 2020 virtually where XL's 24th anniversary was 
taking place. Live.On here tries to make it easy for customers to make data package transactions. Live.On designed 
the application so that purchases can be made efficiently without having to meet. This also adapts to the potential 
when the market is in a COVID- 19 pandemic like today. where users are limited when transacting in person. 
Live.On has features such as freeing its users / customers in choosing quotas, beating quotas, cellphone numbers can 
choose according to recommendations from the Live.On application, getting simcards and payment methods in just 
one application, and cards will be sent for free / and can get die-commerce cards by using expedition services that 
already bear the shipping costs. So for Millennials it is very interesting Digital Providers like Live.On, and for the 
stoner interface system it is easy to understand so that novice users will not feel confused or difficult. Digital 
Provider users in Indonesia from year to year continue to grow rapidly.(A. R. Susanti 2016) 
The aspects that drive satisfaction include product quality, price, service and ease of use or network. Application 
requests such as Google Playstore make it easy for users to get applications, and also the user review process can be 
done directly through comments provided by Google Playstore. Reviews on Google Playstore have a standing or

negative data. The false negative data value is determined by counting all values other than the actual 
positive row for each class. 
Recall: TP/(TP+FN)  
c. 
 F-Measurement 
F-measure A special retrieval success parameter called F-measure combines recall and precision. The F-
measure value is calculated by multiplying the product of recall and precision by the sum of recall and 
precision, then dividing by the result. Accuracy is defined as the percentage of all sentiments that are 
correctly detected. Accuracy is computed by dividing the number data and test data by the number of true 
positive sentiment data. 
F-Measure is equal to 2*(Precision*Recall) / (Precision+Recall). 
d. Accuracy 
Accuracy is defined as the percentage of the total feelings that are correctly detected. The accuracy 
calculation is determined by splitting the total data and test data by the number of correct sentiment data. 
Accuracy is equal to (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the final project research, it can be concluded that the sentiment of users of the live.on digital 
provider application is more negative reviews than positive reviews where the use of lexicons helps to label positive 
and negative classes so that the process and results of the naïve bayes classification model in this study get an 
accuracy value (87%). The data used is 1000 datasets which are taken directly using the scrapping technique on 
Google playstore. With a recall test accuracy rate of 81%, presicion 61%, f-measurement 69% shows that the test 
accuracy results are greater using recall.

Abstract 
Financial performance is an important indicator for holders and stakeholders to assess and make decisions 
for a company, one of which can be seen from the level of Return On Assets (ROA). The higher the ROA of a 
company, the better the company's performance in generating profits from its assets. The ROA condition of 
Indonesian Banking since 2016-2019 has increased which then fell in 2020. 
This study aims to determine how the influence of Intellectual Capital and Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) on conventional banking ROA either partially or simultaneously. The population of this study is the 
conventional banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period as many as 
41 companies. The number of samples taken was 25 conventional banks which were selected through purposive 
sampling method. The research method used is panel data regression analysis. 
The results showed that Intellectual Capital and Corporate Social Responsibility simultaneously had a 
positive effect on conventional banking ROA. Partially VAHU and VACA have a significant effect on ROA, 
while STVA and CSR have no significant effect on ROA in conventional banking.

Background
In 2020, the increasingly extreme conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic caused Indonesia's economic
conditions to weaken, so that many people and business actors were unable to pay their debts. To overcome this 
problem, banks need to spend funds to carry out debt restructuring programs. This causes a decrease in profits 
that affect financial performance, one of which is Return On Assets (ROA). Banking financial performance is 
a key indicator for policy and decision makers because it is the foundation for the stability and functioning of

Table 4 shows that the probability value (F-statistics) is 0.000000 < 0.05, then Ha is accepted, meaning 
that Intellectual Capital and Corporate Social Responsibility simultaneously have a significant effect on Return 
On Assets. 
4.4.2 
Partial Hypothesis Testing (T Test) 
In this study, the independent variables used include Value Added Human Capital, Structural Capital 
Value Added, Value Added Capital Employed, and Corporate Social Responsibility, while the dependent 
variable used is Return On Assets. The significance rate used is = 0.05. 
Table 5. T Test 
Based on table 5 it can be explained that: 
a.
The VAHU probability value is 0.0001 < = 0.05, then Ha1 is accepted, meaning that Value Added Human
Capital has a partial significant effect on the financial performance of conventional banks listed on the
Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period.
b.
STVA probability value of 0.0721 > = 0.05 then H02 is accepted, meaning that the Structural Capital
Value Added does not have a significant partial effect on the financial performance of conventional banks
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period.
c.
The VACA probability value is 0.0003 < = 0.05, then Ha3 is accepted, meaning that Value Added Capital
Employed has a significant partial effect on the financial performance of conventional banks listed on the
Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period.
d.
The probability value of CSRDI is 0.9498 > = 0.05, then H04 is accepted, meaning that Corporate Social
Responsibility does not have a partial significant effect on the financial performance of conventional banks
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period.

Conclusion
Based on the results of the study, simultaneously VAHU, STVA, VACA, and CSR together have a
significant effect on financial performance as proxied by ROA. Partially VAHU and VACA have a significant 
effect on the company's ROA. VAHU is a measure in assessing the contribution of the workforce in the form 
of knowledge, skills, innovation, and creative ideas. To support this capability, companies need to spend funds 
to create added value. The more company spends on employee funds, the more value of the benefits obtained 
by the company will increase the asset turnover value of the company's income. So the company's employees 
are able to carry out their work well. Then, VACA is a measure of the value added of tangible assets, which is 
one of the company's resources that has a linear relationship with the probability of the company. The greater 
capital issued by banks to increase their equity, it will improve the company's financial performance. while 
STVA and CSR have no significant effect on the company's ROA. VAHU, STVA, VACA, and CSR have 
55.5% ability in explaining ROA.  
The suggestion for companies is that this research is expected to be a reference for companies to pay more 
attention to the funds spent on structural capital so that they are efficient because they do not have an influence 
on the company's financial performance. Then the company also needs to streamline Corporate Social 
Responsibility activities because more companies are able to disclose CSR activities will not affect financial 
performance. Investors are expected to pay attention to aspects of the company's Intellectual Capital, especially 
human capital and Corporate Social Responsibility to make investment decisions. For academics, it is hoped

that it can be a reference for research on Intellectual Capital and Corporate Social Responsibility on financial 
performance. Meanwhile, for further researchers, the authors suggest that future researchers do not conduct 
research on Intellectual Capital and Corporate Social Responsibility together because the objects used are 
limited due to not all conventional banking companies disclosing CSR in annual reports.

Abstract 
Beauty and femininity are the main selling points of the cosmetic industry centering on women. However, due to the 
Covid 19 pandemic, the demand for man cosmetic products significantly increases.  Thus, this study intends to 
identify the behaviors of male consumers towards the interest in buying skincare products. To address the issue, the 
present study deployed a quantitative method embracing SEM using LISREL application. Through this framework, 
the study which involved 381 Kahf's Instagram followers as the sample analyzed the consumer’s behaviors under 
which eleven hypotheses were broken down and examined. The results showed that perceived value, brand image, 
religious belief, halal certification, trust, and attitude affect men's purchasing behaviors.  In contrast to these seven 
factors, the religious belief aspect has the lower effect on the consumer’s halal awareness. Of these three mediator 
variables, attitude is found to be the main driving factor. The findings signify that brand image, religious belief, trust 
and halal awareness built in consumers are reflected in their attitude. Further research is expected to analyze the role 
of women, the main target of the skincare market, towards the men’s preference in purchasing skincare products.

1. Introduction
Beauty products have been acknowledged as the most selling points within the cosmetic industry. Although they are 
originally designed for women, the products have recently attracted the attention of men encouraging the high 
demand for the men’s cosmetic care.  The results of a survey done by Yuen et al. (2018) bears justification to the 
claim that 64.4% of men pay attention to their skin condition. The data shows a change in perspective in which more 
men become more aware of and concerned about the importance of appearance (Sanny et al. 2020). In addition, the 
increase in the percentage of men's skin care products in western countries is predicted to have an effect on the new 
demand for these products in developing countries (Khan et al. 2016).  It is in line with the conclusion of the 
Euromonitor 2021 survey which indicates that the awareness of self-care and beauty care in men in Indonesia will 
continue to grow. This is evident in the increasing number of purchases of men's care products such as soap and 
other toiletries. Reported in the Jakartapost.com, the demand for the beauty and personal care products in Indonesia 
has soared with a fantastic increase in online sales turnover since the enactment of Large-Scale Social Restrictions 
(PSBB) by the government in June 2020. 
The surge in demand for the cosmetic products described above has encouraged competition among skin care 
product companies in Indonesia, especially in this digital age. It is parallel to Chaffey and Chadwick’s (2016) 
statements stating that, in the digital age, the threat of product replacement has become an inevitable issue 
considering the benefits of technology which allows products to be easily introduced and expanded. This situation 
certainly affects the buying process undergone by the consumers putting an urgency to the company to take all this 
issue into account to maintain costumer’s trust and satisfaction. The company, for instance, may involve social 
media to engage and interact with the costumers, especially the millennial ones which eventually may affect the 
online buying activity (Dabbous and Barakat 2020).

interest. This finding may be due to the respondent’s age which are at the state of maintaining their physical 
appearance which clearly explains their attitude toward the products  
 
Last but not least was the results of the H11 testing. The test reveals that a person's buying interest is influenced by 
his or her awareness of the page of a product. These findings share the same consistency with those of Shahid’s et al. 
(2018); Nurhayati and Hendar’s (2019) studies which showed that halal awareness is an important partial mediator 
that strengthens its correlation with the consumer buying interests. The findings indicate that Muslim men who are 
aware of the halal certificate of Kahf products have a tendency to make purchases on the Kahf products in the future. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The present study set out to investigate the factors that may contributes to the men’s buying interest. Taking all the 
results together, the study generates several important conclusions.  First, men's buying interests are strongly 
influenced by their attitude, halal awareness and trust in the brand. Of these three variables, attitude is found to be 
the main driving factor. The findings signify that brand image, religious belief, trust and halal awareness built in 
consumers are reflected in their attitude. The positive attitude can be maintained by the provision of the programs 
that involve the costumers.  Therefore, it is expected that the companies provide programs that can be a place to 
nurture consumers’ positive attitude towards the brand.  
 
Second which relates to Halal awareness, the findings have shown that the costumers are well aware of the 
importance of halal status in the products they consume. This means that consumers will be more receptive to 
products that have guarantee on their page. Kahf and similar companies may take the findings into consideration by 
providing products that have been certified as halal both in the materials used and in the manufacturing process.  In 
addition, the halal awareness owned by the respondents can be treated as a foundation for halal policy makers and 
other relevant parties to always prioritize product guarantees.

ABSTRACT 
The Industrial Pole of Manaus (IPM) is an important mechanism for regional development, in addition to enabling the 
conservation of the Amazon Rain Forest, operating through the granting of tax incentives and having the Basic 
Productive Process (BPP) as the main instrument of industrial policy. This article evaluates the BPP of the television 
product, the one with the highest revenue in the IPM, from the point of view of the manufacturing companies, using 
a specifically built Maturity and Readiness Model (MRM) composed of six dimensions: search for inter-regional 
balance, adding value to production, achievement of governmental macro-goals, increase in job offers, promotion of 
sustainable use of biodiversity and maintenance of fiscal balance. Applied through a structured questionnaire based 
on the five-point Likert Scale, the MRM showed a global index of 3.59 out of 5, indicating an optimistic view of the 
manufacturers, especially in terms of job offers.  It was adjusted and validated using the methodology of partial least 
squares in structural equations modeling (PLS-SEM), using SmartPLS® 3.0  software.  Perspectives for future studies 
include the application of the developed MRM to other products with significant revenue and the extension of the 
research to other stakeholders, especially Governments (federal, state and municipal), research and development 
institutions and universities.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
This article analyzed the level of maturity and readiness of the Basic Productive Process (BPP), a public policy 
instrument for granting tax benefits to television manufacturers in the Industrial Pole of Manaus (IPM), in relation to 
the attributes established by the Federal Government  through the Inter Ministerial Ordinance 32/2019 and meetings 
of the Administrative Council of SUFRAMA. 
 
A Maturity and Readiness Model (MRM) was developed with six constructs (latent variables), namely: Search for 
Inter-Regional Balance (IRB), Added Value to Production (AVP), Achievement of Macro Goals Contained in 
Government Policies (MGP), Increment of the Employment Offer (IJO), Promotion of Sustainable Use of Biodiversity 
(ASB) and Maintenance of Fiscal Balance (MEF). These constructs were evaluated based on 29 indicators (observable 
variables), organized in the form of a structured research questionnaire using the five-point Likert Scale.  This 
questionnaire had 33 respondents distributed among the seven local manufacturers of the television product and the 
Global Average of the survey pointed to a Maturity and Readiness index of 3.58 on a maximum scale of 5, denoting 
an optimistic view of the BPP as a public policy instrument, highlighting the attendance of the latent variable increase 
in jobs offer with the highest value (4.23) while the achievement of inter-regional balance had the lowest score (2.68). 
 
Since this research was limited to television producers, a perspective for future studies, aiming to evaluate the IPM as 
a whole, would be to apply the developed MRM to other products with significant revenue.  Another important 
improvement, since all respondents are industry representatives, would be the extension of the research to other 
stakeholders, especially governments (federal, state and municipal), research and development institutions and 
universities. 
 
The builted MRM was adjusted and validated using the methodology of partial least squares in structural equations 
modeling (PLS-SEM), using SmartPLS® 3.0 software, being necessary to eliminate four observable variables to 
obtain the convergence of all the constructs of the Model. 
 
As a unique result of this article, we can point out the construction of a specific MRM for the BPP, a public policy 
instrument used in the IPM, validated through the application in a case study for the television product and PLS-SEM 
methodology, contributing to the advancement of knowledge about the MFZ, a public policy model that has been 
proven to induce socioeconomic development and environmental conservation in the Amazon.

Abstract 
A company has economic and social responsibility to maintain its business continuity. This study aims to determine 
the effect of profitability, risk minimization, political visibility, and slack resources on corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) disclosure. The population involved were companies in industrial sector listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange for the 2018-2020 period. 114 samples from 38 companies were obtained based on sampling 
criteria. The study data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and panel data regression. The study results 
showed that slack resources had a positive effect on CSR disclosure, since slack resources are company resources 
that are utilized and can adapt to current economic conditions, especially to perform corporate social responsibility. 
Meanwhile, profitability, risk minimization and political visibility had no effect on CSR. The limitation of this study 
was regarding the simultaneous effect that was only 7.11 %. Therefore, it is recommended to further researchers to 
observe other variables considered to affect CSR disclosure. The novelty proposed in this study was the effect of 
slack resources on CSR disclosure among industrial sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for

1. Introduction
A company has two main responsibilities. The first responsibility is financial responsibility. To fulfill this financial 
responsibility, the company is required to report its financial statements to investors and stakeholders. The benefit of 
the financial statements made by the company is to provide credible information to investors and stakeholders in 
order to make the right decisions. The second responsibility that must be met by the company is social and 
environment responsibility or so called Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Corporate social responsibility is 
disclosed in the sustainability report or in the company's annual report. The disclosure of corporate social 
responsibility aims to maintain the sustainability of such company to run its business and get the trust of investors 
and stakeholders. The implementation of the CSR program in the company can affect the sustainability of the 
company's business processes (Angela et al. 2021). 
The world's commitment to jointly pay attention to global sustainability is confirmed by the 2030 agenda for 
sustainable development, a joint agenda of global development adopted by 193 UN member countries. This 2030 
agenda document contains the goal of transformation for the future of the planet, with specific targets including 
poverty and hunger alleviation, health and education improvement, urban sustainability, climate change combat, and 
protection of oceans and forests (United Nations 2018).This commitment was delivered by 23 businesses from all 
over the world through a commitment letter to the United Nations in 2015. 
Although CSR disclosure in Indonesia is still voluntary, it still requires an appropriate legal framework to regulate 
the implementation of CSR disclosure by the company (Fahad and Rahman 2020).  Indonesia's commitment in 
regulating CSR, especially for companies, is regulated in Law Number 40 of 2007 concerning Limited Liability 
Companies, especially in Article 74 paragraph (1) which reads, ""The company that runs its business activities in the 
fields 
and/or 
relating 
to 
natural 
resources 
is 
required 
to 
carry 
out 
social 
and 
environmental 
responsibilities.""(President of Indonesia 2007). Furthermore, the Indonesian government also ratified the 
Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 47 of 2012 concerning Social and Environmental 
Responsibility of Limited Liability Companies. Article 2 states that each limited liability company must run social

The regression coefficient value for Profitability (β1) was 0.087155 with a probability level of 0.2688, which was 
higher than α=0.05. Thus, profitability had no effect on CSR disclosure. Such findings are not in accordance with 
the study hypothesis, and do not support the finding of study conducted by Ruslim et al. (2017) and Ali et al. (2018). 
Such findings were confirmed descriptively by study data that both profitability data were dominated by CSR 
disclosure value of above the mean value. That is why profitability had no effect on CSR disclosure.  
 
The regression coefficient value for risk minimization (β2) was 0.055005, with a probability level of 0.5048, which 
was higher than α=0.05. Thus, risk minimization had no effect on CSR disclosure. Such findings are not in 
accordance with the study hypothesis, and do not support the finding of study conducted by Ruroh & Latifah (2018) 
and Musallam (2018). Such findings were confirmed descriptively by study data that both companies that performed 
and did not performed risk management were dominated by CSR disclosure value of above the mean value.  
 
The regression coefficient value for political visibility (β3) was 0.016534, with a probability rate of 0.8932, which 
was higher than α=0.05. Thus, political visibility had no effect on CSR disclosure. Such findings are not in 
accordance with the study hypothesis, and do not support the finding of study conducted by Ali et al., 2018 
andWahyuni et al., 2019. Such findings were confirmed descriptively by study data that both political visibility data 
were dominated by CSR disclosure value of above the mean value.  
 
The regression coefficient value for slack resources (β4) was 0.200196, with a probability level of 0.0110, which was 
lower than α=0.05. Thus, slack resources had an effect on CSR disclosure. Such findings are in accordance with the 
study hypothesis, and support the finding of study conducted by Anggraeni and Djakman (2017).Such findings were 
confirmed descriptively by study data that the majority of slack resources data above the mean value was dominated 
by CSR disclosure value of above the mean value, and vice versa. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The results of the study indicated that slack resources had a positive effect on CSR disclosure. If the company had 
slack resources and was able to manage them well, it will be encouraged to disclose the CSR. Meanwhile, 
profitability, risk minimization, and political visibility had no effect on CSR disclosure.  
 
The limitation of this study was regarding the simultaneous effect that was only 7.11%. Therefore, it is 
recommended for further research to add other variables expected to affect CSR disclosure, such as leverage and 
women directors. The novelty proposed in this study was regarding the effect of slack resources on CSR disclosure 
among industrial sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2018-2020 period.

1. Introduction
During the pandemic in 2020 and early in 2021, financial services firms innovated at a pace much faster than in the 
past, (Marous 2022). The past two years of the pandemic have fast-tracked digital behaviors and redefined how 
customers engage with their banks. Banks and other traditional financial service provider have had to respond with an 
array of digitization and innovation initiatives. These initiatives employ cutting-edge technologies to ensure a 
customer-centric perspective rather than the traditional focus on products, real-time intelligent data integration rather 
than slow analysis being performed after-the-fact and open platform foundation. banks speed up their plans to close 
branches, digitize their experiences, and launch new ESG (environmental-, social-, and governance-focused) products 
and experiences, new entrants are doubling down on innovation to put their business in customers’ pockets, create 
new business models, and drive the next wave of transformation (Forrester 2022). Without an ongoing ability to 
embrace change and create updated solutions, banks will fall further behind industry leaders, negatively impacting 
customer satisfaction, operational (Marous 2022). 
An innovation strategy and culture is needed now more than ever to change the way organizations deliver financial 
services and the way modern technology can support new banking operating models. Often, innovation is required to 
catch up with both financial and non-financial leaders that have disrupted the banking ecosystem and altered consumer 
and business expectations. efficiency, and revenue growth, (Marous 2022). Organizational culture is a crucial issue 
that has a significant impact on innovation, an essential source of growth and development for each organization,

The regression coefficient for the independent variable of organizational culture is positive, indicating that there is a 
direct relationship between organizational culture and innovation performance. The organizational culture regression 
coefficient of 0.428 means that for every one unit increase in organizational culture, it will lead to an increase in 
product innovation performance of 0.428 units. 
5.4.1  Hypotesis Testing Total Model 
Hypothesis testing is carried out to prove whether organizational culture has an effect on innovation performance. So 
in testing this hypothesis used t test or partial test. The following is the result of the recapitulation of hypothesis testing 
on the total regression model.

Based on the table above, it can be seen that the t-value for the organizational culture variable is 19,053 with a p-value 
of 0.001. Because the t-count value is greater than t-table and the p-value is smaller than 0.05, hypothesis 13 is 
accepted. That is, organizational culture has a positive and significant effect on innovation performance. 
5.4.2 Coefficient of Determination Total Model 
The coefficient of determination is used to see the magnitude of the influence of organizational culture to 
innovation.performance The following are the results of the calculation of the coefficient of acceptance based on the

Based on the table above, it can be seen that the correlation coefficient value is 0.810 then the coefficient of 
determination (R2) is obtained a value of 0.656. This means that there is an influence between organizational culture 
on innovation performance of 65.6% while the remaining 34.4% is the influence of other variables that the researcher 
did not involve in this study. 
6. Conclusion
1) Using the VSM 2013, it’s found that The Organization Culture that implemented in Indonesian conventional banks
are in criteria high Power Distance, high Uncertainty Avoidance, Femininity, Long-Term Orientation, Collectivity
and Restraint dimension. This finding adding a new understanding of organizational culture in the banking sector.
Working relations in conventional commercial banks high Power Distance which implies that the working
relationship between superiors and subordinates is colored by behavior that prioritizes work professionalism,
prioritizing a hierarchical order which means that superiors in the perception of subordinates have the authority to
influence and superiors act actively in relation to the innovation performance. The Uncertainty Avoidance
dimension relates to the readiness of respondents at conventional commercial banks to face uncertainty in the
future and how the level of reaction will be in dealing with it. The Collectivity dimension is a trait that describes
the degree to which people prefer to act together in a group. Team goals are goals that must be achieved by group
members so that to achieve successful implementation of business intelligence, the application is carried out in
teams with an interconnected system.There is a tendency to shift cultural dimensions that lead to masculine
priorities, namely assertiveness, money, material and success. This can happen due to the stronger material culture
due to the demands of life which increasingly require money and a high appreciation of one's physical
appearance.in the Long Term Orientation implementation, performance achievements are evaluated from time to
time to ensure that annual targets can be achieved, in addition the bank makes periodic projections based on recent
achievements, conducts intensive monitoring and determines action plans and appropriate steps to achieve the

annual targets set by the Bank. task force to monitor the implementation of the business plan through the 
implementation of a business intelligence system. 
2) Using the Multiple Linear Regression All The dimensions of organizational culture has a positive impact on
Business Process Innovation and Product Innovation. The dimensions of organizational culture that have the
greatest influence on Product Innovation are high Power Distance, Femininity and Long-Term Orientation
dimension. Meanwhile, the dimension with the lowest effect is the uncertainty avoidance. The dimensions of
organizational culture that have the greatest  influence on Business Process Innovation are Long-Term Orientation, 
Restraint and Femininity dimension. While the dimension with the lowest influence is Collectivity dimension.
There were an influence between the dimensions of Organizational Culture inovation performance. There were
has a positive and significant effect influence between Organizational Culture on Innovation Performance.
3) The influence is in the form of implementation of organizational culture of high power difference dimension,
implementation of high uncertainty avoidance dimension, implementation of collective dimension,
implementation of feminine dimension, implementation of long-term orientation dimension of organizational
culture, implementation of retraint dimension, where Bank’s leader must pay attention to the organizational
culture, by being a leader who can be a role model for subordinates, Employees collectively achieve goals in work
teams, and share knowledge and knowledge with each other so that fellow employees gain experience and
knowledge indirectly and this makes other employees more responsive in carrying out their work. bank leader
should optimize team work and provide rewards and punishments accompanied by clear rules. Rules regarding
innovation performance are clearly stated in each work program and clear reporting on the achievement of
innovation performance aimed at bank stakeholders. Employees as team members must interact and evaluate
information in a timely manner to get the most suitable decisions for innovation performance improvement. As an
implementation of Longterm Orientation, bank used strategic plan, bank business plan and formulation of bank
focus that ensures sustainable business growth which is then poured into work plans and initiatives to be carried
out as well as targets to be achieved within the year. Performance achievements are evaluated from time to time
to ensure that annual targets can be achieved, in addition the bank makes periodic projections based on recent
achievements, conducts intensive monitoring and determines action plans and appropriate steps to achieve the
annual targets set by the Bank. Bank used task force to monitor the implementation of the business plan to achive
innovation performance.

This study finds out the simultaneous and partial effect intellectual capital, leverage, and audit quality on the 
financial statementa’ integrityof companies in the consumer goods industry listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
(IDX) in 2016-2020. Purposive sampling produced 32 samples which data of five years were observed hence 160 
data sets were observed. Panel data regression was used in the analysis assisted by the EViews 12 software. The 
results showed that the simultaneously, the independent variables of intellectual capital, leverage, and audit quality 
affected the financial statements’ integrity. Intellectual capital had a partial positive effect on the financial 
statements’ integrity, while leverage and audit quality did not affect the financial statements’ integrity. The results of 
this study can be helpful for further researchers as they add information, insight, and knowledge. Furthermore, 
companiescan consider their intellectual capital in improving the financial statement’s integrity.

1. Introduction
The consumer goods industry sector can produce or provide anything the community needs. The sector has six 
categories, namely food and beverages, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and household goods, household 
appliances, and other consumer goods industries. Correction of the stock price index is a term that indicates a 
movement, namely a decrease in stock prices or all stock market indexes by 10% or more (Ash-Shidiq and Setiawan 
2015). Dewi (2020) revealed that there are sector indexes that have been able to survive since early 2020, one of 
which is the consumer goods index, in which the consumption goods index has the lowest correction rate than other 
sector indexes. The company's good performance is how they present the financial statement with quality and 
integrity. Presenting quality financial statements by paying attention to the code of ethics in will produce financial 
statements with integrity.

statements in a positive direction. These results agree with the hypotheses built by previous researchers. The results 
also support previous studies conducted by Febrilyantri (2020) and Palebangan and Majidah (2021) which stated 
that intellectual capital affected financial statement integrity in a positive direction. It can be concluded that properly 
managed Intellectual capital, which is adequate and qualified knowledge, skills, and expertise, will have an impact 
on the good performance of the company's human resources, so that it can convey company information through 
financial statements that have integrity. 
 
5.2.2 
The Effect of Leverage on Financial Statement Integrity 
Leverage had a probability value (t-statistic) of 0.9278. This was greater than the significant level 0.05 (0.9278 < 
0.05). It was found that H2was rejected and that the leverage variable had no effect on financial statement integrity. 
These results are not in line with the hypotheses built by previous researchers. However, they are in line with Safitri 
and Bahri (2021) and Wahyuni (2021) who stated that leverage did not have an effect on financial statement 
integrity. It can be said that the companies’ leverage and whether the leverage is large or small would not influence 
the financial statement’s integrity because the company would do better and would develop if the company had debt, 
as the company's initial capital (Wahyuni 2021). 
 
5.2.3 
The Effect of Audit Quality on Financial Statement Integrity 
Audit quality had a probability value (t-statistic) of 0.3830. This value was larger than the significant level 0.05 
(0.3830 > 0.05). It was found that H3was rejected and that the audit quality variable did not have an effect on 
financial statement integrity. These results were not in line with the hypotheses built by previous researchers. 
However, the results were in line previous studies conducted by Safitri and Bahri (2021) and Serly and Helmayunita 
(2019) which stated that audit quality did not have an effect on financial statement integrity. According to De 
Angelo (1981), the audit quality proxy, namely the specialization of the auditor could not influence financial 
statement integrity. This is because the auditors’ ability to find or report indications of violations in the financial 
statements depends on their abilities, knowledge, skills, and techniques. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
6.1 Conclusion 
The results and discussion of this study, lead to the following conclusion. 
1. The independent variables, namely intellectual capital, leverage, and audit quality simultaneously affected on 
the financial statement integrity of companies in the consumer goods industry listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange (IDX) in 2016-2020. 
2. Intellectual capital, in a positive direction, partially affected financial statement integrity of companies in the 
consumer goods industry listed on IDX in 2016-2020. 
3. Leverage did not partially affect the financial statement integrity of companies in the consumer goods 
industry listed on IDX in 2016-2020. 
4. Audit quality did not partially affect the financial statement integrity of companies in the consumer goods 
industry listed on IDX in 2016-2020. 
 
6.2 Recommendations 
This study is expected to add information in accounting, especially on financial statement integrity. Furthermore, 
companies can consider making use of their intellectual capital to improve their financial statement integrity.

1. Introduction
Humans have a role in the ongoing life of the organization existing human resources, especially human resources 
become a very strategic resource in the progress of the times. Resources are the main factor in managing other 
resources. This should be a special concern of any university so that it can spur the development of education or more 
advanced competition between organizations. (Eldes  2018). As an element of teaching staff, the teaching profession 
has a dual function, namely the function of lecturers as implementers of educational services, managers in the field of 
education services, researchers and scientific developers, and administrators. They are expected to perform well in 
this function to achieve educational goals. Of course, these duties and obligations are not easy to achieve. (Asari 2019) 
Lecturers have the ability or different competencies Among one lecturer with others. Dimension competence lecturer 
(Asari 2019) distinguished Becomes three that is competencies professional, personal competence, and competence 
social. Competence lecturer showed from behavior lecturer in giving service education based on standard service 
education, independent, responsible answer, and develop ability by development knowledge and technology, as well 
as use the right strategies in the learning process. So that the lecturer in manage activity learning could succeed with 
maximum, then required competence or ability in arranging self-want to manage self with find tactics and techniques 
specified in the learning process so that makes it easy in the learning process teaching. With competence possessed so 
lecturer will arrange self, manage self, and move toward independence. Characteristic competence lecturers must 
permanently maintain and improved in skeleton support quality education.

Based on table 5 is known significance score for the effect of X1, and X2 by simultaneous to Y is 0.000 <0.05, and the 
value of F 128.668 > F table 3.06, so the variable emotional of intelligence (X1), and competence (X2) have an effect 
by simultaneous to variable performance (Y) which means hypothesis accepted. 
 
5.4. Discussion 
Based on the results of testing by statistics could see that variable intelligence of emotional and competence have a 
positive effect and are significant to variable performance. The effect given independent variable to the character is 
positive, the meaning is the higher intelligence of emotional variable and competence so the higher the performance. 
Based on the results of t-test is showing that intelligence of emotional and competence has a positive effect to 
performance so that hypothesis accepted. This is caused lecturers at Bina Darma University feel convinced that they 
have good performance. From the result analysis, this show that there is a difference in performance lecturer who has 
intelligence emotional and competence show more performance good from fewer other employees capable control 
emotional. This is appropriate with research conducted by Dodi R, Setiawan (2009). A possible explanation is given 
from results analysis this is intelligence emotional someone is very instrumental important in performance because 
when emotionally disturbed so activity will be disturbed. Research results in this implementation for companies that 
individuals who have intelligence for arranging emotions will produce a good performance. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The conclusion of this study is as follows 1) emotional intelligence (X1) has a strong influence on lecturer performance, 
the results of the questionnaire also support that there is a relationship between emotional intelligence and lecturer 
performance. It can be seen that Bina Darma University lecturers try to work together, which is related to one 
component of emotional intelligence. namely social skills. 2) The influence of the competence variable (X2) which 
has a significant effect on lecturer performance (Y) from the magnitude of competence on performance. 3) The 
variables of emotional intelligence and competence simultaneously have a significant influence on the performance 
of lecturers at the Bina Darma University in Palembang. These results indicate that a change in emotional intelligence 
and competence will also be changed lecturer performance.

Abstract 
The banking industry plays a very important role as a driving force for a country’s economy, including in Indonesia. 
This research was carried out to test the influence of Corporate Governance Mechanism on Financial Performance 
in the state-owned banks on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2010-2020. This research used a quantitative 
approach with panel data regression analysis method. The independent variables in this study are Board of Directors, 
Remuneration Committee, and Risk Monitoring Committee. While the dependent variable in this study is financial 
performance (ROA). The results showed that simultaneously Board of Directors, Remuneration Committee, and 
Risk Monitoring Committee had a significant effect on Financial Performance.  Partially, Remuneration Committee, 
and Risk Monitoring Committee have no effect on Financial Performance, while Board of Directorshas a goodimpact 
on financial performance.

1. Introduction
Based on the constitution Number 7 of 1992 about Banking, the role of bank which states that the purpose of 
Indonesian banking is to support the implementation of national development in order to increase equity, economic 
growth, and national stability in order to improve people's welfare. According to Sunarsip (2003) in (Bachtiar, 2019), 
in developing countries, such as Indonesia, the existence of the banking industry is becoming increasingly important 
because of the saving-investment gap that cannot be overcome by the government budget. The involvement of banks 
in collecting and redistributing public funds will greatly assist the process of economic development. 
Besides being able to be an important role in supporting national development, the profits generated by banks, 
especially state-owned banks, also contribute to state revenues in the form of taxes, dividends, and Non-Tax State 
Revenue. The following is an image showing the contribution of State-Owned Enterprises to national revenues in 
2010-2020.

The Effect of Risk Monitoring Committee on Financial Performance 
Based on Table 5 shows that the probability value of risk monitoring committee is 0.5318, it bigger than 0.05, so it 
can be concluded that risk monitoring committe partially have no significant influence on financial performance in 
state-owned banks sub-sector companies recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) period 2010-2020. 
The result shows that the results of this study are not in line with the results of research (Zulfikar, 2021)which states 
that the risk monitoring committee has a significant effect on financial performance. While the results of the study are 
in line with research (Tulung et al., 2020) which states that the number of the Risk Monitoring Committee does not 
affect financial performance so that companies must pay more attention to the competence, skills and professionalism 
of each Risk Monitoring Committee. 
5. Conclusion
This study analyzes the effect of board of director, remuneration committee, and risk monitoring committee on the 
financial performance of state-owned banks recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2010-2020. The 
results found in this study are that board of director, remuneration committee, and risk monitoring committee 
simultaneously have a impact on the financial performance of the state-owned banks recorded on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange in 2010-2020, while partially remuneration committee and risk monitoring committee have no effect on 
financial performance, but the board of directors has a impact on financial performance. This research is anticipated 
to add to the existing literature. The authors suggest the next research to to add other sample of banks that not used in 
the study. Next researchers can add or replace the proxy of the Good Corporate Governance variable with the proxy 
of the corporate governance committee and replace the proxy of financial performance using Return Of  Equity (ROE). 
And next research can use the same independent variable proxy and dependent variable proxy by conducting research 
on another company industry. For the company, the results of this study can be a consideration for the implementation 
Good Corporate Governance there must be a board of directors, remuneration committee, and a risk monitoring 
committee so that the company can run well and improve the company's financial performance or ROA. For investors, 
should pay more attention to company’s good corporate governance when they want to invest in a company. Because 
the better the implementation of corporate governance, the better the management performance, thereby preventing 
financial performance from deteriorating.

Abstract 
In recent times, the private and public sectors are facing the challenges of sustainable development (SD), especially 
since the adoption of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In 
this context, higher education institutions (HEIs) with one of their core activity, namely education, have a significant 
economic, environmental, and societal impact. Especially in today's knowledge society a workforce, capable of 
shaping and adapting to the green and digital transition, is needed. Two significant higher education outcomes are 1) 
students’ knowledge, skills, and competences, and2) their employability. Therefore, HEIs have the responsibility to 
deliver ""employable"" graduates, i.e., to educate them thoroughly and equip them with a set of 21st-century skills and 
competences. Extensive research on the impact of sustainability competence on employability has already shown 
that improved sustainability competences of students enhance their employ ability. Literature also shows that there 
is a worrying deficit of sustainability literacy in undergraduate students in general. Consequently, extensive 
adaptation and incorporating sustainability competences into IEM curricula in HEIs are still lacking. The transition 
towards SD demands a variety of complex and trans disciplinary adaptations in IEM education based on evidence-
based competence profiles. For these reasons, sustainability fundamentals should be part of the future IEM 
graduate’s life, because they play a critical role since IEM graduates foster social and economic development 
through innovation and technology applications. Thus, there is a need to improve and respectively realign IEM 
education by holistically incorporating SD principles, methods, and tools. In this paper, a methodological approach 
for the derivation of learning objectives to foster the development of sustainability competences of IEM students is

Abstract 
A multitude of European strategic development papers and policies highlight the importance of equipping people 
with 21st-century skills (e.g., the paper “Towards a sustainable Europe by 2030”, the European Pillar of Social 
Rights Action Plan, the industrial strategy for Europe and the small and medium enterprise (SME) strategy, the 
Commission Recommendation on Effective Active Support to Employment (EASE), and the European Education 
Area). The main goal is to enhance skills and competences mainly in the areas of circular economy and 
digitalization. Therefore, to foster further economic development and competitiveness in Austria, adaptations in 
higher education towards green and digital transition are needed. Furthermore, given the important role that 
industrial engineering and management (IEM) graduates play in the economic, societal, and environmental 
development of society, through innovations and technology applications, a special focus should be placed on the 
up-to-date education of IEM students. In this paper, the requirements for future IEM graduates were surveyed within 
the framework of the Austrian IEM study. The job profile study is conducted by the Austrian Association of 
Industrial Engineering and Management (WING) every four years to identify trends and developments in the IEM 
discipline. Thus, a transparent insight into the educational content and training opportunities and the possible 
occupational fields and functions should be ensured. The results can be used as a starting point for potential 
professionalization efforts. For the methodological approach in this study, both secondary data research and primary 
data from a questionnaire survey were combined to be able to incorporate literature-based findings and empirically 
collected data into a future competence profile. As part of the secondary data analysis, all Austrian higher education

Abstract 
The company's goal is to generate optimal profits to maintain the continuity of its business activities. Companies use 
various methods to make a profit, such as implementing a green business revolution which is also an effort to 
encourage achieving a sustainable economy. The company adopted a green business strategy due to increased 
environmental awareness among stakeholders who directed the company to innovate the green business in order to 
have a competitive advantage and produce good financial performance. The purpose of this study is to test factors 
that are suspected to affect the company's financial performance in the green business side in the manufacturing 
industry listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2019-2020 period using sampling criteria, a sample of 106 
observational data from 53 companies was obtained. The observation data were analyzed with descriptive statistics 
and regression of panel data. The results showed that only environmental performance affects financial performance 
because companies in the manufacturing industry can sustainably manage their operating activities so as to be able 
to obtain optimal profits. The novelty of this study is the empirical finding that environmental performance is able to 
encourage the financial performance of the manufacturing industry that went public on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange. Recommendations for company management to innovate in improving green business strategies 
combined with their primary business strategies in obtaining financial returns. It is recommended that subsequent 
researchers re-examine this study's variables in different sectors.

1. Introduction
The company's financial performance is the center of investor attention because it reflects the level of the company's 
ability to generate profits and prospects for the sustainability of the company's operations. According to 
Kartadjumena and Rodgers (2019); Shabbir and Wisdom, (2020)financial performance is the foundation for the 
sustainability of the company's activities because the company is considered to have been able to generate optimal 
profits, so investors are interested in investing. High financial performance targets encourage various company 
strategies to increase profits and pay attention to environmental conditions and the surrounding community (Okafor 
2018). On the other hand, some industries tend to exploit resources for profit, so the broad pattern of economic 
growth brings severe environmental problems (Wardhani and Rahadian 2021). The economic growth of a country, 
especially Indonesia, is due to the increase in operating activities carried out by various industries, causing various 
forms of pollution (Deswanto and Siregar 2018). The problems caused by this are becoming more severe so that the 
public and investors are more conservative about the importance of environmental sustainability and economic 
development (Ullah Khan et al. 2021).The achievement of the company's goal to produce good financial 
performance needs to be balanced with an increase in environmental awareness among stakeholders because they 
are policy makers so that the company not only focuses on profit, but also pays attention to environmental 
conditions by innovating green businesses (Indriastuti et al. 2021). 
The manufacturing industry in Indonesia is an industry that changes the landscape and negatively affects the 
survival of the surrounding community from the waste produced (Nr and Yurniwati 2018).  Observation data of 
manufacturing companies that went public on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and listed in proper of the

Abstract 
The IFRS standard has often been regarded as the solution to tackling international accounting challenges and 
eliminating differences. Many nations including Indonesia, have converged and adopted IFRS to their national 
accounting standard in hopes that businesses can compete better in the global market, especially for SMEs. Despite 
their long presence (since 2012), the optimal results of IFRS in SMEs have yet to be seen. The hypothesis on why this 
happened is that many SME’s have not been able to implement the standard. This study seeks to identify the reason 
why optimal results from the IFRS in SMEs is hindered, by taking on an empirical approach using surveys and 
interviews involving business owners as well as SMEs around the area to understand the usage and relevancy of IFRS 
in their operations. Subsequently, providing a realistic view on the development and implementation rate of IFRS in 
SME’s located in Palembang, South Sumatera. Systematic literature reviews from relevant journals and articles were 
conducted in order to explore what it means to implement IFRS effectively alongside the barriers and challenges it 
brings. The results of this study hope to serve as a contribution to data collection and other research, as well as 
display the realistic state of SMEs in Palembang to the government, while acting as a filter for potential SMEs to 
enter the global market.

problems faced by SMEs, limited capital occupies the main position (Abe and Batsaikhan 2015; Williams et al. 2013). 
Accounting plays an important role in the management of funds because funding is so important in business. Where 
accounting acts as a business tool that SMEs must understand and implement (Damak-Ayadi et al. 2020). Without 
it, the company would be unable to determine its performance. Furthermore, without accounting, the financial 
statements that are essential for funding will not exist.  
 
According to Sriyono et al. (2021), investors require financial information to assess and consider the performance of 
the business into which they are investing; this is necessary to facilitate access to credit from the government, banks, 
and creditors. The low quality of financial reports will result in SMEs being unable to obtain adequate borrowing or 
funding (Sánchez-Ballesta & Yagüe  2021). By applying IFRS to financial reports, the financial reports produced will 
be of high quality and transparent, allowing them to be compared throughout the period. Furthermore, financial 
statements prepared in accordance with IFRS are produced at a lower cost than the benefits obtained by its users. 
This IFRS makes it available to global capital market investors and other stakeholders (Setiajatnika et al.  2019), 
allowing the business funding pool to grow due to the increased availability of funds from various global investors. 
 
According to Pacter (2017), the use of IFRS has reached 150 countries, consisting of 44 countries in Europe, 23 
countries in Africa, 13 countries in the Middle East, 33 countries in Asia and 37 countries in America. This makes IFRS 
accepted as the global language of world accounting standards. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, especially in Palembang, 
South Sumatra, as the research location, it shows that the level of implementation of IFRS in SMEs is still at a very 
early stage. Even though the implementation of IFRS is already over a decade old (see figure 5), it still needs a lot of 
socialization and awareness of the importance of implementing IFRS, starting with the implementation of good and 
correct financial statements according to PSAK SME standards. The data obtained from the following survey results 
show that awareness of the importance of being big and doing business internationally is not an important part. 
Some of the obstacles and the main reasons that were observed were: (1) IFRS was not understood; this was the 
main reason because it was still difficult to make transaction records and financial reports. (2) The main barrier is 
mastery of foreign languages, particularly English. The main obstacle (3) is not understanding and not considering 
the importance of IFRS for business progress. The obstacles in terms of funds and not wanting to expand their 
business internationally are common. 
 
 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research has utilized and examined data from a variety of relevant journals and open surveys of SMEs actors. 
According to the acquired indicators, the implementation of IFRS in SMEs is practically nonexistent. This is due to 
the absence of financial reporting in micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs' lack of 
fundamental knowledge of financial standards and reports. If we were to determine the level of IFRS 
implementation, we can conclude that, from 2012 to the present day, the development of IFRS in MSMEs has not 
increased nor is optimal. Obviously, this is not a matter to be handled lightly. This study resulted in important 
implications and contribution for academics, realization of practice, and policy. From which is conferred that it is due 
time for the government to pay genuine attention to the actual state of SMEs. This study discovered that financial 
reports are important not only as a means of controlling and monitoring businesses but also as a means of achieving 
greater objectives, such as the ability to use IFRS in their business to compete in global markets.  
 
In addition, this research cannot emphasize enough the significance of being aware of your business as a whole and 
paying attention to the circumstances and demands. On the basis of its conclusions, this paper can assist the

Abstract 
Earnings quality is the ability of earnings to describe the actual state of the company's profits, able to estimate future 
profits, and as a review when making decisions. There is several factors that affect earnings quality, namely board 
diversity (presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of members of 
the board of directors, proportion of independent commissioners) and audit quality. This study aims to determine how 
the influence of the presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of 
members of the board of directors, the proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality on earnings quality. 
This study uses quantitative methods. Non-financial State-Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
for the 2016-2020 period are the population in this study. There are 16 companies that are used as research samples 
through a purposive sampling method. In this study, panel data regression analysis was used as a data analysis method 
and used eviews 12 software. Results showed that the presence of female directors, the diversity of the age of the 
board of directors, the educational background of the members of the board of directors, the proportion of independent 
commissioners and the quality of the audit simultaneously affected earnings quality. Partially, the educational 
background of the board of directors and audit quality affect earnings quality, while the presence of female directors, 
the age diversity of the board of directors and the proportion of independent commissioners have no effect on earnings 
quality.

Table 8 shows that non-financial State-Owned Enterprises on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period 
there are 17 observations that have an above average audit quality relationship with below average earnings quality, 
while the number of observations that have a quality relationship above average audit with above average earnings 
quality as many as 29 observations. In addition, there are 6 observations that have audit quality below average with 
earnings quality below average and 26 observations that have a relationship between audit quality below average and 
earnings quality above average. Based on table 8, the highest correlation occurs between audit quality above average 
and earnings quality above average as many as 29 observations or 37% of all observations. This shows that 29 
observations have a high level of audit quality and have high earnings quality. This means that 46 companies audited 
by The Big 4 Public Accounting Firm have a larger number compared to 32 companies that are not audited by The 
Big Four Public Accounting Firm. Of the 46 companies, 29 (37%) have above-average earnings quality and 29 (37%) 
are higher than 17 (22%) with below-average earnings quality. Therefore, having a company audited by The Big Four 
Public Accounting Firm will affect the implementation of earnings quality in a company because it reduces 
discretionary accruals. Based on the partial test results in table 3, the audit quality variable has a significance value of 
0.0281 which is smaller than 0.05 so that audit quality affects earnings quality. 
 
Quality audits are needed to prevent earnings management from occurring. The existence of a qualified auditor will 
increase the possibility of detecting earnings management practices so as to reduce the tendency of company 
management to carry out earnings management which will reduce the quality of earnings. Therefore, the higher the 
audit quality, the better the company's earnings quality (Wijaya 2020). The results of this study are in line with the 
theory in the framework of thought and research conducted by Hartoko (2021) and Wijaya (2020) which states that 
audit quality affects earnings quality. This study shows that more companies use Public Accounting Firms that are 
affiliated with The Big Four Public Accounting Firms that have a good reputation and experience so they can detect 
financial reporting irregularities more proficiently. The regression coefficient (β) for the audit quality variable is 
negative on discretionary accruals, meaning that the higher the quality of the audit, the smaller the discretionary 
accruals. Small discretionary accruals indicate high earnings quality 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study aims to analyze the effect of the variables that affect earnings quality, namely the presence of female 
directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of members of the board of directors, 
proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality in non-financial State-Owned Enterprises listed on the 
Stock Exchange. Indonesian Securities 2016-2020. The sample in this study was 16 companies with a research period 
of 5 years and a total of 78 samples of data processed due to the presence of 2 samples which were outlier data so that 
they were removed during the data processing. This study uses Microsoft Excel 2019 and Eviews 12 in processing the 
data. Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, the following conclusions are obtained. 
 
Based on the results of panel data regression testing, it is known that simultaneously the independent variables, namely 
the presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of the board of 
directors, the proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality have an influence on the dependent variable, 
namely earnings quality. Based on the coefficient of determination obtained by 0.137102, it means that the variables 
of the presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of the board of 
directors, the proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality have the ability to explain earnings quality 
by 13.7% and the remaining 86.3% is explained by other variables outside of this study. 
Partial testing to find out each independent variable on the dependent variable, namely earnings quality, is as follows. 
a) The presence of female directors does not affect the quality of earnings in non-financial State-Owned 
Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. 
b) The age diversity of the board of directors has no effect on the earnings quality of non-financial State-
Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. 
c) The educational background of the directors affects the earnings quality of non-financial State-Owned 
Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. 
d) The proportion of independent commissioners has no effect on earnings quality in non-financial State-
Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period.

Abstract 
Nowadays, customers are increasingly demanding more from products in terms of quality, flexibility, and delivery 
performance, while the price may hardly change due to many competitors. These requirements create a certain pressure 
on individual companies if they would like to hold their own in the competitive environment. Due to the constantly 
changing requirements, it is important for companies to identify certain potentials at an early stage and to adjust 
production accordingly. In the area of production, sequence planning is an important optimization tool that can be 
used for different objectives. It forms the foundation for detailed planning in companies and specifies the sequence of 
products to be processed. This paper deals with the topic of sequence planning in flow shop production. In the context 
of this, production planning and control are first discussed, as well as the areas of application of sequence planning. 
Subsequently, the basic models and the currently used methods are explained in more detail. To be able to give an 
outlook on future research directions in this area, an investigation of several current publications is carried out at the 
end. The knowledge gained from this work is intended to provide a quick overview of sequence planning and its 
application in flow shop production systems.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, companies are faced with constantly growing demands to survive in the global competitive environment. 
In the recent past, new management concepts for production have been developed again and again. These concepts 
should make it possible to adapt production to the constantly increasing demands in the areas of time, efficiency, 
quality, and flexibility (Syska 2006). There are various approaches to be able to ensure this adaptation. One possibility 
is to reduce the number of employees in production, which is achieved through the increased use of robots and 
machines. However, this approach has a very high capital investment as a hurdle and can therefore not be implemented 
equally by all companies (Heger 2014). 
In this context, another option would be to increase the value added to the production process. According to Günther 
and Tempelmeier (2009), this can be achieved through various factors. Among other things, they deal with the factors 
of time, quality, and flexibility. The creation of a product runs through the entire company and passes through the 
areas of procurement, production, assembly, and distribution. The individual areas need a certain time to carry out 
their activities. If the lead time of this entire production route is now lower, a higher creation of value can be achieved 
with the available resources. This lead time can be influenced by various factors and depends on the individual areas. 
However, when reducing the lead time, attention should also be paid to the quality of the process and the final product. 
One factor that is becoming increasingly important is flexibility. From a strategic point of view, production systems 
should be adapted to long-term changes in the market. At the same time, it should be possible to respond to customer 
requirements and adapt the production program at short notice (Günther and Tempelmeier 2012). The task of 
operational production planning and control is to contribute to the exploitation of individual performance potentials. 
A subarea of this is sequence planning or detailed scheduling. This determines the sequence in which the orders are 
processed on the individual machines. This sequence has a major influence on various parameters such as capacity

5.2 Mixed integer linear programming models 
The second-largest cluster in our study has been involved in the creation of mixed-integer linear programming models. 
For some other publications such models were also made, but they are not included here, because the focus in these 
publications was on a different topic. The study of Fathollahi-Fard et al. (2021) aims aside the minimization of the 
total energy consumption which is related to production, also on maximizing the social factors like lost working days 
and job consumption.  
 
5.3 Ranking of dispatching rules 
In three of the 54 papers, dispatching rules are used in an attempt to meet various production requirements. Rolf et al. 
(2020) use a genetic algorithm to solve a hybrid flow shop scheduling problem by predefined dispatching rules at 
different points. They also show the difference between using a genetic algorithm to assign the dispatching rules and 
applying standard dispatching rules at the start.  
 
5.4 Decision support systems 
Ünal et al. (2020)developed an integer programming model for hybrid flow shops. Their model can be used in a variety 
of production systems that are organized as hybrid flow shops. Based on their proposed optimization model, they 
create a decision support system. Kong et al. (2020) guide their case study for sustainable production of hybrid flow-
shop scheduling.  
 
5.5 Frameworks 
Nahhas et al. (2021) propose an adaptive scheduling framework. They want to address scheduling problems by taking 
multi-objective optimality measures into account. The main goal of the proposed concept is to find a good balance 
between the quality of suggested solutions for a problem and the computational effort required to obtain them. 
 
5.6 Others 
All other categories summarized here contain only topics that appear once in the selected papers. This category 
includes, among others, the paper by Azab et al. (2021) which is about a machine-learning-assisted simulation 
approach. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The constantly increasing market pressure requires companies to constantly change and adapt to the market. Due to 
the changes that occur, good production planning and control is necessary In-house production planning and control 
form a part of production planning and control. A subarea of this is, in turn, sequence planning. Sequence planning 
determines the sequence in which orders are processed. It can also serve as the basis for detailed scheduling. This 
paper investigated sequencing problems in flow shop production systems. In this context, Johnson algorithm, 
simulated annealing (SA), and genetic algorithm (GA) were determined as the basic models. Moreover, by conducting 
a systematic literature review the authors identified a total of 54 state-of-the-art papers which were assigned to seven 
clusters, namely “algorithms”, “mixed-integer linear programming models”, “ranking of dispatching rules”, “decision 
support systems”, “frameworks,” and “others”. Nowadays, research is mainly concerned with heuristic methods since 
the results of these are often sufficient. Moreover, the increasing work performances of computer systems make the 
calculation of the different possibilities easier and faster. From an economic point of view, it is recommended to use 
priority rules for the first implementation phase if sequencing has not been done yet. If initial approaches are already 
available, it is recommended to deal with heuristics. There are different approaches, which are more recommendable 
depending on the objective are more recommendable. The research is already in a very good way with the heuristic 
procedures. This should be further explored in the future to make it easier for companies to use the algorithms and 
approaches they have designed.

Abstract 
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a very important role in the national economy, as well as the 
Go Digital 2024 program launched by the government. The Covid-19 pandemic factor that poses a big challenge for 
MSMEs to immediately digitize, plus the potential that is expected in the future from digitizing MSMEs.While the 
government is intensively socializing MSMEs for digitization, MSME actors in the food sector in Garut Regency 
still feel that they do not have sufficient knowledge and have difficulty understanding the benefits of using e-
commerce. This study bridges by integrating the two models to determine the factors that influence MSMEs to adopt 
e-commerce. To examine the factors that influence the adoption of e-commerce, the study was conducted by
collecting data from MSMEs in the food sector in Garut Regency using an online survey. The sample size is 130
MSME respondents who have adopted e-commerce. The data collected were analyzed using structural equation
modeling (SEM) and analyzed by LISREL. The results of this study indicate that usage behavior is significantly and
positively influenced by Behavioral Intention, E-commerce Knowledge, and Social Influence. In addition, this study
shows that behavioral intentions are not significantly influenced by Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy,
Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, Social Influence, Facilitating Condition, and E-commerce Knowledge. This study
is also expected to provide tangible benefits both theoretically and practically in effective e-commerce adoption.
Furthermore, the limitations of the study and suggestions for future research will be discussed further in the last
section.

1. Introduction
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises have an important and strategic role in national economic development. 
MSMEs have also been shown to be unaffected by the crisis. When the crisis hit in the 1997-1998 period, only 
MSMEs were able to stay strong (Sarwono 2015). During the Covid-19 pandemic, almost all economic sectors were 
affected, including MSMEs. This pandemic has resulted in disruption of supply and demand as well as supply chains 
so that the wheels of the economy in the MSME sector have stalled (Humas dan Advokasi Hukum Kementerian 
Koperasi dan UKM 2020). Facing the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic so that MSMEs can survive, one of 
them can be done by digitizing (Antara News 2021).  
The survey results from Google and Temasek noted that Indonesia's digital economy in 2025 is projected to be the 
largest in Southeast Asia with a transaction value of IDR 1,826 trillion. Meanwhile, the results of a Bank Indonesia 
survey in 2020 recorded the value of digital economic transactions through e-commerce to reach Rp. 253 trillion in 
2024 (Berita Satu 2021). One part of digitizing MSMEs is about the adoption of electronic commerce. Electronic 
commerce refers to the understanding of a study such as according to (Laudon and Traver 2017), ""E-commerce is 
the use of the internet and websites to conduct business transactions."".  
By looking at the fact, makes MSME actors need to immediately digitize.In this case, Garut Regency was chosen as 
the research location. First, MSMEs the food and beverage sector in Garut Regency, as a sector that has good 
enough potential for further development, is considered appropriate to be the object of this research. Second, Garut 
Regency has the fifth largest number of MSMEs in West Java Province (Dinas Koperasi dan Usaha Kecil 2021).

Abstract 
The presence of digitalization makes all activities carried out by individuals and companies easier because of the 
assistance of the latest technology. The whole world has been digitizing, and Indonesia has become one of the 
countries that have participated in digitizing. This made the government take one concrete step by creating the 
program named ‘Making Indonesia 4.0’ by choosing five priority sectors, including the textile, automotive, 
electronic, chemical, and food and beverage sectors. The result of the Indonesia Industry 4.0 Readiness Index (INDI 
4.0) survey shows that the readiness of an entrepreneur to adopt technology is at a value of 2.47, with the optimal 
value of 3.51 – 4.00. This is in contrast to data on E-wallet users in Indonesia, which tends to increase every year 
with an estimate of 202 million users by 2025. The purpose of this study is to find out about the factors that 
influence the adoption of the use of E-wallets for the food and beverage sector to an entrepreneur in Bandung using 
the UTAUT-2 model and the addition of the Trust Variable. Data was collected by conducting a field survey 
questionnaire completed by 385 participants. The study found that Performance Expectancy has no positive effect 
and has no significant effect on Intention Behavior. Effort Expectancy, Social Influence and Facilitating Condition 
has positive effect but has no significant effect on Intention Behavior. Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, Habit and 
Trust has positive and significant effect on Intention Behavior. This study also found Intention Behavior has positive 
and significant effect on Actual Use.

1. Introduction
Financial Technology, often known as Fintech, is a term derived from the words 'financial' and 'technology', and it 
refers to the technology used to improve financial products and services (Alam et al. 2021). One of the benefits of 
integrating Fintech can be seen in the increasing adoption of E-Wallets. According to FinTechasia.com (2021), in 
2020 the number of e-wallet transaction reached US$28 billion with a transaction volume of 1.7 million times. The 
total number of e-wallet users in 2020 is 63.6 million users. And there is a prediction of the addition of e-wallet 
users in 2025 as many as 202 million users.  
The government has made five priority sectors for digitization, including the textile, electronic, chemical, 
automotive, and food and beverage sectors, and is made it into the program called ‘Making Indonesia 4.0’.  
The Indonesia Industry 4.0 Readiness Index (INDI 4.0 2019) is a survey conducted to determine the level of 
readiness of an entrepreneur to carry out digital transformation. 
The results of the INDI 4.0 in 2019 for the Food and Beverage sector have a value of 2.47 which is at the mature 
readiness stage, which has not shown the optimal stage, namely the stage of implementation which is at an index 
value of 3.51 – 4.00. The results of this index are valid for three years, so the results from 2019 can be valid until 
2021. 
The problem with this study is that an increase in E-Wallet users is not in line with the INDI 4.0 results. In other 
words, the readiness of an entrepreneur to carry out digital transformation has not been at the optimal stage.

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
The study was conducted to see what factors influence the acceptance of the use of e-wallet towards an entrepreneur 
in food and beverage sector in Bandung City. This study uses the UTAUT2 model and the additional Trust variable. 
The results show that the variables in the UTAUT model namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social 
influence and facilitating condition do not significantly affect the intention of using the application. However, the 
variables in the UTAUT 2 model namely hedonic motivation, habit, price value have a significant effect on the 
intention to use e-wallet.  
 
The Trust variable as novelty from this study shows a positive and significant relationship to the intention to use, as 
for the intention behavior variable which shows a significant positive relationship to the actual use of the e-wallet.  
The results of this study are expected to provide benefits and contribute to the development of science, especially in 
the field of technology. Researcher hope that future researchers can use the different method tests, such as using 
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) or adding a moderating variable. In addition, the researcher hope for further 
researcher to conduct research on the object of research that different so that it can be varied in various industrial 
sectors and the results will support further research.

Abstract 
PT XYZ is an agribusiness company. PT XYZ produces organic vegetables, hydroponic vegetables, and many more. 
But unfortunately, PT XYZ sometimes can’t fulfill customer demands. This is due to one of the reasons for the poor 
layout of the packaging room facilities so that the productivity level is low. For this reason, it is necessary to change 
the layout of the packaging room facilities. The stages of the packaging process at PT XYZ are boxes containing 
vegetables entering the packaging room, sorting vegetables, weighing and putting vegetables into packaging, sealing 
and stamping the production code, and shipping vegetables. In redesigning the layout of the facility, it is necessary to 
calculate the number of workers using the Work Sampling method, design a new layout with an Activity Relationship 
Chart (ARC), then simulate it with ARENA Software. There are two alternative layouts with different calculation of 
worker needs and processing time. The first alternative with the addition of a worker and a total processing time of 19 
minutes 30 seconds is an alternative that is considered feasible by PT XYZ.

Abstract 
All countries are faced with various challenges in competing with other countries globally. Encouraging industries to 
increase their productivity is a significant challenge. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) through Multinational 
Enterprises (MNEs) is one of the important channels and a strong catalyst for achieving national economic 
development. This paper examines the technology gap's impact on domestic firms' labor productivity. This study uses 
a panel dataset of Indonesian Large and Medium Enterprises (LMEs) in 24 industries between 2010 and 2015. The 
fixed effect estimation method has been used with different model specifications. The results reveal a technology gap 
in which varying roles influence spillover depending on the industry being considered.

Abstract 
Tax Avoidance is a form of tax resistance actively practised by taxpayers to legally reduce the tax burden without 
violating the law by using accounting methods and techniques that take advantage of weaknesses (grey areas) in tax 
laws and regulations. Tax avoidance can occur because of the weakness of the tax collection system carried out by 
self-assessment. This research aims to analyze and examine the effect of Leverage, Profitability, Company Size, and 
Political Connection on Tax Avoidance at consumer goods sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
(IDX) for 2016-2020. The population in this study are consumer goods sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange (IDX) for the 2016-2020 period. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling and obtained 21 
companies in the consumer goods sector with an observation period of five years, so 105 samples were obtained in 
this study. The data analysis method in this study is panel data analysis with Eviews 12. The results of this study 
indicate that Leverage, Profitability, Company Size, and Political Connection simultaneously affect Tax Avoidance. 
Leverage, Company Size, and Political Connection affect Tax Avoidance, and Profitability partially does not affect 
Tax Avoidance.

1. Introduction
Based on Law Number 16 of 2019 concerning General Provisions and Tax Procedures (KUP). Tax is a mandatory 
contribution to the state-owned by an individual or entity. It is coercive based on the law without receiving direct 
compensation and used by the state for the most significant benefit of the people. Based on this statement, every citizen 
must set aside a portion of their income for development contributions because taxes increase national development. 
Mardiasmo (2019), the basis of justice with tax collection lies in the relationship between the people and the state. As 
a citizen, you must be aware of your obligation to pay taxes because taxes are the primary source of state revenue used 
to finance state expenditures. State development requires no small amount of funds and is trim through tax revenues; 
therefore, taxes are significant in national development, and as citizens of Indonesia, we must carry out our obligations 
by paying taxes. 
Axes as the primary source of state revenue were seen from the State Revenue and Expenditure Budget (APBN) 
originating from the Ministry of Finance, which is more than 70% of state revenues and financing from the tax sector. 
Taxes become the focus of government because they are the backbone of a country. 
The tax collection system in Indonesia applies a system called a self-assessment system. According to Mardiasmo 
(2019), the self-assessment system is a tax collection system that authorizes taxpayers to determine the amount of tax 
payable with the characteristics of (1) having the authority to determine the amount of tax owed to taxpayers and (2)

Company size has a value of 0.0001, where the value is smaller than the significance level of 0.05, so the decision 
was taken that Ha3 is accepted and H03 rejected, which means that partially company size has a negative effect on tax 
avoidance in the consumer goods sector companies for the period 2016-2020. The results are by the hypothesis that 
has been built previously by the researcher, which states that company size has a positive effect on tax avoidance. 
 
Effect of Political Connection on Tax Avoidance 
The political connection has a probability value of 0.0004, smaller than the significance level of 0.05, so it can be 
concluded that Ha4 is accepted and H04 is rejected, which means that partially the probability of influencing tax 
avoidance in consumer goods sector companies for the period 2016-2020. The results are by the hypothesis that has 
been built previously by the researcher, which states that political connection affects tax avoidance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research that has been carried out and supported by theory and previous research, the conclusion 
is that during the period of observation of tax avoidance, proxied by ETR; the value is still high. Leverage and company 
size have a positive effect on tax avoidance. In contrast, Profitability and political connections have a negative effect 
on tax avoidance.

Abstract 
The financial statements describe the results of the economic activities of an enterprise over a certain period and show 
how the management of the company performs its managerial responsibilities.Therefore, its financial statements have 
beneficial information for its users internally and externally.Thus, companies must submit their financial statements 
promptly to avoid losing the benefits they contain.This research aims to determine the impact of company size, 
institutional ownership, financial distress, and the application of IFRS on the timeliness of financial reporting by 
mining companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2017 and 2020, either partially or 
simultaneously.This study's population is the annual reports of mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange from 2017 to 2020.Purposive sampling was used in this study, which yielded 29 research samples in four 
years.This research uses the logistic regression analysis method using SPSS 26 software.This study found that firm 
size, institutional ownership, financial distress, and the simultaneous application of IFRS impact the timeliness of 
financial statement submission. If only partially, company size and institutional ownership positively impact financial 
statement submission timeliness, while implementing IFRS has a negative impact. Meanwhile, financial distressdoes 
not affect reporting timeliness.

Introduction
Business development in Indonesia is getting more complicated daily, with fierce competition accompanied by the 
rapid growth of the capital market. As a result, companies compete to develop and are widely known forgoing 
public.Companies going publicmust provide financial statements to the IDX and investors because the 
economicannouncements contain the necessary information (Wicaksono2021). Presenting each company's financial 
statements is one way in which companies can communicate the various information they have and the economic 
indicators of the company's resources and performance to multiple stakeholders.The company provides information 
about its financial results for a period, and the purpose of the financial statements is to provide information about the 
company's performance in carrying out its responsibilities (Setiawati et al, 2021). 
The timeliness of submitting financial statements will affect the length of time in deciding by its users. The longer the 
delivery time, the longer the time to decide. Therefore, financial statements must be presented on time, and it is hoped 
that the company will not delay financial reporting and not lose its function as a provider of information for its users. 
(Sanjaya and Wirawati 2016). Thus, the importance of timeliness in submitting financial statements for users of 
information in making investment decisions. The Financial Services Authority of the Republic of Indonesia (OJK) 
Number 29/PJOK.04/2016 concerning the Annual Report of Issuers or Public Companies regulates the deadline for 
submitting financial reports, which states that every public company must report an annual report to OJK no later than 
the end of the fourth month following the end of the fiscal year (Financial Services Authority, 2016).

and Wirama (2017), showing that the size of the company has a positive effect on the timeliness of the presentation 
of the company's financial statements. 
The Influence of Institutional Ownership on Timeliness of Financial Report Submission 
The results of this test follow the research hypothesis, which states that institutional ownership positively influences 
the timing of submitting financial statements. However, the ownership structure in a company will provide something 
different from a business management perspective.Individually owned companies are generally weaker in supervision 
than institutionally owned companies because institutions have better standards and human resources to oversee the 
business. In addition, leadership carried out by institutions encourages management to work better in showing its 
performance. This means that the greater the percentage of institutional ownership of a company's shares, the more 
accurately the company must submit its financial statements.The findings of this study support the conclusions of 
Welly Salipadang et al. (2017) and Darmawati and Noor (2018),who found that institutional ownership influences the 
timeliness with which financial reports are submitted. 
The Influence of Financial Distress on Timeliness of Financial Report Submission 
The results of this test indicate that financial distress has no effect on the accuracy of financial reporting or is not in 
line with the hypothesis in this study.Furthermore, the leverage ratio with the DER proxy has no effect because the 
leverage ratio cannot be used as a guide in determining the amount of financial statement disclosure obligations.These 
results follow research by Arniman Zebua, Selfie Gultom(2020),which states that the debt to equity ratio does not 
influence timeliness.This study also supports the current theoretical basis, arguing that the company's debt exceeds its 
existing capital, causing financial distress due to high liabilities. Research by (Ningsih et al. (2020)finds that DER 
does not affect the timeliness of submitting the company's financial statements. 
The Influence of IFRS Implementation on Timeliness of Financial Report Submission 
This follows the research hypothesis that the application of IFRS has a negative effect.With the results of this research, 
the authors have not found the same research related to the effect of the application of IFRS in a negative direction, 
but the theory which states that IFRS affects accuracy is supported by Fitria (2021), which states that the application 
of IFRS affects the timeliness of financial reporting.This study also supports the existing theoretical basis, which says 
that the complexity of IFRS and accounting procedures also lies in the difficulty of complying with detailed reporting, 
which results in delays in the submission of financial statements. This is supported by research conducted bySucipto 
and Noor(2019);the application of IFRS influences the timely submission of financial statements. 
6.
Conclusion
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of independent variables, the size of the company, institutional 
ownership, financial distress, and the application of IFRS, on the variable dependent on the timeliness of the 
presentation of financial statements. The author's research subjects are mining companies listed on the IDX from 2017 
to 2020. The sample in this study was 29 companies for four years, so the total model in this study was 116 companies. 
Based on the findings of analyses and tests conducted using Microsoft Excel 2013 and SPSS version 26.0, it is possible 
to conclude that the size of the company, institutional ownership, financial distress, and IFRS application all impact 
the timeliness of financial statements presentation. Therefore, for the 2017-2020 period, the company size variable 
positively affects the timeliness of financial reporting for mining companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. 
Furthermore, for the period 2017-2020, the variable of institutional shareholding has a positive effect on the timeliness 
of the presentation of the financial statements of the mining companies listed on the IDX. In addition, for the period 
2017-2020, the economic distress variable does not affect the timeliness of the presentation of financial statements for 
mining companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. On the other hand, the IFRS implementation variable 
negatively affects the timeliness of financial statement presentation for companies listed on the IDX for the mining 
sector for the 2017-2020 period.

1. Introduction
In this democratic country, the existence of the Indonesian National Police (POLRI) is very much needed as a law 
enforcer whose task is to maintain public security and order, protection and public services. In addition, the National 
Police is also needed as a community builder in the awareness of laws and regulations, which is one of the main 
functions of the Indonesian National Police. This function can be regarded as a pre-emptive function as an approach 
to the community by conducting Community Policing. The concept of Community Policing itself is a collaboration 
between the police and the community which places the community not only as an object of guidance, but also as 
the subject of implementing it to create participation and remind awareness. law. In addition, there are also functions 
in the preventive field which are carried out with professional abilities such as patrols and escorts and functions in 
the repressive field which provide the National Police to carry out non-Justisiil repressive actions that contain 
substance on how to conduct investigations, investigations and criminal acts. 
The need for maximum handling and prevention from the National Police must be supported by various kinds of 
training as a supporting element in order to produce superior and integrity Police human resources. According to 
Chaerudin (2019) ""Any training program if carried out effectively and efficiently, will be able to improve employee 
performance. So that it can improve the work ethic of employees, and in the end can boost the potential of the 
organization ""through this explanation, it can be said that training for members of the National Police can directly 
strengthen members in carrying out the tasks and functions that have been given, for that members must always take 
advantage of and maximize training programs in order to gain knowledge and useful results for the performance of 
each member. 
The competence of Polri members can also be one of the factors in the good performance of human resources which 
can be said as the capacity of knowledge, skills and power in doing something that is produced by the learning 
process. According to Pianda (2018) knowledge and skill competencies are easy to develop with training programs 
to increase the level of human resource capabilities. This is continuous with the trainings conducted by the Police 
themselves.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The suggestion for improvement that the writers can give is that it is better that the creation and compilation of data 
processing results can be written in more detail and explained clearly, so can be explained and IBM SPSS can 
provide a feature to calculate path analysis. 
5.4 Validation  
Based on the data processing that has been done, it can be said that the hypotheses carried out are appropriate or 
valid with the given hypotheses, either partially or simultaneously. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the research and discussion conducted about the influence of training and competence on the 
performance of Central Lombok Police personnel. The author has analyzed 208 respondents and then carried out 
data processing and hypothesis testing. So, the conclusions from the research that has been done are partially, 
training and competence have a significant influence on personnel performance. The direct effect of training on 
performance is 25.1% and the indirect effect of training on performance is 11.6% so that the total effect of training 
on overall performance is 36.7%. While the direct effect of competence on performance is 13.3% and the indirect 
effect of competence on performance is 11.6% so that the total influence of competence as a whole is 24.9% 
Simultaneously, training and competence have a significant effect on personnel performance. The magnitude of the 
influence of training and competence on personnel performance is 61.7% while the remaining 38.3% are other 
factors outside of training and competence at the Central Lombok Police.

Abstract 
Japan is famous for its industrial and technological advances until today, after the 1990s Japan had an economic 
collapse and monetary crisis. With this phenomenon, Japanese companies are reducing local employees for counting 
bankruptcy and have started recruiting overseas employees for cheaper wages. Overseas employees and workers 
are kenshūsei and jisshūsei which is a short temporary contract work system in a company in Japan. This system 
became a pull factor for employees in Indonesia, which became a new habitus in the 2000s. The employees who 
want to migrate to Japan refer to the factors of habitus and capital they have. The theory and concept of this study 
use Pierre Bourdieu on habitus and capital, as well as Nanang Martono on social change strategies. The conclusion 
of this research is a perspective on the habitus and capital of Indonesian employees who will leave for Japan.

1. Introduction
Japan is the country has meaning “the origin of the sun” or “the land of the rising sun” used to refer to Japan. 
Japanese society has a strong spirit and desire in any case, including in the world of work. In data from UNDP 
(United Nations Development Program), Japan entered the 17th rank worldwide with a per capita income of 
approximately $37.268, while Indonesia ranked with per capita income of about $10.053 in 2014. Progress factors in 
Japan are based on morals, ethics, culture, etc., that have existed since Nara period (710-794) (United Nations 
Development Programme 2018). 
The progress in Japanese industry that began in the Meiji era around 1868 until now has been in great demand by 
other countries such as the automotive industry, food, electronics, toys, and so forth. The development of Japanese

Bourdieu and Wacquant also pointed out, social agents are of course not particles, mechanically pushed and pulled 
by external forces: ‘They are, rather, bearers of capitals and, depending on their trajectory and on the position, they 
occupy in the ﬁeld by their endowment (volume and structure) in capital, they have a propensity to orient themselves 
actively either towards the conservation of the distribution of capital or towards the subversion of that distribution’ 
(Damsar&Indrayani, 2009). 
Based on data from JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization) in 2014, the number of Japanese companies listed 
in Indonesia there are 1449 companies. This number still grown up because Japanese enterprises or companies 
trusted Indonesian company and more important is what IKAPEKSI work on Japanese company. Alumni kenshūsei 
and jisshūsei will always recruited by Japanese companies and what more better things is alumni make their own 
company in the hope to cooperate or as a supplier of Japanese companies. These companies already understand what 
is needed by Japanese companies, such as speed, accuracy, tidiness, cleanliness, and so forth by Japanese cultural 
and business ethics. 
On Sunday, October 8th, 2017; IKAPEKSI INDONESIA held the 2nd Alumni Internship of Japan Magical 
Reunion, which is a meeting and celebrating with fellow friends, kōhai (juniors), senpai (seniors), sachō (directors), 
and sensei (lectures). In this opportunity also went with the agenda business matching, sharing business & 
networking, job fair, motivation & training of entrepreneurship, and business inspiration’s workshop at Grand 
Karawang Indah Hotel and Amaris Hotel (Kompas 2017). 
3. Conclusion
Indonesian employees or workers who works in Japan as recruiting by Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration 
with IMM Japan, they projected to be agents of new habitus for building industry and economy of Indonesia 
country. Before going to Japan, they get the training and knowledge by some agents from IKAPEKSI (Alumni 
Association of Kenshūsei Indonesia). Then they go to Japan as kenshūseiand jisshūsei, they must build and creating 
a competent labor for Indonesia in Japan. After three years, they will back to Indonesia as alumni kenshūseiand 
jisshūsei to be actors or agents that supply new habitats to prospective kenshūseiand jisshūsei. After return to 
Indonesia, they can join to IKAPEKSI to re-build industry and economy of Indonesia and preparing the candidates 
kenshūsei and jisshūsei to Japan. 
The kenshūsei and jisshūseialumni will be the sustainability of agents to continuing the prospective kenshūseiand 
jisshūseifor build and create a new habitus for them. The new habitus is a habit formed between culture, work ethics, 
science, Japanese work techniques, etc. The formation of new habitus from these agents can form like a snowball, 
building a good connection, and the results can share between Japan and Indonesia. This sustainable system must be 
supporting together, therefore Japan and Indonesia can developing the industry and economic for future and beyond.

Abstract 
The number of students who smoke cigarettes continues increase, in line with achievement industrial target of 
tobacco products. The aim of this study is to determine factors that cause students who do not smoke susceptible to 
smoking (SS) in the future. This information will direct tobacco control prevention programs. A cross-sectional 
survey data from 148 schools and 379 classrooms, total 9922 eligible students in grades 7-12. Simple and multiple 
logistic regression analyses were conducted to factor associated with SS among never smoking students. Descriptive 
statistics, and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported. There were 5863 students who do 
not smoke of whom 454 SS; girls 78.25% and 58% were grade 7-9. The students who; were boys (OR=1.55, 
p<0.001), thought  cigarettes not harmful (OR=3,79, p<0.001),  current use e-cigarettes (OR=3.62, p<0.001), current 
consumes shisha (OR=2.92, p<0.001), ever got free cigarette/ voucher (OR=2.46, p<0.001), thought safe to smoke 
only one or two years and quit (OR=2.12, p<0.001), have item of tobacco product (OR=1.8, p<0.001), exposed

1. Introduction
Globally smoking remains one of the most important risk factors for morbidity and premature death. One in six 
deaths in the world are related to non-communicable diseases caused by tobacco use. In 2019, it is estimated there 
are more than 1 billion current smokers globally, this will continue to increase over the next few decades (Reitsma et 
al. 2021; Jha and Peto 2014). 
In developing countries with stable population growth, number of tobacco users continues to increase even though 
prevalence trend is decrease significantly. This is in line with aggressive marketing efforts of tobacco industry 
(WHO, MPOWER 2008). If there are no prevention efforts, it is predicted that by 2030 tobacco will kill more than 
eight million people per year. The prediction is most of these deaths will occur in low- and middle-income countries 
that will have a relationship to economic and social development. The enormous health and economic consequences 
of the global tobacco epidemic, making tobacco control a clear and urgent public health priority (Mather CD, Loncar 
D 2006; Jha and Peto 2014).  
Global Youth Tobacco Survey data from 143 countries found there has been mixed progress in reducing prevalence 
of tobacco use in this age group. Important information obtained is that adolescents and young people are more 
susceptible to addiction than older age groups. Results study from 204 countries shows that in 2019 an estimated 
82.6% (82 1–83·1) of current smokers started smoking between ages of 14 and 25 years. In 95% of the observed

Abstract 
SMEs that have a competitive advantage can be seen from the ability to build consumer communities, especially 
agents and store partners. Speed of service, price, number of variants, product quality, and distribution range are the 
keys to the victory of SMEs in fierce competition. SMEs are proven to be tough if they are proven to be able to operate 
for a long period. This study aims to identify internal factors, external factors, and formulate alternative strategies for 
SME snacks. Researchers used a single holistic case study at UD Bintang Agung, which is a snack food SME that has 
been established for more than 10 years with an annual turnover of 3 billion rupiahs. The analysis used in this study 
includes Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE), External Factor Evaluation (EFE), Internal-External (IE) Matrix, SWOT 
Analysis, and determining strategic priorities using the Quantitative Strategy Planning Matrix (QSPM). The results of 
the IE Matrix show the company's position in the quadrant with recommendations for growth and development 
strategies. There are several alternative strategies based on SWOT analysis and the recommendation with the highest 
score is the importance of having a unit that focuses on HR development, from the recruitment, training, to placement 
phases. This is necessary so that the company works under the system so that the owner can focus on observing to see 
bigger opportunities.

Abstract 
The Job Shop scheduling problem is very widespread considering its utility in the industry. Several researchers have 
worked on this subject with the aim of optimizing work sequences.  
This case study provides an overview on genetic algorithms which present a real potential for solving this type of 
combinatorial problem of job shop scheduling problem. 
During this study, the application of this method will be done manually in order to understand the procedure and the 
process of executing programs based on genetic algorithms. 
It is a problem where the decision analysis must figure strongly along the process because of the numerous choices 
and allocations of jobs to machines at the right time, in a very specific order and over a given duration. This operation 
is done at the operational level and research must find an intelligent method to find the best and most optimal 
combination.

6. Results and Discussion  
 
- 
So the value that corresponds to the fitness function of the new parents is minimal. 
- 
We retain this solution which represents the most optimal sequence for manufacturing a product. 
- 
So the genetic algorithms give good results which are real and which optimize the problems classified as NP 
difficult. 
- 
Genetic algorithms are mainly based on randomness; the more we choose to start the iteration process by 
using random methods, the more we will cover the majority of solutions found in the search space and the 
more we increase the chances of get the global optimal solution. 
 
7. Conclusion  
This article details the work done by software and intelligent programs when finding the most optimal sequence in the 
case of the job shop scheduling problem in a manual way to understand the execution process, this work will allow 
researchers to move on to more complicated subjects, in particular the requirement of certain constraints in the case 
of the subject of job shop scheduling problem. 
Genetic algorithms allow us to feel closely the usefulness of mathematics and programming in everyday life.

Abstract 
With globalization of business, firms are sourcing, manufacturing, and distributing goods across the globe. These 
extended supply networks have long replenishment lead-times which often lead to substantial imbalances between 
the facilities where some facilities have excess inventories while others have lower than desired inventory levels. In 
this study, we first conduct a series of experiments to provide managerial insights on the deployment of supply 
routing tactics (diversion, expedite, and transshipment) under different exogenous operating conditions in terms of 
suppliers, network configurations and product types. Subsequently, we evaluate how incorporating carbon emission 
concerns would impact the deployment of these tactics. 
Keywords

condition has had an extreme impact on all businesses, including the rice commodity business. The competitive 
advantage of the commodity business lies in the company's ability to manage the supply chain. In addition, it is also 
proven that if they are proven to be able to operate for a long period. This study aims to identify internal factors, and 
external factors, and formulate alternative strategies for Rice Mill. Researchers used a single holistic case study at 
Djasa Bhakti Rice Mill, a rice mill that has been established for 40 years with a turnover of more than 5 billion rupiahs 
every year. The analysis used in this study includes Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE), External Factor Evaluation 
(EFE), Internal-External (IE) Matrix, SWOT Analysis, and determining strategic priorities using the Quantitative 
Strategy Planning Matrix (QSPM). The results of the IE Matrix show the company's position in the quadrant with 
recommendations on improving the supply chain with legal registration to obtain the project as an effective distribution 
channel during a pandemic.

Abstract 
Agriculture has always been the most crucial pioneer for developing countries. Providing clean, healthy, accessible 
food is becoming a compelling challenge for future farmers. Existing agricultural systems are under threat because 
of the climate crisis, increasing population, and migration to urban areas. Food security (FS) is one central 
transformation area to reach sustainable and resilient development. Consequently, in this paper, the main target is to 
create a comprehensive evaluation environment to detect the most critical enablers of FS in sustainable agri-food 
chains. The enablers are derived from literature and experts’ opinions to create an index for essential facilitators for 
the FS. A framework based-on fuzzy linguistic measures is presented. The 2-Tuple linguistic (2-TL) model is 
chosen to be used with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools. The 2-TL model is a linguistic-based 
analytical approach that can eliminate information loss during translation. Finally, a real case study is presented to 
determine the applicability of the suggested methodology and show the managerial implications.

1. Introduction
Agriculture has always been the most critical pioneer for developing countries. Providing clean, healthy, accessible 
food is becoming a compelling challenge for future farmers. Industrialization helped produce more food with less 
effort, yet the food transportation from rural areas to city centers and novel production facilities revealed another 
question about carbon gas emissions.  
Nowadays, the changing climate due to carbon gas emissions is affecting every country, and it is called a “climate 
crisis to attract attention and act immediately by creating public awareness. Yet, public awareness itself is not 
sufficient to create climate-resilient systems. For this purpose, a more comprehensive and holistic approach is 
needed. The government, farmers (industry), academicians, and the public should act collectively to obtain 
sustainable and resilient agri-food chains. Generating sustainable strategies and holistic actions is a powerful way to 
obtain more durable systems.  
As aforementioned, the existing agricultural systems are under threat because of the climate crisis, increasing 
population, and migration to urban areas. The problem is also addressed in United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) under “Zero Hunger (SDG2)”,“Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12)”, 
and “Climate Action (SDG13)” (McElwee et al. 2020). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
United Nations (FAO), “Food security (FS) exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access 
to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy

A Comprehensive Study on Electric Discharge Machining

MB.Kiran@sot.pdpu.ac.in 
Abstract 
Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) is an unconventional manufacturing process that would help make components 
made of hard-to-machine materials. EDM is capable of high degrees of accuracy. The only requirement is that the 
EDM process can be used with conductive material. EDM process can able to make components having complex 
geometries. An effort has been made in the current research work to study the different dimensions of EDM, such as 
materials that can be machined using EDM, machining parameters, process details, advantages, limitations, and 
directions for future works. 
Keywords 
Electric Discharge Machining, EDM, Un-conventional machining, Dry EDM, Spark erosion 
1. Introduction
Components used in Aerospace and Nuclear domains demand materials that have a high strength compared to their 
weight. But these materials are difficult to machine by conventional manufacturing techniques. Electric discharge 
machining (EDM) shapes components of difficult-to-machine material, such as tungsten or carbide. In 1770 Joseph 
Priestley discovered the ability of electric sparks to erode materials. EDM process was proposed in 1943 by B. R. 
Lazarenko and N. I. Lazarenko. Only electric sparks are used in metal removal, and cutting force is not used during 
the EDM process. In this way, the EDM process is different from conventional machining. In non-conventional 
processes, alternative energy sources such as sound, light, electrical chemical, and mechanical energy are used. 
Dielectric fluid is used during the EDM process as it improves the erosion of the workpiece. The process is capable 
of shaping any component that is made from electrically conductive materials. Another advantage of EDM is that 
complex geometry is possible on parts. The electrode is positioned at a small distance from the workpiece during the 
EDM process. The electrodes are set at a distance to initiate a spark that erodes the work and causes material removal 
by melting and vaporizing. Many researchers have been working for the last few decades to study machining 
parameters’ effect on process performance.  They have proposed schemes for enhancing the MRR and the quality or 
surface roughness during the shaping of the component. In 1970 CNC driven EDM came into practice. 
2. Literature review
EDM machine uses the following components: a. workpiece: Any conductive material is worked by EDM process; b. 
In EDM shape of the electrode will determine the shape of the cavity in the workpiece; c. Dielectric fluid: While 
performing the EDM process, the electrodes are kept in a dielectric fluid tank; d. servomotor would help maintain the 
constant distance between the electrodes, by proper tool feed; e. power supply AC from the mains is converted into 
DC supply for generating the electric sparks between the electrodes, and f. pulse generator: used for supplying electric 
pulses for a specific amount of time. 
EDM makes use of the erosion effects of electric spark on the electrode. Thus, the tool will be positioned at a small 
distance from the work during the process. In EDM, electric sparks will be created between two electrodes within the 
dielectric fluid, such as water or oil. The EDM process requires work must be a conductive material.  During the EDM 
process, electrical discharge not only melts the work material in small amounts but also vaporizes the metal. During 
EDM, every electric spark would remove 106-104 mm3. The exact process would be repeated approximately 10000 
times per second.

Conclusion 
EDM is a nonconventional manufacturing process. Many researchers have proposed slight modifications to the regular 
EDM process, such as Die sinking EDM, Wire-cut EDM process, Vibro-Rotary EDM process, Water-assisted EDM 
process, and Dry EDM process. The dry EDM process is environmentally friendly compared to the other variants of 
EDM processes. Much research is expected in the fields such as (i) improving MRR and surface finish, (ii) reducing 
tool wear rate, (iii) Exploring using EDM with new materials and electrodes, and (iv) optimizing the selection of the 
process variables.

Abstract 
Innovation and digital marketing are seen as the main strategies to encourage the achievement of 
tourism development. The form of innovation includes marketing promotion through digital 
media such as websites or social media. Apart from the marketing aspect, tourism management is 
also no less important to pay attention to in an effort to attract tourists. Better management of 
tourist destinations can increase tourist satisfaction which has an impact on the quality of the 
experience and the emergence of the desire to revise and recommend tourist destinations to 
others. Not only that, destination management is needed to be able to maintain the sustainability 
of tourist destinations managed through the development and application of technology, 
including digital marketing through social media. Poor management can reduce the 
competitiveness of tourist destinations and make tourists reluctant to visit again. The purpose of 
the study is to determine the role of digital marketing strategies tourist behavior in tourist 
destinations. With this research, it is hoped that it can be a reference for tourist destination 
managers in improving tourist behavior to visit their destinations and increasing their income.

The development of Indonesian tourism for the 2020-2024 period is directed by the vision of
""tourism and Indonesia's creative economy that is advanced, competitive, sustainable and
prioritizes local wisdom in realizing an advanced Indonesia that is sovereign, independent and
personality based on mutual cooperation"". One of the key words in this vision is the competitive
indonesian tourism. In fact, as explained in the Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Tourism and
Creative Economy/Tourism and Creative Economy Agency for 2020-2024, Indonesia's tourism
competitiveness is still not strong. The competitiveness of facilities and the competitiveness of
Indonesia's tourism business are still relatively lacking when compared to ASEAN countries
such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Indonesia's accessibility competitiveness is also
generally lacking. Meanwhile, an assessment based on the  Travel and Tourism Competitiveness
Index (TTCI) conducted by  the World Economic Forum (WEF), Indonesia's TTCI score in 2019
was 4.3 (four point three) and positioned Indonesia in 40th place out of 140 countries assessed.
Another challenge  is the decline in people's interest  in traveling. Agapa et. all. (2021) found that 
there was a decrease in people's interest in traveling, both before and after the pandemic. Lew et

With an integrated and updated system in real time, be it in the form of content, images, 
animations or videos or sounds, it will make it easier to promote tourism digitally. One side will 
pamper customers or tourists to find the desired places without the need to go to a travel agent 
anymore. And the business side will reduce operational costs, faster and more professionally and 
the information conveyed can be directly the whole world knows about it. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The use of digital marketing turned out to be able to revive the condition of tourism in Indonesia. 
The use of digital marketing in the industrial era of the digital economy plays a very important 
role in increasing tourism promotion. Digital marketing is a must because this generation is often 
used whether realized or not. Digital marketing applications that will be used include websites, 
social media, online advertising, web forums, mobile applications. Digital marketing in the 
future there will be an application that makes it easier forwan tours to travel with an automated 
system and the existence of multilingual. The use of digital marketing in the era of tourism will 
not only change the industrial paradigm, but also work, how to communicate, shop, transact, and 
lifestyle.  
 
The use of digital marketing in digital marketing helps increase the satisfaction and experience of 
tourists while participating in tourism tours. Tourist behavior will be formed so that the tourist 
trips carried out give a memorable impression to tourists. This can increase tourist destinations 
so that it can boost the country's economy.

Abstract 
This paper deals with the issue of smart textiles in the context of the principles of the circular economy a digital 
transformation. Applications of smart textiles can be found in a wide range of industries. One promising sector is 
undoubtedly healthcare, where they can be used to measure and monitor vital signs in the home or hospital care. 
Therefore, the devel-opment of the technology is of interest for many research works. The requirement in their 
development is to ensure longevity, durability, repairability, disposal while main-taining the principles of circular 
economy and sustainability. The paper explores the interconnection of three keywords, circular economy, smart 
textiles. The output of this paper is a review of the available literature. Linking domains are explored through an 
analysis of the available literature on linking and combining the two do-mains together. This results in a review of the 
available literature that meets the se-lected criteria. The criteria are further specified in the paper. Furthermore, the 
paper assesses the intersection of the domains and the possible impacts when considering and combining all three 
domains together into one complex domain.

Introduction and motivation
Digital transformation in healthcare is currently the subject of much research, but also of European strategies and 
policies. The process of digital transformation encompasses a wide range of areas, technologies and processes that are 
related to the delivery of care. The aim is to ensure the efficiency, accessibility and safety of the entire healthcare 
system. In this paper, we look in more detail at technologies that enable the acquisition of patient data using sensors 
that are part of so-called smart garments. And it is important to recognize the importance of this data in the whole 
process of digitalization.  
The new field of smart textiles is getting more and more attention, given the technological advances that have been 
quite visible in recent years. The smart textiles market is estimated to be valued at 2.3 billion in 2021. It is estimated 
that around 2026 this market will reach a value of 6.6 billion due to the large growth that has occurred in recent years. 
[1] By smart textiles, we can think of value-added textiles, which can be added functionality, in the form of electronic
components that can add another level of healthcare delivery, for example in the healthcare sector. In the case of smart
textiles, the focus should be on how they are produced and the materials used to ensure reusability and avoid
unnecessary waste. This opens up a lot of scope for manufacturing with high quality and durable materials. [2] The
circular economy is currently a highly debated topic. This is the name for a closed-loop economic system. The idea
behind this concept is that raw materials, components and products lose as little value as possible and can circulate.

Abstract 
All players, including generation companies as sellers and distribution companies as buyers, try to accurately forecast 
the electricity price to increase their benefits in the market. The players have been using various techniques to improve 
their forecasting accuracy because only a little modification can increase the profit significantly. Recently, the machine 
learning based techniques have been used for forecasting especially price forecasting. The Bi-directional Long-Short 
Term Memory (B-LSTM) network, as one of the advanced machine learning techniques, can accurately forecast the 
electricity price. In this paper, the Ontario electricity price data is analyzed firstly. The bad data is denoised and the 
refined data is used to train the network in the next step. In order to increase the accuracy of the process, the structure 
and parameters of the designed B-LSTM network are determined optimally. Finally, the designed network are tested 
in various scenarios both on working days and weekends. The ability of the designed network is investigated for 
hourly forecasting of the day ahead market especially for spike points prediction.

Abstract 
The power companies try to reduce the power generation cost to satisfy the costumers and increase the profit. For this 
purpose, various acts including energy management strategies, power loss reduction plans, efficiency increasing of 
the gird components, etc. have been done in the past. Currently, the integration of natural gas and electricity networks 
for simultaneous operation is one of the most effective approach. In the integrated networks, the natural gas and 
electricity are managed simultaneously, making it more beneficial for both suppliers and customers. In this paper, the 
supplied and demanded natural gas and electricity are managed simultaneously to reach more benefits from both 
technical and economic perspectives. The studied integrated network includes power plants, gas supplier, gas storage, 
water electrolyzer, fuel cell units, wind energy and hydrogen vehicles. A comprehensive investigation is carried out 
to optimal energy management in a modern integrated energy systems, the hydrogen vehicles, as a new transportation 
vehicle, is included in the system. Both natural gas and electricity demands are supplied optimally using the proposed 
optimization algorithm. The demand response programs are considered as the flexible loads to increase the system 
profits. The optimal operation problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming problem and is optimized 
using GAMS programming software. The proposed methodology is simulated in various scenarios and its robustness 
and effectiveness are discussed.

Abstract 
Recent advancements in supervised machine learning tools have proven their capability to act as 
accurate approximation surrogate models for complex the chemical production processes.  In this 
approach, complex unit models are replaced with surrogate models built from actual chemical 
plant Nevertheless, real data should be handled with caution as it isn’t devoid of missing points, 
outliers, and faulty measurement, and using them without pre-processing could lead to inaccurate 
prediction models. Moreover, it is well-known that ideal real data without any outliers is almost 
nonexistence. Hence, cleaning data from outliers is very important step in data-driven modeling 
development Therefore, in this study different machine learning outlier detection method are 
implemented and compared to clean actual plant data before they are introduced to the data-driven 
surrogate models. Outliers are observations that do not follow bulk pattern of the data points and 
are unlikely observation of data. it is worth mentioning that identifying outliers by simple 
inspection and visualizing data set is challenging. There are different methods that can be used to 
identify outliers some of these methods are based on univariate statistical methods (Interquartile 
Range Method) and the others are based on unsupervised machine learning methods (Local outlier 
Factor, Isolation Forest, and One Class Support Vector Machine) The performances of these outlier 
detection methods on understudy data sets, are evaluated using linear regression that is used to 
predict certain process variables. Results show that removing outliers using these outlier detection

Abstract 
Digital Transformation in the government sector continues to increase because it has become necessary for these 
organizations. Citizens also need easy and flexible government services in digital form. Changes in public services or 
coordination between departments from conventional to digital have a tangible impact on the organization in the 
government sector. These changes due to digital transformation are not easy to implement. The business process must 
follow applicable regulations because it is a standard rule in the government. Process mining is necessary to improve, 
evaluate and monitor business processes in the government sector and comply with the regulation. This study aims to 
discover the types, algorithms, process mining tools, and government sector research output. The literature review 
research on process mining in the government sector informs that the discovery type is the most used. In addition, this 
research suggests that process mining can improve existing frameworks or create a new ones considering that process 
mining techniques are very flexible and not limited to particular contexts or countries.

5.2.3 Process Mining is part of the framework.  
The Business Process model is complex and very dynamic. To answer the existing problems a combination of various 
technologies needs to be done(Kang et al.  2013). Process Mining analyzes processes at the Emergency Medical 
Assistance Center (SAMU) in France. Then the results of the data from Process Mining are processed with Discrete 
Event Simulation to assess process management. The results of the processed data are used to improve processes that 
are now more effective(Lamine et al.  2015).This study uses Process Mining with NLP pre-processing to process email 
data from an organization. From the processing results, we can find out an organization's internal operations post hoc 
manner. This research is expected to be used for a country's national security(Bicknell & Krebs  2021). 
Process Mining technique is used to create a business process compliance model (CRM) specifically for business 
processes carried out at a post-mortem. Process Mining is used to comply with relevant organizational rules, increasing 
the framework's performance. A case study was carried out on passport applications with three collaborating 
departments. The research shows the results of CRML and their relationship with BPMN 2.0.(González & Delgado 
2021). 
 
5.2.3.4  
Research on process mining continues to grow. The idea and concept of using event logs as a database is very rich in 
usage. Many inspirations from process mining can be developed to solve problems in the government sector (Delgado 
et al.  2020). Different data analysis is needed with the change of Enterprise Architecture to Entreprises Services 
Ecosystem. Process Mining is used for a big data analytic Framework in India. In the research on how Process Mining 
is used as one of the tools/modules of the framework. Process Mining techniques are used to find associations between 
related services, real-time conformance checking, and bottleneck detection(Shrivastava & Pal  2017).  
 
6. Conclusion 
Process Mining is beneficial for improving the quality of business processes in the government sector. In recent years 
Process Mining research in the government sector has continued to grow. In terms of data, the results of Process 
Mining research are not limited by country boundaries or the context in which they are used. 
Research in Process Mining in the government sector continues to grow, especially in the discovery sector. Algorithms 
and methodologies as a whole are sufficiently available so that process mining research in the government sector can 
be further explored. One way of exploration that can be done is to use process mining techniques to create new 
frameworks or refine existing frameworks tailored to the goals or needs of the organization. From the results of this 
study, it is recommended to create event log data that has been designed from the start according to the needs of the 
framework or use artificial intelligence techniques to process existing event logs.

Abstract 
Sustainability challenge remain a prevalent issue among the SMEs in South Africa. This implies that the survival of 
SMEs in South Africa after few years of existence is a challenge.  In order to promote the sustainability and operational 
efficiency of SMEs in South Africa, this study aims to develop a conceptual framework for the implementation of 
Quality Management System (QMS). Relevant literature was reviewed to get an insight into the significance and 
challenges faced by the SMEs in South Africa. The literature also indicated the feasibility for process improvement, 
profitability and sustainability if the SMEs adopts the culture of QMS. This led to the development of a conceptual 
quality management framework for implementation in SMEs. The framework incorporates the basic quality 
management system requirements with a focus on process efficiency and sustainability. It is simple and could easily 
be implemented or modified by the SMEs. 
Keywords: Conceptual framework, Process efficiency, QMS, SMEs, Sustainability 
1. Introduction
Customer satisfaction driven by good quality of products and services is the heartbeat of most businesses. Quality is 
important in both developed and developing businesses. SMEs can adopt QMS in their business in the early stages to 
improve growth and sustainability of the businesses. According to Sahoo and Yadav (2018) SMEs view quality 
management as a tedious and expensive exercise and therefore become reluctant to implement quality management 
practices. However, in this era of a competitive global market, SMEs need to implement strategic management tools 
to remain competitive. The implementation of QMS is one of the ways to do so. (Sahoo and Yadav 2018) and (Horvat, 
Moll and Weidner  2019) concur that there is a positive relationship between the implementation of TQM and 
organizational performance. 
Neo et al. (2020) conducted a study on QMS implementation in the South African SMEs and found that SMEs are 
significant to the development of the South African economy. Jayasundara et al. (2019) opine that this is true globally. 
SMEs require little start-up capital and generates revenue for both individuals and the government.  
The small enterprise development agency (SEDA) in SA is mandated to implement the government's small business 
strategy, design and implement a standard and common national delivery network for small enterprise development 
and integrate government-funded small enterprise support agencies across all tiers of government (SEDA  2016).

The framework is based on common fundamentals of the quality management requirements. 
Figure 1 demonstrates a conceptual framework that consists of five stages, namely the input, internal processes control, 
process output, measurement and evaluation of the output, identify opportunities for improvement, and implement the 
changes for improvement. In the input stage, the SME determines the needs and expectations of the relevant 
stakeholders, investors, owners, employees, community, suppliers and the local government. It is important to know 
and understand the requirements of the stakeholders to determine a way to meet their requirements. The second stage 
determines the internal control systems to be implemented. At this stage, the SME plans how to meet the requirements 
of its stakeholders, select the suitable quality management tools to use; in some cases, this can be a software program. 
They should also define the work processes and assign the roles and responsibilities to the relevant competent persons. 
It is also important to document the process where necessary, for instance the business objectives, who is responsible 
to meet the objective, how often and how will the objective be measured. The third stage is the desired control system 
output stage where the desired output is indicated.  Output of the process is measured and evaluated to identify 
opportunities for improvement. The last stage is to implement the changes for improvement and incorporate them into 
the control system. The presented frame is developed to enhance the adoption of QMS in SMEs. The framework is 
non- complex, and can be modified to any organization, specifically SMEs. 
 
4. Conclusion  
The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the implementation of Quality Management System 
(QMS) by the SMEs in South Africa. This was achieved with the review of relevant literature, which provided insights 
into the significance and challenges faced by the SMEs in South Africa and the feasibility of solving the identified 
challenges with a properly developed and implemented framework. This led to the development of a conceptual quality 
management framework for implementation in SMEs. The developed framework is simple and incorporates basic 
quality management system requirements with a focus on process efficiency and sustainability. Thus, it could easily 
be adopted by the SMEs. It is recommended that the SMEs adopt and modify the framework based on the peculiarities 
and business model. Future works can consider the performance evaluation of this framework using a specific SME 
as a case study.

Abstract 
Efficient transportation logistics of humanitarian supplies and service providers are a crucial success factor 
in preparing for the operations. The aftermath of a humanitarian crisis requires quicker responses to the 
affected people. The disaster response plan includes enormous transportation planning and logistics to move 
service personnel, and emergency freight to the affected region. Transportation models serve as critical 
decision-making tools to obtain the best possible resource allocation and cost optimization objectives to 
provide quick responses to a disaster situation. Based on an example case, the paper formulizes a multi-
objective transportation model to optimize the logistics cost of moving service personnel, and emergency 
freights for a long distance. The result shows the proposed models provide the delivery given the capacity 
constraints while reducing the costs.

1. Introduction
Natural and man-made disasters have devastating consequences for people worldwide, particularly those living in 
developing countries. In 2016 alone, there were 327 disaster events, of which 191 were natural disasters, and 136 were 
man-made disasters [1]. Man-made disasters such as war, civilian attacks, bombs, significant fires, explosions, and 
transportation (such as maritime and aviation) occur unexpectedly in various regions. More than 90% of the disaster- 
and crisis-affected people live in developing countries that usually cannot provide sufficient help themselves [2]. 
Among the affected countries, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of 
Congo need the most humanitarian services.   
Logistics operations such as procuring relief aid and transportation are essential in the humanitarian relief chain and 
account for around 80% of all disaster relief activities [3]. This paper presents the emergency freight and service 
personnel relocation model following the assumption that the humanitarian services have already started in an affected 
area. For the supplies and personnel allocation, a network of depots has been established, i.e., depot locations are 
already in place, and their distances and average travel costs are known. The demand for emergency equipment, relief 
item, and service personnel needed for humanitarian operations is known from experience. Humanitarian operations 
planning requires collaboration among service agents to allocate an appropriate number of service personnel and 
transportation of emergency goods to the service area faster. Selecting the transportation network, hub structure, and 
capacity constraints plays an important role in developing the model. The problem in consideration is a multi-objective 
transportation planning decision includes (i) minimizing freight transportation cost and (ii) the costs of service 
personnel allocation. Such optimization problems with multiple objectives can be solved by different approaches [4]. 
This paper focuses on the two primary objectives, transportation of emergency freight and relocation of service 
personnel for humanitarian services. After a brief literature review, the following section describes the transportation 
model. The next section is an application of a real scenario and interpretation. The computational result presents the 
cost optimization. A short discussion and future research recommendation conclude the paper.

After the model setup, the solution is analyzed by the Excel spreadsheet. An array of formulas is established that 
cycles through each combination of costs in the network and subjects the iterations to the quantity constraints listed 
above. Table 3 presents a screenshot example of this array – set for each transport services.

The MS Excel Solver is used to find the optimized value of transportation costs given the capacity constraint. The 
transporting quantities of all TUEs and service personnel from four ports are summarized in the above matrix and then 
multiplied by the corresponding transportation costs to obtain the total cost of relocating support staff and emergency 
freight. The aforementioned is the best combination of relief TUEs and support personnel transport and expenses. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Generally, in disaster management, the transportation of emergency freight and service personnel reallocation 
planning needs to be improved. Transportation models serve as critical decision-making tools for quick responses and 
bringing necessary supplies to a disaster region. This paper's transportation model has two primary operations 
objectives: transportation of humanitarian relief and supporting staff. The minimization of the transportation cost 
model identified the optimal quantity of TUEs and humanitarian support personnel to reallocate in the disaster area, 
given the capacity constraints at the supply source and intermediary hubs. The process includes four supply sources 
(ports of embarkations), intermediary debarkation hubs, and four regions as the destination. Among the intermediary 
hubs were two airports for support personnel and high-value cargo and three seaports of debarkation for TUE's 
supplies. The main reason to apply the transshipment model is that it may be cheaper to ship through intermediate or 
transient nodes before reaching the destination. The model is primarily to support the rebuilding of war-devastated 
regions. However, the model is easily adjustable to any humanitarian mission and disaster support operations. 
 
Further research could, e.g., include intermodal transportation considering the cost structure of the different modes. 
Another possible extension could be the requirements of capacity uncertainty in developing the distribution model for 
disaster situations and developing a more comprehensive humanitarian activity that incorporates several more tasks 
and delays.
