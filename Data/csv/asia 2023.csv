Abstract 
Motorcycles two-wheeled gasoline-powered with internal combustion engines (ICE) and resulting CO2 pollution are 
very large in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam.   The adoption of technology innovation in 
electric motorcycles (EM) can be utilized to achieve a target of the transport sector's zero emissions by 2050. The EM 
technology innovation provided transportation solutions that are environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and lower 
operating and maintenance costs. But, the adoption rate of EM  in Southeast Asia still needs to improve and faces 
challenges of adoption-diffusion problems, i.e., product, process, innovation, and business. The early adopter has 
inconvenience and anxiety about their daily mobility needs over long distances. The charging infrastructure and 
battery capacities are critical components for solving the problem. First, users with high mobility who drive beyond 
the maximum mileage, if they run out of power, will stop and wait a long time for the battery to be fully charged again. 
Second, the scenario is to increase the battery capacity to 2-3 times the usual capacity to increase the vehicle's mileage 
without recharging it during a trip. There is an example of a dilemma in making a business strategy. Will electric 
motorcycles fail to overtake two-wheeled gasoline-powered? Can we achieve a target for the transport sector's zero 
emissions by 2050? The intervention instruments used early supply chain integration to solve the challenges and 
problems of adopting Electric Motorcycles in Indonesia were conducted by the University Centre of Excellence 
for Electrical Energy Storage Technology, Universitas Sebelas Maret. We also promoted an equivalent annual cost 
(EAC) to compare the options between improving battery capacity and infrastructure of charging by considering the 
cost of owning, operating, and maintaining for an extended period of the electric motorcycle market. Comparing the 
three countries is needed to obtain comprehensive input for economies of scale in global market competition. We offer 
to assess an EM Ecosystem in Malaysia and Vietnam. The novelty of research that is expected from this research is 
developing an EAC model suitable for the electric motorcycle market in the Southeast Asian market. Thus, the 
research results can provide the option of strategies for designing the global competitiveness of the electric motorcycle 
market and helping Electric Motorcycles Overtake Two-wheeled Gasoline Powered in Southeast Asia.

Abstract 
Short-term supply agreements and quarterly pricing based on the log export price are dissuading investment into New 
Zealand's wood processing, perpetuating the commoditisation of the forest industry and concentrating market risk 
rather than encouraging adding value onshore and market diversification. Supply, demand, cost, and revenue 
uncertainties reduce business confidence and discourage investments. A long-term contract with price adjustment is 
not a zero-sum game. The transparent information, calculability, steadiness, and time for adjustments across the supply 
chains provide synergies and advantages for the strategic allies. To mitigate risks, long-term contracts with price 
adjustment clauses are frequently implemented in power generation, coal, nuclear, construction, and oil industries. 
This price adjustment method benefits commodity suppliers and buyers with steady product flow and long payback 
period capital investments. Beyond cost reduction and productivity, in these lean supply chains, risk mitigation is 
essential for the entire payback period. Usually, the allies take significant roles in each other's businesses and have a 
symmetric relationship. Therefore, they want to build long-term partnerships rather than realise one-time gains. That 
paper introduces the benefits of the abovementioned solution in decreasing risks and improving supply chain resilience 
and profitability for all parties.

Abstract 
Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) and predictive maintenance (PdM) are two critical issues in equipment health 
management (EHM). The former aims at identifying equipment conditions (healthy vs. poor) while the latter focuses 
on the prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) for key components. In reality, imbalanced datasets containing 
limited defective samples make precise FDD very challenging. In addition, the prediction of the RUL is difficult 
because of limited availability of true data. In this research, FDD and PdM are transformed into the prediction of 
probe’s core states and tip length. In particular, this research aims at accomplishing the following goals: (1) ensemble 
learning is used to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that significantly affect probe’s core states 
(classification) or tip length (regression). (2) A two-stage stacking architecture is applied to improve the predictive 
performances. (3) Oversampling schemes are adopted to handle imbalanced datasets and improve predictive 
performances in core states. Research findings demonstrate that vendor type, chip size, chip leads, cleaning depth, and 
cleaning touchdown are common KPIs in probe’s core state and tip length. Further, stacking architecture and 
oversampling can significantly improve the F measure by at least 10%.

Abstract 
This study aims to carry out purchase patterns using the Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm at 212 Mart 
Pekanbaru. As modern retail, 212 mart offers a wide selection of everyday things. Due to its proximity to other 
stores, 212 Mart is under pressure to maximize its chances of attracting and keeping customers. Every day, there 
are many transactions at 212 Mart. Data mining turns mountains of incompletely processed sales transaction data 
into knowledge that can be considered when making decisions. FP-Growth uses Association Rules and its 
algorithm to identify the data set that frequently co-occurs from the data set that generates consumer buying 
patterns. RapidMiner software is used to process the data, and 28 rules with more than 20% support and confidence 
more significant than 90% are produced. The outcomes of the association rules are utilized to choose which 
product proposals, product layouts, and promotional brochures should be replenished simultaneously.

Introduction 
Due to the competitive environment, businesses must work harder to improve their talents and potential to choose 
the best approach for attracting and keeping customers(Aziza 2022; R. J. Kuo, Lin, and Shih 2007; Nazaruddin and 
Sarbaini 2022; Purba, Hamzah, and Rizki 2022; Sarbaini, Saputri, and Muttakin 2022). One method is to take 
advantage of information technology. Existing data can be processed effectively to provide valuable information 
businesses can consider when making decisions. 212 Mart has numerous locations all around Indonesia. This store 
sells various food items, drinks, and other essentials. Products sold have guaranteed quality, reasonable prices with 
attractive promotional offers, kind customer service, and a welcoming environment for customers. 
Data mining is an innovative method of learning knowledge from massive data sets, and it may be used to guide 
decisions (Muhammad Rizki et al. 2020; Thurachon and Kreesuradej 2021; Wibowo and Jananto 2020). One of the 
techniques in data mining is FP-Growth for mining association rules in sizable data sets. Frequent Pattern Growth 
(FP-Growth) is used to identify datasets in a data collection that frequently occur together. When looking for often 
occurring item sets, the FP-Growth algorithm employs the idea of tree building. (Chailes and Hermawan 2020; R.-
J. Kuo, Gosumolo, and Zulvia 2019; R. Kuo et al. 2018).
Finding the necessary rules and patterns requires using the data mining concept in the large-scale data processing. 
This study will use data mining to analyse consumer purchasing trends at the Store utilizing transaction data and 
the FP-Growth Algorithm. Finding datasets that frequently exist in large data sets is the goal of data processing.

The store can do something in the form of improvements based on the association rules obtained in the form of 
improvements in the location or position of the products sold. Types of products Mouth care, body care, spice, 
noodles, mineral water, bread, candies, chocolate, laundry perfumes, snacks, milk, and biscuits are placed close to 
the basic need products. 
 
Types of products Mouth care, body care, seasoning, noodles, mineral water, bread, sweets, chocolate, fragrance 
products, snacks, milk, and biscuits are placed close to staple products to make it easier for customers to take the 
most sold products and increase sales for related products. Furthermore, a promotional brochure is recommended 
make based on the association rules. The determination of products on brochures is carried out based on the type 
of products that are most often purchased simultaneously. However, the products promoted are those that are less 
marketable than the types that are most often purchased simultaneously. 
 
1. CONCLUSION 
Data mining can help process sales transaction data in the amount of 33,337 transactions. The Association Rules 
process using the FP-Growth Algorithm produces association rules, which are combinations of products most often 
purchased simultaneously. The result of the association rules is in the form of 28 rules using RapidMiner software. 
 
Based on the results of the association rules, a proposal for layout improvement is recommended make, namely the 
types of products Mouth care, body care, Seasoning, Noodles, Mineral water, Bread, Sweets, chocolate, Fragrance 
Products, Snacks, Milk, Biscuits are approached with Staple Ingredients. The rules with the highest confidence are 
Biscuits, Milk, and Bread with Staples, with a confidence value of 93%. So, it is recommended to make a 
promotional brochure.

Abstract 
The Paris Agreement involves 195 countries, including Indonesia, that have signed the agreement to commit to 
reducing the number of carbon emissions that cause climate change. Under the agreement, Indonesia has committed 
to reducing around 29% to 41% of total carbon emissions by 2030 by environmentally friendly transition technology. 
The Minister of Industry has targeted a total national production for electric motorcycles in 2030 of 2 million vehicles. 
As a government effort to achieve this target, the government issued some subsidies and incentives policy. The policy 
is contained in Presidential Regulation Number 55 of 2019 concerning the Acceleration of the Battery-Based Electric 
Motor Vehicle Program for Road Transportation which is the highest policy basis and has resulted in several policies 
from the technical ministries under it. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of subsidy and incentive policies 
through a market projection model for electric motorcycles. Market projections are carried out using dynamic system 
modeling by the technology transition by considering 4 factors (users, manufacturers, infrastructure, authorities) which 
are believed to affect the willingness to consider (WTC) of the user to buy electric motorbikes. The model refers to 
Powertrain Technology Transition Market Agent Model (PTTMAM) and uses Powersim Studio 10 simulation 
software. This study simulates 19 subsidy and incentive policies in Indonesia, including 11 subsidy and incentive 
policies for manufacturers, 6 for users, and 2 for infrastructure providers. The results of the simulation show that 
market projections are believed to influence consumer considerations in purchasing electric motorcycle vehicles in 
Indonesia.

Abstract 
The current challenge to meet consumer demands to increase food production and maintain food security is becoming 
more complex due to climate change, land degradation, and the conversion of forests. The limited capacity of 
smallholder farmers as food producers is the suspicion of a shift in R&D priorities from agriculture to industry in 
Southeast Asia and other developing countries, followed by a widening gap in the absorption capacity of R&D. This 
path leads to severe threats to food security in most developing countries. Sustainable agriculture cannot be achieved 
only by consistent adherence to ecological principles. Agriculture should aim to provide economic benefits and 
incentivize farmers to stay in their current roles as critical actors in food production and innovation process.  
Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) attempted to support Thai and international investors and encourage them to 
invest in research and development in food industry.  The government expected that Agro-food industry will generate 
7% of GDP focusing on research and development and productivity improvement.  
This study aims to examine the current practices of agro-food innovations in Thailand, for developing new business 
models by addressing the challenges and exploiting the opportunities. Eight business experts and practitioners have 
been interviewed as the first step qualitative research to develop some understandings on the complexity of the current 
practices. The current practices in the Thailand agro-food industry have been examined from an innovation 
perspective, covering Initiation, Collaboration, Local Customization, Product Innovation, Process Innovation, 
Position Innovation, and Paradigm Innovation.  The thematic analysis indicates that Thailand's agriculture and food 
industries are dynamic and diverse, with opportunities for new products to target five distinctive food categories, 
namely mass market, premium, health and beauty, niche, and low cost. 
The emerging Information Technologies and the varied consumer demands have created opportunities for product 
innovation, echoed by investment capital and the emerging technologies with new start-ups in the food industry. For 
instance, the consumers have displayed their shifting trends in favor of time-saving, plant-based, and nutrition rich 
agro-food products.  However, the challenging issues remain in realizing the full potentials of the agro-food innovation 
in Thailand, which include but not limited to financial and quality infrastructural availabilities, cultural diversity and 
regulatory constrains, which consequently create considerable challenges for the collaborations between different 
businesses to developing new products. The challenges must be addressed for collaborations between the engaged 
parties which is imperative for agro-foods innovation.

Abstract 
This paper is a case study of an engineering and manufacturing company which designs, manufactures, and services 
equipment used in the extraction of petroleum and natural gas. The company faced the challenge of long lead time for 
its products. A study was undertaken for one of the products to reduce the lead time. Study involved mapping all 
processes from order receipt till dispatch that includes identification of Value Added and Non-Value-added processes 
/activities with recommendation for better utilization of available resources. Study included Process Mapping for 
Design, Procurement, Assembly, Painting and dispatch, Value Added and Non Value Added activities were identified, 
process Analysis was undertaken and Suggestions for improvements were made. It was observed that the company 
followed “Project Based Manufacturing” which made the critical path longer. There are only minor changes in design 
of most of the products. The analysis suggested the company to move from Project based manufacturing to Standard 
Product based manufacturing for the studied product which will improve the information flow and throughput time. 
Changing to “Standard Product” thus helped in eliminating some non-value-added processes. In order to keep the 
benefits for longer period and get sustained improvements, few more suggestions were given.

Abstract 
Maintaining a reliable electrical power network is crucial for the national economy, especially in a developing and 
motivated country. This can be achieved through optimal maintenance and operation (power generation and 
transmission) of the energy system, including generators and transmissions lines. Furthermore, uninterrupted power 
supply is essential for certain sectors such as hospitals or industrial zones. This research proposes a mathematical 
model that can be used to optimize the integrated problem of maintenance and operation of the energy system 
considering the sufficient power supply to critical units. The objectives are to minimize the total power deficits in the 
network and the total operation and maintenance cost, while ensuring a reliable power supply to critical units. A 
matheuristic is developed to deal with large-scale problems. This solution approach combines a genetic algorithm 
using elitism criteria and the relaxed mathematical model with bounding updates. IEEE data sets are used to test the 
mathematical model and the Matheuristic. The case study shows the effectiveness of the proposed matheuristic which
achieves 100% electrical demand fulfillment for critical units and reduces computational time by about 30%.

Abstract 
An inventory management affects carrying cost, ordering cost, and shortage cost.  So, success in business management 
must be considered the good inventory management system, especially the Small Medium Enterprise (SME).  The 
effective categorization of materials is also important to prioritize and optimize inventory management which the 
material disbursement in the warehouse system more efficient. In this study, the cause of the problems was analyzed 
by Fishbone Diagram. It was found the main cause of the ordering cost was because the inventory was unclassified. 
Then, the ABC Classification was used to classify the material product groups. For all groups (ABC) use the Economic 
Order Quantity model for order quantity planning.   After implementation, the total cost of group A was reduced by 
THB 128,737 per year. Group B was reduced by THB 76,982 per year and group C was reduced by THB 122,757 per 
year.

1. Introduction
Today's highly competitive business environment has forced businesses to adapt to survive by developing more 
efficient operations and reducing costs and responding to the needs of consumers by adopting strategies that 
appropriate, where each business has different strategies to decide according to each type of business.  
The purpose of this research is to improve, reduce costs in the work process, and increase the competitiveness of a 
case study company which is a manufacturer of various machinery that has a warehouse to store the used materials. It 
is used in the production of machinery as well as the consumables that are required to work from the operation. 
Inventory Management at present, the company faces the problem of inappropriate inventory due to the quantity of 
each purchase order resulting in a shortage of some items, as well as the problem of employees working with errors 
in correcting data. in the system (Enterprise Resource Planning: ERP) does not match reality, resulting in errors in 
inventory, affecting production due to insufficient materials for production often from various problems in inventory 
management, the researcher presents an analysis of inventory control by inventory segmentation method, material 
grouping system. ABC Classification system and finding the appropriate order quantity (Economic order quantity) to 
use with the case study company. By comparing the cost of ordering new materials with the cost of ordering old 
materials in the past to clearly know the cost that can be reduced. 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of this research is Analysis the cause of high ordering cost, ABC classification and apply Economic 
Order Quantity model for classified material and comparison of the ordering cost.

Figure 4. Comparison of current storage costs and EOQ 
 
Therefore, ordering with EOQ and ROP policies will cause total inventory costs to be less than the current policy of 
424,896 THB per year. In terms of current order quantity, Group A has an order quantity of 111 times/year, while in 
EOQ, Group A has reduced to 29 orders/year. 53 orders/year, while in the EOQ model, Group B orders 18 times/year, 
and finally, Group C materials are currently ordered 2,703 times/year, with the EOQ policy remaining 32 orders/year. 
When analyzing the total cost of storage in the three groups A, B and C as shown in Figure 4., it was found that the 
current procurement model has the total cost of storage equal to 86,979 THB, which is lower than the total cost of 
storage. Stored in EOQ form with a value of 153,649 THB, which is more valuable than the current form of storage 
of 66,670. THB due to the number of times in purchasing less, but the quantity of units increases, thus increasing the 
EOQ storage rate and thus increasing the cost of storage. However, this increases in storage costs. The proportion is 
much less than the reduced procurement costs. Thus, EOQ's overall inventory cost is still more cost-effective than 
purchasing with the current policy, showing the lowest total cost of inventory across the three groups A, B, and C. It 
was found that the current procurement model has a total cost of inventory equal to 686,702 THB, which is higher 
than the total cost of inventory from the EOQ procurement model that is equal to 328,476 THB. The cost is reduced 
by 358,266 THB per year from the policy. original purchase 
 
5. Conclusion  
A conclusion This research aims to improve and reduce inventory costs of a machinery manufacturing company. From 
the results of the study of the problem analysis from the fishbone, the researcher found the exact cause of the problem, 
which is the lack of a storage system to classify the material and the lack of quantification in the process. Order that

is a clear system. The researcher therefore came up with a solution and applied it to warehouse management. In the 
material prioritization model ABC and EOQ calculations to find the optimal order quantity by comparing current and 
post-adjusted inventory costs with the appropriate order quantity system. company case study using the data of orders 
throughout the year 2022, it was found that the value of inventory in the material item group A was 9 items, 
representing 63% of the total number of items, B was 9 items, representing 22%, and product group C has 30 items, 
representing 15%, so the researcher brought all 48 inventory items. come to find the appropriate order quantity to be 
used as a guideline for managing each type of material by calculating the appropriate order quantity and re-ordering 
points for each type of material.  
 
The researcher has calculated and compared the total inventory costs of Group A, Group B, and Group C. It was found 
that ordering in the EOQ format will have a lower total cost than ordering in the current form. The current model has 
a total cost of inventory of 686,702 THB, which is higher than the total cost of inventory of the EOQ order model, 
which is valued at 328,476 THB, which is 358,226 THB less. Because of the reduced cost of using the EOQ model, 
the volume of orders will increase from the current procurement model and reduce the frequency of orders, resulting 
in lower cost of purchase orders. followed by, at the same time, the inventory of the order from EOQ. 
 
There will be more materials stored suitable for use, not running out too quickly. When comparing the cost of 
increasing storage, it was found that it was worth the cost of reducing the purchase order from reducing the frequency 
of material purchases. Therefore, it can be concluded that the overall cost of inventory in the EOQ model used by the 
research has been presented to improve the factory warehouse to be more efficient in cost management than in the 
EOQ model. Management with current ordering patterns.

Abstract 
Pot-holes are a prevalent problem that affects the effective functioning of the road infrastructure. They cause a high 
number of road accidents, and vehicle damage, resulting in higher maintenance costs. Effective strategies are therefore 
required to report potholes to road maintenance authorities and thus facilitate constant upkeep and repair. This study 
focuses on the development of a deep-learning-based pothole detection and reporting system, to assist road 
maintenance personnel in making informed road repair decisions. A YOLOv5 model is developed and trained using 
a custom dataset containing pothole images obtained from a survey conducted by the researcher, as well as online 
sources. The model is integrated into the overall system, to facilitate the detection of potholes from uploaded images. 
Comprehensive data visualizations are created, with the location of detected potholes added to a map. Pothole 
maintenance procedures are implemented to ensure that the pothole information in the system is accurate and up to 
date. Overall, the system provides a clear and concise viewpoint from which road repair decisions can be made and 
justified.

1. Introduction
Good road infrastructure plays a critical role in the transportation system. It enables the efficient movement of people 
and access to a variety of commercial and social activities (Ng et al. 2019). However, maintenance of this road 
infrastructure proves challenging, with potholes becoming a major hindrance to the process. Over time, potholes 
increase in number and size, leading to unpleasant impacts on different road stakeholders. Premanand et al. (2020) 
state that these bowl-shaped road cavities cause a significant proportion of automobile-related accidents, either directly 
or indirectly. J et al. (2020) further allude that road maintenance processes are prone to human errors and consume a 
significant amount of time as they are conducted manually in most places. These factors have resulted in the 
establishment of road maintenance projects in recent years to assess the performance of road infrastructure, support 
investment plans, and emphasize upkeep and repair (Rana et al. 2022). 
Studies indicate that deep learning-based approaches have been used to detect potholes, with several researchers 
Srivastava et al. (2018), Rosli et al. (2022), and R et al. (2020) using map services to visually present these potholes 
to road maintenance authorities. However, identifying potholes and knowing their location does not provide sufficient 
information that road maintenance authorities need to make informed road repair decisions. Without further 
exploitation of other pothole information reporting and visualization strategies, challenges are faced in deciding which 
roads to prioritize fixing first and justifying the reason for that prioritization. This research, therefore, seeks to utilize 
deep-learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to add more versatility to the pothole reporting process, 
and thus provide a clearer standpoint from which road repair decisions can be made.

Figure 19. Pothole Maintenance Process 
When the actual maintenance work is completed on the ground, the users can then complete the maintenance process. 
This ensures that all potholes within the maintained region are removed from the system, thus updating the database, 
dashboards, and map. Figure 19. shows the task completion screen. Finally, an email notification is sent to all users, 
updating them on the changes on the visualization dashboards and the map. 
 
4.4 Proposed Improvements 
The output of the study was a web-based pothole detection and reporting system, with mobile responsiveness at its 
core, to support smaller mobile devices. However, not all system user interface components were able to achieve the 
required level of mobile responsiveness required. Hence future developments would be to build a mobile application 
tailored to perform the same functionalities as the web application. This would improve user interactivity and 
experience on smaller mobile devices. In future work in the system, batch processing and pothole detection can be 
implemented. This feature would allow users to upload a folder containing all pothole images collected from a region 
of interest. These would then be detected in the batch process, with results returned to the user when all processing is 
completed. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study presented a deep-learning-based pothole detection and reporting system that provides comprehensive data 
visualizations. The first objective of the study was achieved by creating a user interface feature to upload or capture 
an image. To capture additional information on potholes in the specified collection region, a questionnaire survey was 
implemented where system users could provide more context on the state of the road based on their perspective. The 
second objective was achieved by using a member of the YOLO family of algorithms (YOLOv5) to build a model to 
detect potholes. To make the trained model available to other system components, it was then embedded in a FASTAPI 
application and deployed to a cloud environment. 
The third and fourth objectives were successfully met. Before pothole detection, an image verification step was 
implemented, to check if the contained location information of where it was captured. If the information was available, 
the user would then submit their pothole detection request. Upon successful detection, the location metadata captured 
was used to add the detected potholes on a map. Visualization reports within the defined dashboards would then be 
updated accordingly. The fifth objective was also met as all registered system users were able to receive email 
notifications upon successful pothole detection. A pothole maintenance process was also implemented to ensure that 
the pothole information in the system portrayed an accurate view of the state of the road infrastructure. All these 
features led to the successful implementation of a system that supports informed road repair decision-making.

Abstract 
This research focuses on customer churn analytics in the banking sector of Zimbabwe, specifically investigating the 
effectiveness of classical machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. Customer churn, characterized by 
the loss of clients in the banking industry, has significant implications for banks, including revenue reduction, 
increased customer acquisition costs, and reputational damage. The study utilizes a dataset of customer data containing 
demographic and banking-related features to train and evaluate various models, including logistic regression, decision 
trees, random forests, XGBoost, and a basic deep learning algorithm. The findings reveal that all models exhibit high 
accuracy in predicting customer churn, with the deep learning model demonstrating superior performance compared 
to the classical algorithms. However, the study acknowledges limitations such as a small sample size and constrained 
feature set, which may impact the generalizability of the findings. The conclusion discusses the practical implications 
of the research for Zimbabwean banks and suggests potential avenues for future research to address the identified 
limitations and further enhance customer churn analytics in the banking sector.

Introduction 
Zimbabwe's banking industry plays a crucial role in the nation's economy by providing key financial services to 
citizens, companies, and the government. Masunda and Zivanai (2021) claim that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe 
(RBZ), which oversees overseeing the activities of banks and other financial institutions, regulates the sector. The 
dominance of a select few significant commercial banks, such as CBZ Bank, Standard Chartered Bank Zimbabwe, 
and the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, has led to the observation of a power concentration in Zimbabwe's financial 
sector (Matenda and Hapanyengwi 2021). The number of microfinance institutions, however, has grown recently to 
offer financial services to people and small enterprises who might not have access to standard banking services. 
The banking sector in Zimbabwe has encountered numerous challenges, such as hyperinflation, a shortage of foreign 
currency, and a decline in economic activity, all of which have impeded banks' lending capacity and contributed to an 
increase in non-performing loans. According to Chizema and Mawire (2021), the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) 
has undertaken several measures to address these issues, including the adoption of diverse currencies and the 
implementation of new regulations aimed at ensuring financial stability. These initiatives have been crucial in 
navigating the challenges faced by the banking sector and striving towards a more stable and sustainable financial 
environment in Zimbabwe. 
According to Farhan M, Asghar M. and Abbas Q. (2021). customer churn also known as customer attrition is the loss 
of customers by a business or organization. Customer churn, which occurs when clients stop using a bank's services 
or close their accounts, is a term used in the banking industry. Customer churn can have negative consequences on

1.1. Proposed Improvements 
To improve the performance of customer churn prediction models, several strategies can be considered. These include 
enhancing the feature set by incorporating more relevant variables, addressing class imbalance through data balancing 
techniques, fine-tuning model hyperparameters, exploring ensemble methods, incorporating time series analysis, 
utilizing advanced deep learning architectures, and ensuring robust model evaluation through cross-validation. By 
implementing these improvements, the models can achieve higher accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores, 
leading to more effective predictions of customer churn. 
 
Conclusion  
The four models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and deep learning are all 
machine learning techniques that can be used for classification tasks such as customer churn prediction. 
Classical machine learning models are often easier to interpret and require less computational power compared to deep 
learning models. Logistic Regression, for example, is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that works by 
modeling the probability of the outcome using a linear function. Decision Trees and Random Forest are non-parametric 
supervised learning algorithms that work by recursively partitioning the data based on the values of the features. 
XGBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting to improve model performance. 
On the other hand, deep learning models, such as neural networks, can handle complex and high-dimensional data and 
have been shown to outperform classical machine learning models in certain tasks, such as image and speech 
recognition. However, they require more computational power and can be more difficult to interpret compared to 
classical machine learning models.

Abstract 
Although technology is a primary input for productivity, it may be a burden to seek, acquire and adopt modern and 
expensive technology for firms in developing countries such as Vietnam. Management practices may substitute costly 
technology to improve labor productivity in the manufacturing sector. This study of 35 countries recognizes the strong 
positive correlation between labor productivity and management, merging the World Management Survey and 
Conference Board datasets. A closer analysis of 11,702 observations in the manufacturing sector shows that larger 
firms tend to use more management practices. A comparative analysis of adopting management practices indicates 
that Vietnam’s firms have lower mean management scores than high-income nations on average. In Vietnam, firms in 
the low-tech manufacturing sectors, such as furniture and textile production, have lower management scores. Other 
results are that Vietnam’s operations management and talent management scores are poorer than overall management 
scores. The results suggest that managers in Vietnam’s manufacturing firms must invest more in adopting management 
practices, which leads to a better output rate. This investment will also enhance human capital for firms.

1. Introduction
Technology investments are undeniably a primary driver for output growth. However, technology is not a panacea for 
productivity (Triebs and  Kumbhakar 2018; Rico and  Cabrer-Borrás 2021). Solow's 1957 study discovered that 88% 
of the US output growth per worker was due to factors other than capital accumulation (Rico and  Cabrer-Borrás 
2021). Costly technology investments, for example, would be a burden for a financially struggling firm to seek, acquire 
and assimilate suitable technology, not to mention to upgrade the skills of their existing workforce to use those new 
technologies (Bloom et al. 2016). Management contributes to firm-level productivity. It saves enterprises from 
financial constraints for capital and labor investments. According to a firm-level study in six European countries 
(France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom), firms with more adoption of management 
practices are more likely to increase labor productivity (Bloom et al. 2019; Rico and  Cabrer-Borrás 2021). A study 
in the US found that firm productivity growth is attributed to 52% of management practices, leaving only 10% for 
labor and approximately 38% for technology (Heizer and  Render 2014). Therefore, there needs to be more recognition 
of the importance of management in operations. 
1.1 Problem Statement 
Firm growth cannot be explained entirely by capital alone, as management is required to utilize capital (Bloom et al. 
2019; Scur et al. 2021). Management is also an input for sales growth (Bloom et al., 2016). Empirical studies have 
shown positive associations between labor productivity, sales growth, and management scores (World Bank 2020). 
Therefore, too much emphasis on technology and labor input would ignore the importance of management practices, 
causing a problem with efficiency otherwise achieved by good management. In Vietnam, identifying problems 
concerning adopting management practices helps firm managers recognize the need to bridge the management gap 
between local and foreign firms in high-income nations. 
1.2 Objectives 
Based on the above need, this study aims to achieve the following objectives: 
71","Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, September 12-14, 2023 
© IEOM Society International 
In Vietnam, overall management scores vary across enterprises of different sizes and sectors. In terms of firm size, 
overall management scores are higher in large-sized firms (Figure 5). Companies with between 50 and 100 workers 
have the lowest management scores. 
 
By sector, low-tech sectors such as furniture and textiles tend to have lower management scores (Figure 6). This 
finding is in line with the study results by Bloom et al. (2019), who postulate that this issue is because management 
practices are not only for production but also for research and development. Making furniture or textiles does not 
require research and development. 
 
5.5 Poor Management Aspects in Vietnam’s Manufacturing Firms 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  Boxplot of Management Dimensions in Vietnam 
 
Across the four management dimensions, Vietnam performs best in performance monitoring (3.08) and poorly in 
people management (2.70) and operations management (2.73) (Figure 7). The operations management score (2.73), 
measured by applying lean production practices, is smaller than the overall management score (2.82). Poor operations 
management implies that some Vietnam’s firms have not implemented modern manufacturing processes such as lean 
manufacturing systems. 
 
People management measures how companies manage talented people and whether there is a systematic way to treat 
good and bad performers. Vietnam’s people management score of 2.7 implies that some domestic firms have not 
followed standardized human resources management policies to motivate workers for better performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The findings imply that Vietnam’s manufacturing firms are underinvesting in management practices. It is important 
to train managers with managerial skills. In terms of operations management, some of Vietnam’s firms have not 
implemented modern manufacturing processes such as lean manufacturing systems, contributing to efficiency. 
Vietnam’s firms also underperform other peers in recruiting and retaining talented people.

The study challenges policy-makers to develop business environments that promote good management practices 
across all firms and drive the competitiveness of their entire economies. To achieve this objective, policies should 
enable domestic firms to recognize and adopt good management practices. 
Solutions for Vietnam’s firms include acquiring good management practices from foreign direct investments (FDI) 
by high-income countries. This suggestion is in line with the World Bank’s idea that FDI will help domestic firms 
with better management practices (World Bank 2020). Importantly, Vietnam’s manufacturing firms need to receive 
information regarding what are considered good management practices, which help very low-performing firms 
achieve at least a minimum level of management quality. Using World Management Survey instruments, which 
includes operations, performance monitoring, target management, and talent management, is a good start but not their 
list is short and not detailed. Firms need a more detailed management list, which can be obtained through consultants. 
Some consultant groups, such as Deloite, a leading management consultant company, can provide technical 
consultancy services on management practices. For example, the World Bank partnered with Deloite in its Business 
Management Advisory Support Project to support SMEs in obtaining free access to advisory business consultancy for 
growth (Deloitte 2018). Vietnam’s manufacturing needs to enlist the World Bank’s support for similar projects to 
enhance managerial capital

Abstract 
Occupational Hearing Loss (OHL) is observed when employees are subjected to high decibel levels or ototoxic 
substances that damage one’s hearing. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a condition that progresses gradually and 
is frequently unnoticed in its early stages due to the absence of observable symptoms. Noise-induced hearing loss is 
usually detected after effects on hearing ability, difficulty understanding speech, and affected communication. Most 
NIHL causes permanent neural damage but is preventable. The study aims were to determine the prevalence of 
decreasing hearing threshold among workers in the cloth convection home industry at Klaten, Central Java, Indonesia. 
The study used an observational analytic approach with a cross-sectional design, and the sample comprised 21 workers 
from the home industry. Through interviews, we collected demographic data, the onset of working, and the use of 
protective devices. All participants underwent pure tone audiometry and were categorized by noise exposure 
environment. A total of 21 workers, 18 (85.7%) female and 3 (14.3%) male are 31-60 years old, and the most duration 
of work is 11-20 years. The main results showed that the prevalence of decreasing hearing threshold among workers 
in this study was 33.3%. Hearing threshold decreasing was correlated with the onset of working more than ten years 
of experience (p = 0.001, r= 0.655). Ear protection is a habit in 10 (47.6%) workers.

Abstract 
The leading cause of death in the world is heart disease. For medical professionals, prediction is challenging because 
it requires a higher level of predictive expertise. There is a knowledge gap in the field of healthcare despite the 
abundance of information. Information is either present but not mined in underdeveloped nations like Zimbabwe, or 
it is present but not mined to gain insights. The data gathered over time by the healthcare industry can help Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technologies produce accurate predictions and decision-making outcomes. In this study, we used the 
Random Forest algorithm as our experimental model to evaluate AI's performance in predicting the risk of developing 
heart disease. With a recall of 91% and an F1-score of 83 percent, we were able to predict heart disease with an 
accuracy of 80% using a random forest algorithm. Thus, the most effective algorithm for classifying heart disease is 
the random forest algorithm.

Heart disease, Artificial Intelligence, Random Forest, Decision Support System 
1. Introduction
One of the biggest causes of death worldwide is cardiovascular disease (World Health Organization 2022). Heart 
disease is an acute medical issue that results in blocked, constricted, and restricted blood vessels, which can lead to 
strokes, angina, and cardiac arrest/attacks (Chang et al. 2022). According to the World Health Organization (2022), 
17.7 million deaths from heart disease occurred in 2015, making up 31% of all fatalities globally. The death rate from 
heart disease then rose considerably with the introduction of COVID-19, and the virus has since been linked to an 
elevated risk of poor cardiovascular health and mortality (Anon 2022). People with coronaviruses had a higher risk of 
developing heart disease, which was associated with negative outcomes (Li et al. 2020). The fear of developing the 
infectious disease caused patients to put off seeking medical attention, which led to a quick decline in their health and 
a significant increase in the number of people dying from heart disease worldwide. Due to the complexity of the 
condition and the difficulty in detecting it, cardiovascular disease must be treated with prudence. Risk factors for the 
disease include high blood pressure, cholesterol, an irregular heartbeat, the coronavirus, and others (Roth et al. 2020). 
Otherwise, the heart's effects will drastically cause death. 
Early prediction of cardiovascular disease is crucial in preserving patients' lives. A competent service involves both 
proper patient diagnosis, at the right time, in the right way, and the identification of appropriate medical treatment, 
while avoiding erroneous diagnoses. The provision of exceptional clinical services for heart disease patients is a major 
problem for healthcare institutions (Ali et al. 2021). Early identification of heart disease also saves money and 
decreases the mortality rate from Cardiovascular failure. Cardiovascular disease prediction at an earlier stage is a 
critical challenge. It is usually detected at later stages when it is already at a stage where it is fatal. In Zimbabwe in 
2018, there were 5,896 fatalities from coronary artery disease, or 4.96% of all deaths (WHO  2018).  
The ability to predict cardiovascular illness early is essential for saving patients' lives. Moreso, it saves money and 
lowers the death rate from cardiovascular failure. Predicting cardiovascular disease earlier on is a major difficulty. 
One of the biggest issues facing healthcare facilities is the provision of superior clinical services for patients with heart 
disease (Ali et al. 2021).  A competent service identifies the necessary medical therapy while avoiding incorrect

5.6 Limitations 
The dataset we used was from Kaggle because datasets of such information from local hospitals are either not willing 
to give or there do not have information management systems so the data is not available. Using Python as the coding 
language was sometimes challenging because it requires certain libraries to be installed and sometimes the libraries 
were refusing or taking time to install. 
 
5.7  Recommendations 
Zimbabwe should establish systems that use such a model for heart disease prediction, is the general proposal. The 
recommendation concerning factors will be to conduct additional studies on variables and construct such models based 
on the most pertinent variables that truly contribute to the danger like Blood pressure. If we improve the attributes, 
we can find more accurate results. If such systems are going to be deployed in Zimbabwe, a consolidated Electronics 
Health Record System should be put in place to integrate and gather data for analysis, ensuring that the data is 
accessible when such systems are constructed. Future research could focus on integrated illness prediction. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Prediction and diagnosis of heart disease have always been difficult undertakings for medical professionals. Costly 
procedures and therapies for cardiac illnesses are available in hospitals and other medical institutions. Using machine 
learning techniques, we developed a strategy for predicting heart illness in this paper. The findings demonstrated a 
high accuracy standard for delivering improved estimation results. The key benefits of utilizing machine learning to 
forecast heart disease are that it allows for early heart disease detection, manages massive amounts of data using the 
random forest method and feature selection, and is both patient- and cost-friendly.

Abstract 
Through the optimization of business operations and the fulfillment of employee needs, an effective facility layout is 
essential to the success of manufacturing industrial output. It guarantees a smooth system operation, reduces wasted 
space, and maximizes resource efficiency. The goal of this study is to identify and address problems that lead to waste 
and reduce productivity by examining the facility layout of a shoe manufacturing company in Marikina. To accomplish 
this goal, the main causes of issues with the current facility design were found using the Ishikawa Diagram. Pro Model 
simulation software was likewise employed to examine and recommend a creative facility layout design that 
maximizes output and eliminates waste in the company's production process. The findings of the study  indicated that 
lower output levels were significantly attributed to the current facility layout. As a result, a new facility plan was 
suggested, which led to a significant increase in production output of 16.67%. The shoe factory's manufacturing 
processes might be optimized, waste reduced, and efficiency increased by putting the suggested facility layout concept 
into practice. By highlighting the significance of facility layout optimization in boosting efficiency and overall 
operational performance, this work makes a significant contribution to the field of facility layout optimization.

1. Introduction
Through the use of tools, equipment, and labor, the manufacturing sector plays a critical part in converting raw 
materials into completed goods. Implementing a suitable facility layout becomes essential given the wide range of 
manufacturing operations involved. Ishak et al. (2020) claim that the facility architecture is a key component of the 
manufacturing sector and includes a range of tactics for allocating factory resources to support a smooth production 
process. It also plays a crucial role in overall business operations, helping to meet staff needs and maximize production 
efficiency (Jones  2022). 
Manufacturing footwear is a labor-intensive industry that involves the separate production of various parts such as 
soles, toe caps, heels, and welts, which are later assembled by workers on an assembly line. The shoe manufacturing 
process consists of multiple phases to bring together all the components. The specific equipment and processes used 
in shoe production vary depending on the type of shoes being manufactured. However, this process can be time-
consuming and complex, particularly for companies involved in large-scale shoe production. Therefore, having an 
effective facility layout is crucial in organizing the manufacturing operations efficiently, optimizing the production 
process, and meeting the needs of employees. 
Marikina City in the Philippines is widely recognized as the Shoe Capital of the country due to its thriving shoe

The Pro Model simulation also demonstrated how frequently the Upper Making Machine and the Sewing Section's 
machines were blocked. This shows that in order to increase output production and decrease downtime, it may be 
necessary to consider strategies other than facility layout. The proposed layout's total number of exits increased 
significantly, according to the scoreboard analysis. The number increased by 16.67% from 54 in the existing 
arrangement to 63 in the proposed layout. This suggests that the suggested structure improved the efficiency and speed 
of product completion within the production facility. Additionally, compared to the current layout, less time was spent 
on average in the system and during operation. This decrease in time denotes increased effectiveness and output. 
Shorter production cycles and quicker turnaround times for each product were achieved thanks to the manufacturing 
process optimization in the suggested layout. With a noticeable increase of exits and a reduction in system and 
operation's average time, the suggested plan clearly outperformed the current arrangement. These enhancements 
demonstrate how the suggested architecture can improve the manufacturing facility's overall performance. The 
proposed facility layout in terms of enhanced output production, ultimately exhibited positive results. However, the 
operation's high levels of idle time point to a need for development and the necessity to take into account extra tactics, 
such adding more machinery, to boost worker productivity. These results offer insightful information for further 
manufacturing facility optimization.

Abstract 
Predicting crop yield in general is critical for agricultural planning, resource allocation, and food security. The 
recent adverse effects of climate change on agricultural productivity have given rise to crop yield prediction which 
is essential in assisting farmers in anticipating the worst and preparing accordingly. Maize is one of the most 
popular staple foods in sub-Saharan Africa, and at the same time is the most affected by climate change. Knowing 
the expected maize yield in advance therefore helps those communities that are heavily dependent on maize, to 
prepare in advance to handle the projected situation. Despite several efforts that have been done to predict maize 
crop yield, the topic remains an open discussion. This paper joins the debate and uses data analytics and machine 
learning to build a reliable predictive model for estimating maize crop yield. Using historical maize crop yield, 
weather, and environmental data, the Random Forest Regressor (RFR) technique is trained to capture non-linear 
patterns and identify complex correlations in the data. The results of the model’s evaluation show an accuracy of 
70.52% demonstrating the model’s ability to capture a substantial portion of the variability in the data. The 
predictive model can be useful for maize production farmers and maize grain depots, as it gives them time to plan 
for the future. Policymakers may benefit from the model, as it helps them to make informed policies on grain 
management. Future research should consider testing this model in a live environment, before packing it for 
deployment on a large scale.

1. Introduction
Crop yield prediction is an important area of research in the field of agriculture and “has the potential to increase 
productivity and improve food security” (Khaki and Wang 2019). The availability of large amounts of data from 
numerous sources like as satellite imagery, weather stations, and sensors, has enabled the development of 
machine-learning models for crop yield prediction. Machine learning algorithms are designed to learn patterns 
from observations and relationships in data (Foote 2022). This allows them to make predictions and identify 
trends. For crop yield prediction, machine learning models can be trained on historical crop data to predict future 
yields based on a range of factors. Crop yield prediction is normally based on soil type, meteorological, 
environmental, and crop parameters. Climate change, soil degradation, and lack of modern tools and technology 
have resulted in less productivity by many farmers. Using smart farming tools like environmental sensors that 
gather features such as light, temperature, humidity, and soil quality in real-time enables farmers to make smart, 
informed decisions to enhance productivity (Ground Control 2021).  
Yield loss, normal yield, and yield increment determine continuity in farming prospects. Globally, crop yield 
prediction is constantly evolving as new technologies and methods are developed to improve accuracy and 
reliability. Remote sensing technology together with machine learning algorithms is progressively being used to 
predict crop yields. These tools allow for the collection of data from various sources. Gornott et al. (2021) 
conducted a study in Germany that demonstrated that remote sensing combined with machine learning could 
accurately predict crop yields. Climate change is projected to have a significant impact on crop yields globally 
(SubbaRao et al. 2023). This has resulted in new methods of crop yield prediction being developed to account for 
changing weather patterns. A study by (Zhang et al. 2020) in China shows that climate variables could be used to 
predict crop yields. The availability of large datasets is increasingly being used to improve crop yield prediction. 
For example, (Liu et al. 2021) did a study in China that showed that big data analytics could be used to predict

The Linear Regression R-squared value gave an approximate 59.3% accuracy showing that the 
variance in the dependent variable (crop yield) is explained by the independent variables that 
were used in the model. The results of the Random Forest Regressor model of 70.5% achieved 
a relatively lower Mean Squared Error and a moderate R-squared value indicating a reasonable 
level of accuracy and a reasonable amount of variance explained by the independent variables. 
This suggests that the RFR model captures a reasonable portion of the variability in the data, 
indicating moderate predictive power. 
 
Using the model, it is possible to make future yield predictions using forecasted values by 
inputting the forecasted parameter values. The model also has the ability to output the predicted 
value for the required year. Figure 3 shows an example of the input code for given variables in 
the model.

5.2 Implications for decision makers 
Accurate maize crop yield predictions have a significant importance for farmers’ decisions. 
Timely and dependable forecasts enable efficient resource distribution and other crop 
management strategies. The model’s anticipation can function as early warning system, 
enabling proactive measures to counter potential yield reductions and economic setbacks. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The design of a crop yield prediction model involves careful consideration of data collection, 
preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Developing 
models that can accurately predict crop yields can be achieved by using a structured approach 
of collecting comprehensive and high-quality data. Conducting thorough data preprocessing 
and feature engineering, experimenting with different model architectures, and regularly 
evaluating and refining the model can also produce accurate models. However, it is important 
to be aware of the limitations and challenges such as data quality and availability, the 
complexity of crop-yield relationships, generalization to different regions and crop types, and 
the dynamic nature of crop-yield relationships.

Abstract 
Technology will continue to develop as time goes by and human needs are increasingly complex. One of the issues 
currently being discussed is the issue of sustainability and renewable energy to reduce high air emissions. The 
Indonesian government aims to reduce carbon emissions, one of which is by increasing the number of electric vehicles 
used. Convertible electric motorbikes are a technological innovation that comes from university research. In order to 
support the development and commercialization of conversion kit technology, a model framework is needed. This 
research discusses the technological entrepreneurship and innovation system model that is suitable for the 
development of supporting technology for electric convertibles produced in Indonesia. Meanwhile, other aspects that 
will be discussed regarding technology development, namely technology push or market pull. Furthermore, the 
product development process is also discussed to find out how to prevent technological innovation from falling into 
the valley of death. This study aims to develop strategies and provide lessons learned to readers so that technology 
commercialization can run well. The results of the analysis show that the conversion kit technology innovation 
currently still requires outreach because public interest is still not large, besides that the supply chain network of a 
conversion workshop is still not clearly defined. So that over time, the government and the conversion workshop work 
together to develop a supply chain for conversion kit components.

1. Introduction
In 2016, Indonesia along with 171 other countries in the world signed the Paris agreement at the United Nation 
Headquarters, New York, United States. This agreement is a global agreement in dealing with world climate change. 
As one of the countries with the sixth largest carbon emissions in the world, Indonesia has a role as part of the global

needs to be good collaboration between universities and academics of an institution to increase technological 
variations such as joint research projects.  
 
Relationship is related to the relationship between the conversion workshop and customers and suppliers or can be 
called a supply chain network. Current conditions make conversion workshops have to import products from other 
countries to be able to meet the demand of potential consumers, while on the other hand the government is also 
supporting so that the value of the domestic content level of conversion kit products can be superior. In the case of 
new design electric motorcycles, the government only provides subsidies or assistance to electric motorcycle brands 
that have a domestic content level value of at least 40%. Furthermore, the government is also starting to prepare a 
strategy to be able to apply this to electric convertible motorcycles, so that the use of domestic products can be more 
optimal.  
 
Technology and infrastructure participate in supporting the electric vehicle ecosystem in Indonesia. The government 
through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has prepared a roadmap for battery-based electric motorized 
vehicles up to 2030. A technological entrepreneur needs to prepare a strategy to manage the available technology and 
infrastructure, including providing proposals regarding the provision of infrastructure that supports increasing electric 
vehicle users, namely battery swap system. With the existence of infrastructure that supports one's mobility when 
using an electric vehicle, users will not have to worry about using the vehicle.  
 
Conclusion 
This study aims to develop strategies and provide lessons learned to readers so that technology commercialization can 
run well. In the process of determining the company's strategy, researchers obtained data based on brief interviews 
and literature studies from articles and journals that discussed conversion kit technology. The conversion kit is a 
technological innovation that was born from a series of research and development processes carried out by the 
university, then came into being as a spin-off university called PT. XYZ. The researcher acts as a technology 
entrepreneur trying to provide suggestions and solutions for companies regarding what companies can do in order to 
continue to earn revenue while keeping conversion kit technology innovation from falling into the valley of death. 
One solution that can be proposed is to maintain the quality of the conversion kit manufactured by the company, but 
still maintain a selling price that can compete with other competitors. So that potential users will have the view that 
conversion kit technology, which is the result of university research and development, has high competitiveness when 
compared to other products.

Abstract 
There are many marketplace innovations that have been created and adopted by people in Indonesia. The marketplace 
property product is facilitating the transaction process from End to End in PT ABC. Unfortunately, studies on the 
study of the relationship between innovation systems and technopreneurs from a commercialization point of view are 
still very limited. This article provides a survey of technopreneur analysis and innovation systems that are suitable for 
a technology marketplace. This article highlights the common challenges and obstacles faced by companies, R&D, 
and product teams in developing technology entrepreneurship and the benefits for them. This article takes a case from 
the marketplace property application from PT ABC. The existing products of the company are carefully selected to 
examine the framework of the technopreneur approach and innovation systems. The analysis was carried out by 
referring to the technopreneur approach and innovation system to understand the process of innovation management 
and applied technopreneur analysis. This article uses scrapping data from user reviews as a basis for SWOT analysis 
to develop a two-matrix strategy. So, it becomes the basis for improvement to increase adoption from marketplace 
users. The results show that this marketplace technology has reached the adoption stage. However, as many as 31% 
of users are still dissatisfied with the use of existing applications, especially household services which still require a 
lot of improvement, such as the development of features in the application.

1. Introduction
Based on data from Bank Indonesia (2022), the trend for house or residential property prices on the primary market 
has continued to increase in the third quarter of 2019. This is reflected in the Bank Indonesia Survey which stated the 
residential property price index in that period was 210.33. This figure shows a growth of 1.8% from the same period 
last year. Based on these figures, the property trend in Indonesia shows a significant increase compared to the growth 
rate in the previous quarter of 0.5%. According to Schreiben Reiys (2013), the Indonesian people's need for property 
is still very high. This is because the property is a fairly promising investment product, especially types of real estate 
properties such as houses, land, and other buildings. This is evidenced by the continued increase in asset values, rare 
price fluctuations, plus relatively low risk, making the property one of the public's investment products. 
In 2020, Indonesia experienced an economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic (RI Ministry of Finance Data 
2021). The slowdown harmed various sectors in Indonesia, one of which was the property sector. Most property prices, 
such as houses, apartments, and motorized vehicles, also experienced a significant decline. This was due to a decrease 
in demand for property which was driven by an increase in public caution in spending amid a pandemic. In addition, 
the existence of limited access and interaction between one party and another is also the cause of the decline in the 
property sector. Where the process of buying and selling the property itself requires access that is wide enough to 
carry out the survey process to interact with various parties.

matrices, companies can efficiently provide value to customers so that the resulting innovations can be successful in 
the market. First, analysis of technology development and innovation processes can be the basis for the process of 
developing and improving existing technology in companies. This becomes the basis for the direction of development, 
the basis for development, and the existing implementation process. Second, this SWOT matrix analysis can be used 
as a detailed step that discusses how companies develop product innovations that can generate profits. Third, based 
on the SWOT matrix that was developed later became the basis for designing the SO strategy matrix, ST strategy, WO 
strategy, and WT strategy as suggestions for companies to make improvements going forward. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on this research, the marketplace helps consumers needs easily make property buying and selling transactions 
in E2E. Not only in terms of buying and selling property, various additional superior products such as household 
services are also provided to help consumers' needs in their daily needs. This marketplace from PT ABC has reached 
the adoption stage and has been downloaded by thousands of users. This marketplace has an open innovation model 
in its technology development, so various reviews from users may become the basis for improving and developing 
existing applications. Through the results of data scrapping from the review sample, it was found that as many as 31% 
of users were still dissatisfied with using existing applications. In addition, out of 100 existing reviews, as many as 
44% consisted of negative reviews. Thus, the reviews and results of the innovation analysis form the basis for 
preparing the SWOT matrix for designing corporate strategy. Where, one of them is still the need for various 
improvements to features according to the needs of users, starting from ensuring the feature does not have errors, 
providing C2C features so that service providers directly connect with customers, refund system features when orders 
are canceled, and features that are connected to Google maps to facilitate service providers to the location of 
consumers. The drawback of this research is that it has not examined how to determine the most priority strategy to 
be carried out in the development of this product. It is hoped that future research can do this with an approach that 
integrates SWOT with Multi-Criterion Decision Making (MDCM).

Abstract 
The global logistics industry is facing increasing complexity, making effective logistics management crucial for 
reducing costs and gaining a competitive edge. Blockchain technology emerges as a potential solution, enhancing 
supply chain transparency and traceability for Thailand's logistics sector. However, understanding implementation 
challenges is crucial before investing in blockchain. This study analyzes obstacles using the index of item objective 
congruence (IOC) technique and expert opinions. The findings identify seven significant barriers: lack of awareness, 
lack of trust, lack of government support, lack of top management support and organizational policy, collaboration 
and network establishment issues, lack of operational standards, and technical challenges. The lack of government 
support ranks highest, highlighting the need for early consideration of regulatory standards and policies. These 
findings provide valuable guidance for organizations aiming to embrace digital transformation through blockchain 
implementation.

1. Introduction
Logistics involves overseeing the movement of products, information, and other resources from their point of origin 
to their intended destination. It encompasses activities such as information transfer, transportation, inventory 
management, raw material administration, and packaging. In the business realm, effective logistics management plays 
a vital role in cost reduction, revenue enhancement, and fostering trustworthy relationships with customers. Regardless 
of the industry, logistics is an indispensable function as long as goods are manufactured (Jwd Group 2023). Therefore, 
the logistics industry has garnered increased interest from numerous participants in the supply chain. As the logistics 
system becomes more complex, efficiency declines, and the demand for transparency rises (Canorea 2023).  
The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted Thailand's logistics industry, with international giants outperforming 
local companies due to superior supply chain management. Compared to transportation expenditures, the Thai logistics 
industry exhibits a 14.1% higher ratio of logistics expenses to gross domestic product (GDP) than the regional average. 
Therefore, the Thai logistics industry should focus on reducing transportation costs and rapidly improving 
transportation infrastructure to enhance its overall efficiency. Utilizing technologies that integrate transport data to 
address logistics challenges presents another opportunity to reduce costs and foster the development of logistics 
performance (Marketeer 2023). 
Blockchain technology is now recognized as a potentially transformative technology that can revolutionize 
organizational operations, especially in light of the ongoing digitalization trend that has the potential to disrupt various 
businesses (Nagariya et al. 2022). With its decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain technology simplifies asset 
monitoring and transaction recording, thereby reducing risk and increasing efficiency for all participants in the 
business chain. This enables organizations to enhance their work effectiveness (International Business Machines 
2023). The implementation of blockchain technology is expected to have a positive impact on supply chains and the 
logistics industry, as it has the potential to reduce costs and improve information flow among supply chain participants 
(Hackius and Petersen 2020).

the primary barriers. This was because top management was the one who made decisions for the organization, so if 
they were not interested in or indifferent to blockchain, the implementation would never happen.

Issues with collaboration and network establishment (B8) were considered a relatively big barrier when most experts 
believed that, to use blockchain at full capacity by making the data flow in real-time and providing more effective 
services, all parties needed to be involved in data sharing. On the other hand, one expert said that for a supply chain, 
only the major nodes needed to collaborate, but for other minor nodes, just sending the information was enough, and 
they did not need to invest in blockchain. The lack of operation standards for blockchain (B10) was widely 
acknowledged by experts as a major barrier to the adoption of blockchain technology in the Thai logistics industry. 
This obstacle arose because without established standards, companies might struggle to learn from Thailand's best 
practices and actual use cases, impeding their ability to effectively harness the potential of blockchain. Technical 
challenges (B11) were considered a relatively significant barrier. According to most experts, blockchain technology 
was the newest technology, and the technological immaturity of the system might pose technical challenges such as a 
system scalability problem, lack of function that protects incorrect records from entering the system, and others. 
 
5. Conclusions 
This study has identified and analyzed the barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology in the logistics industry 
in Thailand. Initially, a preliminary list of barriers was created by reviewing relevant literature covering various 
industries. The significant barriers that fit the specific circumstances of the logistics industry in Thailand were 
validated using the IOC technique through interviews with experts from both academic and industry sectors who 
possess experience in logistics and blockchain technology in Thailand. From the preliminary list of 14 barriers, seven 
remained significant based on their average IOC scores exceeding 0.5. They include lack of awareness (B1), lack of 
trust (B2), lack of government support (B5), lack of top management support and organizational policy (B6), issues 
with collaboration and network establishment (B8), lack of operational standards for blockchain (B10), and technical 
challenges (B11). 
 
The findings provide valuable guidance for Thai logistics companies interested in implementing blockchain 
technology, enabling them to address the identified barriers and enhance the effectiveness of their processes. Notably, 
government support emerged as the most concerning barrier among the experts, as indicated by the highest IOC index 
score. This suggests that appropriate regulatory standards, government policies, legal permissions, and digital policies 
should have been carefully considered from the early stages of implementation.

This study is a pilot study aiming to screen for significant barriers to the implementation of blockchain technology in 
the logistics industry in Thailand. A future study will investigate and establish the hierarchical relationships among 
these seven barriers by using the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method.

Abstract 
Finding a safe evacuation route is important in the event of an accident or natural disaster. Along with the climate 
change in recent years, torrential rains have become more occasional than before in both urban and rural areas. 
Intensive and continuing rainfall may lead to disasters such as landslides and inundations. Even if a single point on an 
evacuation route is inundated or critically damaged, then the route is unavailable and the evacuees who were planning 
to use it must find another route. In addition, in lowland districts in urban areas, where a large number of local people 
reside, might rush on limited available roads, particularly when a mandatory evacuation is alerted. This may raise 
another type of risk by excessive human flow or traffic congestion. Most hazard maps are created according to 
geographical elevations, which quantifies the extent of flood risk, typically in terms of inundation depth. Those kinds 
of maps may be useful for averting or mitigating property damage, while it is not tied with safeness of evacuation 
routes. In the case of an inundation in lowland areas, a large number of roads in the vicinity of rivers would become 
inundated and unavailable. This type of temporal risk due to congestion has not been considered to date. This study 
along this line considers both geographical elevations and availability of roads. A lowland district in eastern Tokyo, 
Adachi City, is focused on for an assessment. Empirical findings highlight the impact of traffic congestion and 
isolation of flooded areas.

1. Introduction
Along with the climate change in recent years, personal and property damages caused by extraordinary weathers such 
as torrential rains and furious typhoons have increased the necessity of risk re-assessment of river flooding and flood 
disaster. In the event of a sudden disaster such as flooding and landslide, prompt evacuation may aid avoiding or 
decreasing personal damage, while the shortest or shorter routes might not be available as evacuation routes. Not only 
natural disasters but also human flows might cause an accident or even lead to a disaster. For instance, the Itaewon

Figure 10. Congestion simulation for inundation depth 𝐻𝐻= 6  
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, congestion calculations were conducted to create flood inundation maps. The main purpose of creating 
this map is to avert encountering accidents and delays in evacuation due to excessive human flow. The outlet may 
serve as new hazard maps. The results of the congestion computation indicate that even the impact by narrow streets 
is noticeable because the shortest routes are the most congested than the main streets. People who are familiar with 
minor roads around the area, such as local residents, can rush into shortcuts that have a higher risk of human and/or 
traffic accidents. Instead, evacuating using arterial road could avoid accidents associated with human flow. If the 
results of this study will be used as hazard maps, only the simulated congestion may be opened to public. The flow of 
people will be dispersed as evacuees reach their destinations, avoiding the routes with thicker lines with their 
judgment. In addition to the obtained inundation maps, it is necessary for each individual to be aware of existing 
hazard maps published by local governments. Non-flooded roads will help people avoiding from detour by 
encountering flooded areas, and will aid them to evacuate efficiently without increasing human flow. Future work 
may take into account data such as population distribution, road width, and number of lanes. Experiments using a 
more realistic number of roads may be conducted to obtain more detailed results.

Abstract 
This study aimed to provide sustainable school and office supplies through the utilization of air waste and one of the 
most abundant wastes in the Philippines, sugarcane bagasse. The bagasse is identified to be one of the top agricultural 
wastes in the country. Research suggests that it posed a great threat to the environment because of its underutilized 
remains. The study is from a premise that in a hectare of a sugarcane plantation, it may produce 11 to 21 tons of 
agricultural waste, subsequently, this waste is either left in a way it will rot or burned, which may be partly responsible 
for global warming. The research is focused on addressing environmental waste through a product that would generate 
income as well as reduce waste. The proponents developed a product named: CoalAsse. It is a sustainably made pencil 
from the residue of sugarcane, and agricultural waste. The need analysis was conducted using a qualitative study. 
Through further analysis, numerous tests, and assessment of the project, it demonstrated that bagasse is an effective 
material for sustainable school and office supplies.

1. Introduction
The study focused on the feasibility of MaxIEma, an ecopreneur company that developed sustainable school and office 
supplies through the utilization of air and agricultural waste in the Philippines. The company aimed to determine the 
viability of MaxIEma, a company that promotes environmental science and offers solution to the increasing effect of 
climate change and helps reduce environmental waste. The company name, MaxIEma, was derived from the latin 
maxima, which means greatest or highest quantity of outcomes possible. The name gives relevance to the company's 
goal of attaining sustainable lifestyles by using sustainable school/office supplies through using air and agricultural 
waste in the Philippines. It also promotes awareness about the current issues of increasing agricultural waste and other 
pollutants in the Philippines. The launching product of MaxIEma is an alternative to commercial charcoal pencils 
made from air waste converted into charcoal, and its body is made from agricultural waste.  
The MaxIEma’s mission is to provide sustainable products mainly school office supplies that provide a solution to the 
increasing effect of environmental waste in the Philippines. The mockup company is also designed to help offer job 
opportunities for local sugarcane farmers in the Philippines, and increase awareness on the current issues of increasing 
agricultural waste and other pollutants in the Philippines. Air Pollution has been a problem for our environment. 
Additionally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), almost 99% of the world's population breathes air 
that contains a high level of pollutants that exceeds the WHO guidelines. Casually, prolonged exposure to air pollution 
can affect every organ in the body, leading to a wide range of various diseases, such as lung cancer. The sugarcane 
industry produces 11 to 21 tons of waste; some of its waste is burned (Sugarcane Wastes Eyed as Animal Feed, Fuel 
Briquette 2020). One of the most prevalent agricultural processing wastes produced around the world is sugarcane 
bagasse (Doddapaneni and Kikas 2021).  According to the UN, tree-cutting or deforestation where 8 Million trees are 
cut down yearly to produce commercial pencils.

This section contains the decision analysis that will further help determine if the launching product is financially 
feasible. The price of the product is based on the materials and supplies, labor, utilities, and other costs that contribute 
to manufacturing the product. The price of CoalAsse by MaxIEma is ₱89 per unit. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Decision Analysis 
 
Figure 5 shows that the majority of the decision analysis is approved. The payback period is 1 year and 7 months 
shows that it is earlier than 5 years. The net present value shows a positive value and a high decent one. Also, the 
profitability index is approved as it is greater than 1. Lastly, the internal rate of return is 66% shows that it is higher 
than 15%. To sum up, the product proves that it is feasible.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The MaxIEma company was successful in utilizing pollution and developing it into a new product, CoalAsse. Based 
on the technical aspect of the study, the bagasse was a material that can be used for the body of the pencil. On the 
other hand, processed air dust was also an effective material for charcoal lead. Moreover, MaxIEma was successful in 
entering the competitive market through its introductory pencil product. Based on the survey of 156 respondents, 
94.2% of them are willing to buy the product even if the price is higher than the existing charcoal pencil in the market. 
It also has a 1-year and 7-month payback period, which is within the 5-year range payback period to be accepted as 
financially feasible. Therefore, with the technical, market, and financial aspects of CoalAsse being feasible, MaxIEma 
was concluded by the proponents to be a successful and viable company.

Abstract 
This research aims to study the production process and improve the production efficiency of a precast concrete 
floor company in Pathum Thani province, Thailand. The research seeks to help the company improve and enhance 
its production efficiency by using Pareto charts to identify problems and employing a Why-Why analysis to 
determine the root causes. The ECRS principle is then applied to address the identified issues and facilitate process 
improvement. Based on the current research, the main problems identified are as follows:  production efficiency 
is not reaching its full potential with an average production rate of 26,460.22 square meters, employee health is 
affected by work fatigue due to long working hours, averaging 10.95 hours per day, and labor costs amount to an 
average of 231,841.90 baht per month. After implementing the ECRS and modifying the work procedures, the 
research indicates that the production efficiency has improved, with an average monthly production rate of 
29,973.82 square meters. Additionally, the average daily working hours have decreased by 7.78 hours, and labor 
costs have been reduced to 199,825.50 baht per month. The percentages are as follows: 1) Production efficiency 
increased by 10.88%, 2) Working time decreased by 19.67%, and 3) labor cost decreased by 13.80%.

1. Introduction
Risks are anticipated in the construction sector in 2022 due to the sharp increase in transportation and building 
material costs. The Russo-Ukrainian War, which led to higher prices for necessary building supplies, including 
steel and cement, and increasing oil prices, was responsible for these elevated expenses. In the years 2023 and 
2024, the construction industry is expected to expand in step with the expected rise in the value of total 
construction investments, which is predicted to rise by an average of 4.5 to 5.5% annually. 
The precast concrete floors come in 3 varieties: solid, three-legged, and hollow. Due to their affordability and 
flexibility in terms of length options, clients highly seek these sorts. As a result, manufacturing must accommodate 
different project allocations and client needs, which might wear down workers during production. This makes it 
difficult to manage production cycle durations and reach production goals, which has detrimental effects, 
including incomplete production and lost commercial chances. The company and the experts agree that increasing 
productivity in the precast concrete slab production process is crucial, given the relevance of this issue. Thus, this 
case study aimed to address these issues and boost production effectiveness.

In addition, a 360,000 baht plastering machine was ordered to replace the previous unit's sluggish operation. 
Working time was maximized due to installing these labor-saving devices, which decreased the need for manual 
labor. 
 
1.4 Conclusion 
The results of improving production efficiency for precast concrete slabs can be summarized as follows: 
 
1. The production line workflows have been eagerly anticipated, but unfortunately, they have resulted in high 
cycle times and significant production wastage. 
 
2. One strategy for enhancing the production process is modifying each team's attendance time, dramatically 
shortening wait times. To maintain consistent production efficiency, this modification presents a problem 
regarding job fatigue. 
 
3. To enhance production, one strategy is to invest in additional capital machinery. This investment can reduce 
time and decrease the number of employees required, from 21 individuals to 16. Consequently, the wage 
difference can be allocated towards accounting for the machine's payback period. 
 
1.5 Discussion 
The popularity and high demand for concrete slabs, the research company's best-selling product, led to the start 
of this study. Internal company conversations were held to investigate how better to address consumer 
expectations in response to this market demand. The researcher, therefore, concentrated on increasing 
manufacturing effectiveness, resulting in an astounding output of about 29,973.82 square meters. The company's 
ability to better manage production parameters and, as a result, better satisfy consumer demand increases due to 
this greater efficiency. Additionally, the company's competitive position is strengthened by this greater efficiency, 
which boosts revenue generation. 
 
Suggestion 
1. All the recorded data in this study have been collected from actual operations, allowing for more 
accurate and insightful analysis. 
2. The ability of the workers to satisfy the production capacity means that the production process still 
depends on their talents. Their knowledge and skill are essential for the production process to run well. 
3. Further research can be conducted to explore the possibility of reducing the number of employees by 
leveraging additional capital machinery in other processes. The business can increase production efficiency and 
possibly lessen its dependency on manual labor by finding areas where automation or mechanization can be used. 
This line of inquiry has the potential to raise output, reduce costs, and boost operational efficiency. he 
percentages are as follows.

1. Introduction
Transportation with conventional technology, known as Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), has contributed as the 
most significant contributor to global carbon emissions (IEA 2016) and accounts for half of the daily oil consumption 
(IEA 2015). This has become an environmental issue that has attracted the attention and focus of many parties, 
including the government. Along with these environmental issues, the development of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) 
has been urged by policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Larson et al. 2014; Schuitema et al. 2013). Since then, 
the technology transition process from ICE to electric vehicles has been accelerated, as electric vehicles are believed 
to be the future ZEVs (Batlle 2011). 
Several researchers have discussed topics relevant to the technology transition for electric vehicles or electric 
motorcycles. Struben's research has measured the willingness to consider the type of powertrain experiencing a 
technological transition from ICE to a powertrain with alternative fuels (Struben and Sterman 2008). Other studies build 
on Struben's research to forecast the market using various methods from dynamic systems, Markov models, and mixed-
logit models (Deuten et al. 2020; Gomez Vilchez et al. 2013; Gomez Vilchez and Thiel 2020; Harrison et al. 2016, 
2018; Jones et al. 2013; Pasaoglu et al. 2016). In addition, there are studies discussing policies for both electric vehicles,

analysis, the opportunity to develop research related to market projections and analysis of subsidy and incentive 
policies, especially for electric motorbikes in Indonesia, is still wide open. 
 
4. 
Conclusion 
The data collection results show that there are 32 research articles related to technology transition and electric vehicles 
from 2000 to 2023. The data analysis using VOS Viewer showed this study's five most frequently used keywords. 
These keywords are related to technology transition, electric vehicles, transportation, climate change, and greenhouse 
gases. The articles obtained were also categorized by topic, with most articles discussing future market projections, 
policy analysis to reduce emissions, and policy analysis related to technology transition. Based on the study's results, 
opportunities and directions for future research are (1) developing simulation models to project the electric motorcycle 
market and (2) analyzing the effectiveness of subsidy and incentive policies for electric motorcycles. Limitations of 
the bibliometric analysis in this article are attributed to the exclusion of other document sources such as PubMed or 
Web of Science.

Abstract 
The accessibility and usability of public toilet bowls have been difficult for people with disabilities and senior citizens. 
Since our body is regularly releasing fluid and we do not know when we need it, convenient access to the public toilet 
bowl is essential to making the lives of people with limited mobility easier when going to the public toilet. The study 
attempts to provide a solution to the uncomfortable public restroom experience from the perspective of senior citizens 
and persons with disabilities, which can cause strain, sprain, or injury due to their unique needs caused by their 
condition or age as they grow older. Therefore, this research aims to examine the availability of public restrooms for 
people with disabilities and the elderly in Metro Manila by providing them with access to a generally more efficient 
utility toilet bowl. To accurately draw the results based on the interview with the senior citizens and persons with 
disabilities (PWD), the researchers will interpret the results in Google Forms using the pie chart and tabular 
presentation. The researchers must precisely discover the fundamental obstacle that physically challenged humans 
encounter when using public restrooms and propose the probable remedy to this problem due to the meticulous 
observation, introspection, and data gathering that the researchers conducted.

Abstract 
The global emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the education system to adjust to the presumed new normal. 
Primary education students were substantially affected upon returning to the traditional set-up of the school; most 
notably, they showed signs of inadequate skills in reading and comprehending simple sentences. Moreover, the 
attractiveness of technology to children nowadays has become predominant, in opposition to the popularity of 
Philippine folk literature, which is given little importance and needs an introduction to Filipino youth today. 
Furthermore, with children immersed in technology, this study incorporated Philippine folk literature to be adapted 
into a system-based mobile application, which will further improve the reading and comprehension of primary students 
in urban areas as they utilize this new educational material. This mobile application exhibits an innovative approach 
to the sustainability of the writings of the local authors, which are enriched by utilizing modern technology to be 
enjoyed while learning. The researchers developed primary data using a mixed methodology technique to serve as a 
source for creating a design-based mobile application. The result of the study presented the effectiveness of technology 
in improving reading and comprehension with an added element of student engagement by utilizing local Filipino folk 
literature.

1. Introduction
During the pandemic, children developed a dependency on various forms of technology, and reports indicate that this 
trend persisted after the global pandemic. According to Qizi (2021), as cited in Hashim, Z. B., & Aziz, A. A. (2021), 
the scholar explained how technology is used to review past studies on using technology to improve language learning 
skills, and made some suggestions for bettering the integration of these technologies to help students improve their 
learning. Furthermore, gamification is introduced in education today with the objectives of enhancing the level of 
engagement of the students for learning and optimization, as well as support for behavioral changes and socialization 
with fellow students (Knutas et al. 2014; Krause et al. 2015; Dichev and Dicheva 2017; Borges et al. 2013, as cited in 
Smiderle et al. 2020). It generates involvement with the educational environment as a strategy for further enhancement 
and the transfer of knowledge to students (Dichev and Dicheva 2017, as cited in Smiderle et al. 2020). 
For more than a year, the Philippines has closed its face-to-face learning modalities, which causes learning loss, mental 
distress, a heightened risk of drop-outs, etc. The youngest learner in the country is in a critical developmental stage 
because of this, according to UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov stated in 2021. 
Specifically, the reading and comprehension skills of the students deteriorated during the pandemic. The United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (2022) stated in their report that 3 out of 20 students can read simple texts, in 
large part because of the longer closure of schools in the country. UNICEF’s latest assessment of learning poverty 
states that 10-year-olds cannot read or understand simple stories—a percentage of more than 80% compared to the

According to the interview, it was stated that the lack of materials in Philippine literature, their inaccessibility, or the 
difficulty of obtaining such materials are some of the major reasons why the majority of respondents who are parents 
or guardians encountered difficulties in teaching their children about Philippine folk literature. Also based on the 
results of the survey, 248 or 55% rate of the respondent disagree that it is easy to find Philippine folk literature books 
and materials for their children, and 311 or 69% rate disagrees that their children can easily find materials about 
Philippine folk literature on their own. 357 or 45% rate of the respondents experienced an endless amount of 
paperwork and scheduled work hours, followed by children's lack of discipline and attention when teaching (17% 
rate), and lack of encouragement and motivation under challenging times for the students (16% rate of respondents). 
The researchers found that this resulted in their finding that the majority of respondents who are parents or guardians 
encountered these difficulties. Also, the result of the interview with the professionals, the lack of promotion, and the 
preference of Filipinos for westernized work over local ones are considered barriers. 
 
4. What developmental effect does using a system analysis and design-based method to help create 
a mobile application for improving reading and comprehension using Philippine Folk Literature 
have? 
According to the survey respondents, 350 out of 453 respondents choose entertaining features that they believe have 
a developmental effect when using a system analysis and design-based approach to create a mobile application for 
improving reading and comprehension using Philippine Folk Literature. Visual aids provide students with realistic 
images and increase their ability to observe with 92% and 72%, students concurring that they eliminate learning 
monotony. This is supported by the study titled Impact of Visual Aids in Enhancing the Learning Process Case 
Research by District Dera Ghazi Khan (2015), as cited in Anas, F. and Zakaria, N. (2019), which can motivate students 
to increase their learning motivation. In addition, based on the interview that the researchers conducted, adapting to 
technology would be a useful instrument for broadening students' understanding in general and enhancing the 
recognition of Philippine folk literature. Adapting to technology would be an effective tool for broadening students' 
comprehension of Philippine folk literature and increasing its appeal. Furthermore, the respondents identified to be 
entertained with an educational game-type application using Philippine folk literature to be the response of their 
children. This will help to develop the interest of the children for a game-type education tool to engage them from 
using it, to further improve their basic skills such as reading and comprehension. 
 
Furthermore, the result of the user acceptable test among the four professionals such as, Filipino teachers (2), 
Literature teacher (1) and a basic education principal (1), as well as the five students are all invited to participate with 
the actual prototype testing of LiteraturaPH to experience it on hand and find out the acceptability of this mobile-
application. According to a survey conducted prior to the application's development, the top 3 features for a system's 
usability, responsiveness, and usefulness, and for a design's quality are comprehension, adaptability, and creativity. 
Age-appropriateness, content, and accuracy of the information quality. The qualities of enjoyable, responsive, and

Abstract 
This research paper aims to develop a mobile application that provides users with a structured approach to 
acquiring local handyman services in their specified location. Using a mixed methods approach and data from 414 
randomly sampled households in Metro Manila, the study identifies Plumbing, Electrical Work, and Carpentry 
Services as commonly requested tasks. Word of mouth is the primary method for finding handymen, while Text 
and Call are preferred for communication. Paying By the day is favored over By the job. Statistical tests were 
used to explore the relationship between challenges and finding, communicating, and paying methods, 
highlighting concerns about verifying handymen's competence and credentials. Location posed challenges such 
as higher transportation fees and delays. Key features were prioritized that inform the design of HandyFix, 
including Location-based Service, Convenient Scheduling, and Issue Submission via Image. User Acceptance 
Testing shows a significant increase in user satisfaction, with the app rated highly for convenience, issue 
resolution, and addressing user challenges. The results demonstrate improved user satisfaction and validate 
HandyFix as an effective and user-friendly platform for acquiring handyman services.

1. Introduction
In the Philippines, the services sector has maintained its position as its main growth driver, contributing to 61% 
of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 57% of employment (National Economic & Development Authority, 
2022). In 2021, 40% of the Philippines’ GDP came from digital products or services, according to a study by 
Microsoft.  Digitalization creates a window of opportunity for the service sector to prosper through on-demand 
applications. It can facilitate digital transactions and interactions, reduce labor requirements, promote inventory 
efficiencies, and cut real estate costs, offering productivity gains. Based on the Visa Consumer Payment Attitudes 
Study, 6 in 10 Filipinos have used on-demand services using apps in the Philippines. According to Harvard 
Business Review, The on-demand app industry is attracting over 22.4 million users annually to spend around 
$57.6 billion to get real-time, location-based services, and they are happy making the payment (Saxena, 2022). 
Customers prefer convenient booking platforms where many service professionals accumulate in a single window. 
According to a study in Indonesia, there are 82% of homeowners have difficulty making an appointment to order 
a handyman service as needed, according to expertise, and on schedule (Nafis 2019). Over the years, it has been 
increasingly challenging to locate and hire a skilled trustworthy handyman service in a community with many 
untrustworthy handymen stealing employees' personal belongings, poor job completion, and a lack of adequate 
skills in performing the task. We see signposts defaced with posters everywhere in Metro Manila (Chua 2019).  
If the home repair and maintenance tasks are not appropriately done, household owners will be unsatisfied and 
may face further issues and hazards in the future. In cases where the emergency is serious such as an electric faulty 
wiring from electronic equipment, this could result in incidents like fire, which would have serious consequences. 
A highly skilled qualified handyman can do the job better as they have the necessary knowledge and the right

application for different age groups. Additional research should explore homeowners' motivations and decision-
making processes for outsourcing home repairs through methods like focus group discussions or interviews. To 
enhance the user experience, the mobile application can incorporate features like a rating and review system, in-
app messaging for direct communication with service providers, and payment options that are widely used in the 
Philippines. Further research on pricing should consider market trends and cost factors to ensure competitiveness 
and profitability.

Abstract 
The study focused on different risks encountered within an automation company such as business, reputational, and 
market risks. The study also included mitigation strategies applied by the organization to counter these identified risks. 
The risks encountered by the company were assessed by the researchers using in-depth interviews, and documented 
observations to get an overview of the overall risk management practices of the company. To collate the data needed 
in conducting the study, the researchers performed qualitative research methods, particularly in-depth interviews to 
three employees coming from different departments. Documented observations within the company premises were 
also included. The data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Literature suggests that this technique is the most 
appropriate method for identifying patterns and themes. Through thematic analysis, the data collected was sorted out 
into different themes to identify the type of risks that belongs to the same cluster. Similar approach was used to identify 
the risk mitigation techniques applied by the company. Results suggest that in business risks, employee retention, 
internal relationship within the organization, the pandemic, and numerous rivals in the industry were the most 
prevailing risk. Among the identified reputational risks were: bad feedback from exiting employees; fake resume 
skills; and not meeting the project deadlines. Further, the identified competition or market risks were: employee 
pirating; having a too common business model; and the high capability of the competitors.

1. Introduction
According to Sraders (2019), risk in general is the possibility that a desired outcome may occur or an undesirable 
outcome may occur instead. Moreover, in a business setting, risk is defined to be a scenario where the expected 
outcome is lesser (Chen  2023). To lessen the likelihood of a risk occurring, risk management must be implemented. 
According to Culp (2020) that the business world is increasingly becoming more volatile in changes and this presents 
a lot of risks and complexity in the business setting. The said event needs to be addressed and risk leaders and managers 
must act proactively to be able to act properly when a problem arises. Kenton (2022) mentioned that a business risk 
is an event that prevents a company from realizing the desired financial outcome. The occurrence of the said type of 
risk can lead to lower profits for an organization. On the other hand, Kenton (2022) said that reputational risk is a type 
of risk that can damage the good name of an entity. One of the greatest concerns with reputational risk is that it can 
happen at any time and can be costly. Conversely, Udealor (2019) said that competitive risk is any actions that a 
competitor can perform to hinder the growth of another entity. The aim of this study is to identify business risks, 
reputational risks, and competitive risks. The study also aims to identify tools used by the organization to give meaning 
to the effects of these risks. Similarly, the study focused on the effect of International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) certification to business outcomes. The researchers utilized qualitative research, particularly in-depth interview. 
Thematic analysis was performed to identify the common themes.

data and provide validation and credibility to the study. A recommended qualitative method that can be used is the 
nominal group technique discussion. The nominal group technique (NGT) is an organized methodology for 
collaborative discussion that promotes contributions from all participants and organizes immediate consensus on the 
relative importance of topics, problems, or solutions (American Society for Quality, n. d.). The nominal group 
technique is good for a more collaborative discussion in tracking down a problem that needs an efficient solution in a 
specific group. The researchers recommend utilizing the nominal group technique since some of the identified risks 
are subject to a specific department that needs to have a group discussion to assess those risks. It is stated by Olsen 
(2019) that Ven and Delbecq (1972) cited that “the nominal group process is a structured meeting which seeks to 
provide an orderly procedure for obtaining qualitative information from target groups who are most closely associated 
with a problem area”. This can be helpful to provide procedural steps in mitigating identified risks. 
 
There were other risks present in a company that the study was not able to identify, future researchers may tackle 
those risks and provide a new risk assessment of the organization. Future researchers may come up with a more 
detailed and comprehensive diagram that shows the process of risk assessment in the company. To further collect 
more detailed and precise data, it is recommended that future researchers may conduct multiple sessions of group 
discussions, observations, and site visits to the company. 
 
The developed theories can be validated through quantitative methods such as conducting surveys and validation from 
experts in those fields. According to Hoover (2021), quantitative data is numerically analyzed to present a statistical 
picture of a trend or connection. The causal relationships may be made clearer by such statistical data. They could be 
used to support or refute the research's primary hypothesis. Whether the outcome is favorable or unfavorable, it can 
cause awareness and movement. Therefore, future researchers are recommended to add quantitative methodology on 
gathering data on the future development of the study.

Abstract 
This research seeks to disseminate the different methods for wastewater treatment in different industries in Latin 
America and Europe, as well as the most used ones. According to the literature reviewed, a large percentage of 
industrial wastewater is not treated, especially in Latin America, causing a negative impact on the ecosystem. There 
are different methods for the treatment of industrial wastewater; however, most of the research on industrial 
wastewater treatment focuses on the study of a single treatment method. The methodology used was the systematic 
literature review, 5 categories and 10 subcategories of study were formed to analyze 30 articles published between 
2015 and 2020. As the main result, it was obtained that green technologies, such as the wetlands method and use of 
microalgae, were the most studied in the last five years. The main limitation of this study was the lack of information 
regarding industrial sectors other than textile and food, so it is suggested to do future research focusing on sectors not 
yet studied, such as automotive, metalworking, agroindustrial, among others.

Wastewater, methods, industrial sector, treatment and Systematic Literature Review. 
Introduction 
Currently, freshwater sources receive everything from large amounts of garbage to invisible chemicals, which can be 
harmful to human and wildlife health (National Geographic 2023). 
Likewise, more than 70% of wastewater is not treated, causing difficulty in completing the water cycle and although 
this problem affects Latin American countries to a greater degree, because they do not have a sufficient supply of 
drinking water (Larios - Meoño et al. 2015), this is not alien to the reality of European countries, as is the case of 
Spain, which is the European nation with the largest water deficit (Rodríguez Fernández Alba et al. n.d., p. 6). 
The lack of controls makes it difficult to know whether the companies actually treat their waste or simply discharge it 
into the water without formalization or a discharge authorization (Zela Esteban and Olivas Aranda. 2022, p.132). 
Similarly, it is estimated that industry acoyunta for 20% of global water consumption and its mismanagement is its 
main problem, since most of the water used is polluted without being purified or made potable again (Nuevas Normas 
ISO  2019). Consequently, according to the described problematic, this paper poses the following research question: 
What research about industrial wastewater treatment has been carried out in Latin America and Europe, between 2015 
and 2020? 
1.1. Objectives 
The purpose of this research is to make known the different methods for wastewater treatment, as well as the most 
used, efficient and sustainable in the industrial sector in Latin America and Europe. In this way, knowledge will be 
provided so that the industrial sector can apply it in their processes, contributing to the reduction of water pollution 
and the continuous improvement of this sector.

The method used for the removal of oils and 
suspended solids in wastewater from washing 
machines and vehicle lubricants was by bioadsorption 
and coagulation-flocculation, achieving a final 
removal of 99.55%. 
The rice husk adsorbent applied in 
the bioadsorption process is not 
sufficient to remove the maximum 
amount of turbidity, so the 
coagulation-flocculation process is 
subsequently applied. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The purpose of this study was to analyze the most commonly used methods for wastewater treatment in different 
industries in Latin America and Europe.  Among the main results of the study, with respect to literary production, it is 
observed that there were more articles published in the years 2019 and 2020. Also, the main methods used for 
wastewater treatment in the industrial sector were wetlands, ozonation, use of microalgae, coagulation and 
flocculation, as they are methods that have been studied more than once. 
 
On the other hand, the main contribution of this research is to provide knowledge about the most efficient and 
sustainable methods used for wastewater treatment so that companies in any industrial sector can apply them in their 
processes. This will contribute to the continuous improvement of the industry by reducing costs and pollution of the 
aquatic environment significantly. Finally, the main limitation of the present study was the limited availability of open 
access articles and the lack of information on industrial sectors other than the textile and food sectors, for which reason 
it is suggested that future recommendations be made focusing on factors that have not yet been studied.

Abstract 
The use of renewable energy to minimize the current impacts of climate change has become a global issue that has 
captured the world's attention. The increasing concentration of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, 
in various sectors such as transportation, industry, and others, has led society to start harnessing renewable energy in 
their daily lives. The utilization of renewable energy is closely tied to the role of batteries as energy storage devices. 
Apart from being used in electric vehicles, batteries can also be utilized in power generation systems, information 
technology, and other applications. This has resulted in a wide and diverse battery ecosystem. These conditions require 
battery manufacturers to continuously innovate and develop products to meet market demands while considering the 
preferences of buyers. In general, buyers desire batteries that possess certain criteria, such as long lifespan, high 
capacity, fast charging, affordable prices, environmental friendliness, and recyclability. However, creating products 
that meet these buyer preferences still requires further research and support from relevant parties, primarily due to the 
constraint of high prices of lithium-ion battery raw materials, which consequently affects battery prices. This study 
aims to provide an overview of product and business analysis for the development of lithium-ion batteries in PT. 
Batex, utilizing the technopreneur ship model, SWOT analysis, and Business Model Canvas (BMC). From this 
research, it can be concluded that the technopreneur ship model plays a significant role in the development of products 
and businesses.

6. Conclusion 
In the era of technological advancements, the ecosystem of lithium-ion battery users is expanding, necessitating 
continuous innovation in lithium battery products. However, the development of lithium-ion batteries using 
technopreneurship, business model canvas, and SWOT analysis approaches poses its challenges. This is primarily due 
to the cost of raw materials, particularly nickel, which is still relatively high, resulting in batteries being less affordable 
for the general public. Innovations in lithium-ion batteries need to align with customer requirements, such as 
affordability, high quality, large capacity, long lifetime, and others.

Abstract 
Predictive maintenance is one of the developments of maintenance activities to ensure the continuity of the production 
process, especially for companies with continuous production processes. However, predictive maintenance activities 
require support from other departments, one of which is the availability of spare parts. This study conducted an in-
depth analysis of 11 previous studies regarding joint or integration in predictive maintenance. Based on the results of 
the research, it is known that only a few joint or integration models in predictive maintenance are included in the use 
of a data-based approach to utilize data collected in real-time. Furthermore, this study proposes a framework that can 
be used in developing a data-driven joint predictive maintenance and inventory model of spare parts in multi-
components/ multi spare parts.

1. Introduction
Maintenance is one of the critical activities in the company, especially in companies with continuous production 
processes, to ensure production runs. The smooth production process for companies with continuous production 
processes is very important because unplanned termination of the production process can result in significant losses. 
Maintenance keeps the machine running to reduce the company’s losses from downtime on the machine (Paul et al. 
2022). Therefore, many studies focus on maintenance and how to improve the efficiency of the maintenance process. 
The company’s development towards Industry 4.0 also attracts the development of maintenance. One of the 
developments of Industry 4.0 is real-time performance measurement and production control Alarcón et al. (2021). The 
application of real-time performance measurement and production control in the company determines maintenance 
policies that can be done based on real-time measurements based on the sensors used. One of the developments of 
maintenance policy is predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance uses predictive tools to determine the required 
maintenance actions. Predictive maintenance is famous because it can reduce maintenance activities related to 
maintenance costs and reduce downtime (Motaghare et al. 2018; Wen et al. 2022). Not only that, predictive 
maintenance can also increase productivity and increase efficiency in the use of finance and resources (Dalzochio et 
al. 2020). According to Montero Jimenez et al. (2020), predictive maintenance can reduce maintenance costs by up to 
25-35%, reduce breakdowns by 70-75%, reduce downtime by 35-45%, and reduce production by 25-35%.
Maintenance policies, including predictive maintenance policies, of course, significantly affect the availability of spare 
parts. According to Driessen et al. (2014), the system’s downtime can be divided into two, namely due to diagnosis & 
maintenance time and maintenance delays caused by the unavailability of the resources needed for diagnosis and 
maintenance. So, it can be seen that the resources required, in this case, spare parts, are closely related to maintenance, 
where a shortage of spare parts can cause downtime even though the maintenance policies applied are appropriate. 
As mentioned earlier, maintenance performance is also related to the availability of spare parts. This dependence 
causes maintenance activities within the company to depend on activities supporting the availability of spare parts, 
such as storage activities or procurement of spare parts at the company. Not only related to storage and procurement

taken from the sensor (Liu et al. 2013; Peng & Van Houtum 2016; Bousdekis et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019; Xue et al. 
2022; Liu et al. 2023). If we look at the approach the references used, the entire article uses a model-based approach 
and has yet to enter into a data-driven approach. Most approaches used in solving joint predictive maintenance 
problems produce exact solutions. However, two articles use heuristics (Liu et al. 2019; Yu et al. 2022). 
 
4.2 Discussion Research Challenges 
Based on the results of subchapter 4.1, it can be seen that joint predictive maintenance has developed from inventory 
and production, with the majority of articles in joint predictive maintenance and inventory. The decision variables 
used in joint optimization on predictive maintenance problems are divided into a degradation threshold policy to 
determine maintenance policies up to the maintenance schedule. The inputs in developing problems range from the 
degradation parameters measured in each inspection to the degradation parameters obtained from the sensors in real 
time. The development of input collection shows that research has developed into technological developments where 
degradation parameters have begun to be collected automatically through sensors. However, the data from these 
sensors is then applied to static batch data and fed into the modeling. This can also be seen from using a model-based 
approach in all research that uses a mathematical system to produce heuristic and exact solutions. The application of 
sensors in measuring degradation can become the basis for model development towards a data-driven approach so that 
the prediction process as the basis for policymaking can be more precise. Model development is also expected to be 
increasingly moving towards multi-components/spare parts to pay more attention to the dependencies of 
components/spare parts on real systems, especially for maintenance systems where the interrelation of spare parts can 
affect the performance of the machine and for inventory systems where procurement can provide lower costs when 
ordering in large quantities. 
 
5. Framework for Joint Predictive Maintenance and Inventory of Spare Part 
Based on the research challenges described, a synthesis is carried out to produce a framework for joint predictive 
maintenance of spare parts with a joint between predictive maintenance and inventory. The development carried out 
is in the approach used, which is data-driven using data from sensors collected in real-time. The different approaches 
will cause the methods used to differ where machine learning will be used in this research. The framework of the 
model can be seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Framework of Joint Predictive Maintenance and Inventory Model 
 
Based on the framework, machine learning will be used in the early stages, starting from failure prediction to 
optimizing the predictive maintenance and inventory policies that are carried out. The model will also consider multi-
components/spare parts so that it will affect the maintenance time policy and order time policy. Multi-component 
maintenance time policies will affect maintenance time, where maintenance carried out simultaneously will reduce 
the maintenance cost. Meanwhile, the ordering time policy will also try to combine procurement times to reduce 
procurement time. The model to be developed will then be tested for the energy industry. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This research studies eleven articles that developed an integrated maintenance model, specifically predictive 
maintenance. The discussion on the predictive maintenance integration model is seen in the integrated parts, decision 
variables, cost components, objects, and models used. Based on the discussion, it was identified that little goes into

multi-component objects or spare parts by using a data-driven approach to produce more optimal results, especially 
for joint predictive maintenance and inventory problems. The identification results were then developed into a 
framework to create joint predictive maintenance and inventory of spare part model.

Abstract 
The agricultural sector is one of the main commodities in Indonesia as an agrarian country. One form of Indonesia's 
development is directed towards advanced and efficient agriculture to maximize the output of agricultural 
commodities. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a solution to create smart agriculture in 
Indonesia. Todaytech operates in the field of agricultural land spraying services using drones. Over time, the growth 
of the agricultural drone market will have an impact on the development of the agricultural drone industry. Based on 
these issues, this study aims to identify the study of technopreneurship and innovation systems in the spray drone 
industry to understand the opportunities for developing strategies in commercializing Todaytech's new product in 
response to the innovation measurement of the spray drone market in Indonesia. The tools used to identify the business 
models are the Goldsmith Model, Value Chain, SWOT analysis, and the Business Model Canvas (BMC). The results 
of this study show that the implemented Goldsmith model faces various technical, market, and business challenges. 
These challenges should be considered by technopreneurs in developing relevant innovation systems.

Abstract 
Swappable batteries which are no longer used in electric motorcycles are hazardous waste. So, there is a need to make some 
efforts to extend battery life and process battery waste. The efforts to extend battery life by repairing, refurbishing, 
remanufacturing, and reusing as well as process batteries by recycling are circular businesses. The development of a circular 
battery swap business cannot only be carried out by one company but involves various companies and various stakeholders. 
This study seeks to identify the stakeholders involved in the development of a swappable battery circular business, identify the 
roles of stakeholders and conduct stakeholder mapping. Data collection was carried out through literature studies, observations, 
and in-depth interviews as well as distributing questionnaires. Data is processed using Mende low matrix and interactive 
analysis. The results of the study show that to develop a circular business of electric motorcycle swappable batteries, 30 
stakeholders need to be involved. Stakeholders are mapped into four groups, namely key players, keep informed, keep satisfied, 
and low priority. Stakeholders who are included in the key player category are stakeholders who are the main priority because 
these stakeholders are important stakeholders and have a major influence in the development of circular business. There are 25 
stakeholders included in the key player. The large number of key players shows that circular business development cannot only 
be carried out by one company, it needs to involve various stakeholders. Each stakeholder has a role in developing a circular 
business. Stakeholder roles include policy creator, coordinator, implementer, facilitator, and accelerator. Policies regarding 
battery waste already exist, but these policies need to be evaluated for their effectiveness. Coordination and communication are 
one of the keys to successful circular business development, therefore coordination and communication are always carried out 
and it is necessary to involve all existing stakeholders.

1. Introduction
The Indonesian government is very aggressive in accelerating the development of electric vehicles, one of which is 
an electric motorbike with a battery. Battery charging can be done by charging the battery directly to a power source 
or by exchanging the battery (battery swappable). A swappable battery is a battery that, if the electric power runs out, 
261","Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

minimized through training or education about batteries and battery repair. However, there are still very few 
institutions that provide education regarding batteries and battery repair. 
Stakeholders who act as facilitators are universities and research institutes, mass media, BSN, the ministry of research 
and technology/National Agency for Research and Innovation, the ministry of industry, the ministry of ESDM, the 
ministry of BUMN, and the ministry of transportation. Stakeholders here function to provide facilities in the form of 
equipment, places, ideas, training, and education as well as outreach to support the circular battery swap business. 
Universities have a role in training human resources who are experts in the field of batteries and battery repair. 
Stakeholders who act as accelerators are electric motorcycle consumers, consumers of reused products, consumers of 
recycled material products, suppliers of new cell batteries, suppliers of used cell batteries, BMS suppliers, and 
supporting suppliers. These stakeholders play a role in accelerating the implementation of circular business. 
Consumers have an important role in circular business (Maitre-Ekern and Dalhammar 2019). Consumers are parties 
who use circular business services, the more consumers use circular business services, the more circular business will 
develop. Consumer awareness to use circular business varies. This consumer awareness needs to be continuously 
increased so that consumers are more concerned about the environment and circular business. 
4. Conclusion
Stakeholders are parties involved in the development of a business. To develop a circular swappable battery business, 
stakeholder involvement is required. There are 30 stakeholders involved in the development of the battery swap 
circular business. To facilitate how to manage and serve stakeholders, these stakeholders are mapped into 4 categories, 
namely key players, keep satisfied, keep informed, and low priority. Stakeholders who are key players are stakeholders 
who are the top priority in the development of the swappable battery circular business, this is because stakeholders in 
this position have a high level of interest and a high level of power. Stakeholders included in the key player are the 
President, the coordinating ministry for maritime affairs, the coordinating ministry for the economy, the ministry of 
LHK, the ministry of research and technology/National Agency for Research and Innovation, the ministry of industry, 
the ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, the ministry of BUMN, BUMN (PLN, Pertamina, IBC), electric 
motorcycle manufacturers, swap battery manufacturers, dealers electric motorcycles, electric motorcycle authorized 
repair shops, electric motorcycle conversion repair shops, non-formal electric motorcycle repair shops, battery swap 
exchange stations, battery recycling companies, electric motorcycle consumers, consumers of reused products, 
consumers of recycled material products. Each stakeholder has their own role. Stakeholder roles can be grouped into 
five, namely policy creator, coordinator, implementer, facilitator, and accelerator. Policies regarding battery waste 
already exist, but the effectiveness of these policies needs to be evaluated. Policy makers can imitate policies from 
countries that are already good at handling battery waste.

Abstract 
Sustainable 3D printing creates products made layer by layer that reduce pollution, save energy, save natural resources, 
and are economical and safe for workers, communities, and consumers. These aspects can be applied to the sustainable 
3D printing process by creating a mathematical model to find optimal sustainable 3D printing process parameters. 
This study develops a multi-objective optimization mathematical model to find the optimal solution for sustainable 
3D printing process parameters by considering quality loss. This study involved several decision variables 
representing geometric variables: filament diameter, process variables, printing speed, structural variables, number of 
layers, and layer thickness. This study has three objective functions: minimizing carbon emissions, minimizing waste, 
and minimizing quality loss. The Gamultiobj algorithm (MATLAB) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic 
Algorithm II method are used to search for optimal values for the four objective functions simultaneously. This study 
shows that considering the quality loss function, the optimal values align with reality because it considers the 
variability of quality and potential loss of quality in currency units. 
Keywords

Abstract 
By reducing Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) companies can minimize the duration of system outages and restore 
services promptly, thereby reducing the impact on the business. Typically, in a Contact Centers or IT Service Desk 
environment, once the ticket has been tagged in critical status, a serious issue is identified and defined as a problem 
(e.g., bug or incident, not an enhancement request), this could impact a client or trial’s workflow to the point where 
existing or new revenue is at risk. This research conducted a case study of an actual IT service desk company based 
in Manila, Philippines on how they handled “Critical Tickets” due to system-wide outages or unexpected downtime 
of software products. The identified causes of High MTTR that were based on the data of Fiscal Year 2022 were the 
primary basis. The identified root cause is the following: (1) Not meeting the required Service Level Agreement (SLA) 
for a minimum Average Handling Time of 15 mins. (2) Promptness of the scheduled EOC in acknowledging and 
Responding to Emergency Critical System Alerts. (3) Availability of Dedicated Software Dev Engineers / Product 
Specialists from a different region to respond to Critical Paging Alert. Based on the identified causes, the study 
proposed two major solutions to address the uncontrolled MTTR in responding to Critical Tickets. First, the 
enhancement of the current Customer Relationship Management (CRM) User Interface (UI) by conducting usability 
testing based on the (ISO 9241-11) metrics.  The SUM results of enhanced CRM UI give 6.97 higher compared to the 
existing CRM design. The Effectiveness improved for getting 100% quality, the Efficiency having 90.45% quality, 
and the User-Satisfaction garnering 90.67%. Second, is the implementation of RoboEOC for full automation of the 
paging alerts system replaces the EOC as the main personnel that responds to/acknowledges the ticket once it was 
tagged as critical. This brings a well-automated paging of the concerned team (On-Call Software Engineers / Product 
Specialists) based on the product that was used to file the ticket. RoboEOC also features “Squadcast-On call 
scheduling”. This feature is a way to see who is in charge and when they oversee a specific critical ticket. A workflow 
Simulation using ARENA was also performed to test the newly proposed workflow if it will do a significant change 
in lowering the MTTR and handling time of Engineers/Specialists.

1. Introduction
Human-centric incident ticket management refers to the process of handling and resolving incidents reported by users 
or customers. It involves a systematic workflow to ensure that issues are addressed promptly and efficiently. 
Automating this workflow can bring several benefits and improve overall productivity. Switching the typical human-
centric incident ticket management workflow to automation shall bring several advantages mainly in ticket assignment 
and escalation. Through automation, tickets are assigned to the appropriate individuals or teams responsible for

6. Conclusion  
The System problem being studied in this paper is the Incident Management workflow of FDI in responding to critical 
incidents due to unplanned or unexpected outages or system-wide issues that affect the functionality and reliability of 
the software products. The gathered data was from Fiscal year 2022 (January 2022 to December 2022) wherein 220 
reported tickets have been escalated to critical and it accumulated 1899.97 total hours of downtime and an overall 
MTTR of 8.64. Moreover, an interview and survey of the stakeholders involved in responding to critical tickets give 
more clarity for the main causes of high-resolution time (Mean Time to Recovery) for each critical ticket.   
 
The cause for the Tech Support Tier 1 not to meet the SLA of 15 mins in handling per incident is due to poor usability 
of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, 89% of Class “A” identified tickets can’t be fixed by Tech 
Support Tier 1 and requires functional escalation for the Software development and Product team to fix. Last Fiscal 
Year data shows that 26% of Class “A” identified tickets can’t be resolved by Tier 2 as well and will be tagged as 
critical for functional escalation. In addition, ‘Class A’ tickets requires collaboration with multiple users and IT 
professional of affected firms or companies, and immediate functional are required for the On-call Engineers and 
Specialist to respond. This brings the idea for this study to measure the current CRM UX Usability and create a new 
tagging for Class “A” incidents that will allow Tech Support Tier 1 to escalate a ticket to critical directly for the 
Functional Escalation team, using automated paging alerts. The proposed implementation of RoboEOC “Transforms 
Human Centric Incident Management System to Automation”, before the EOC will need to pull up an Excel Sheet 
online to verify who the On-call Engineers for the specific issues/product that needs to page to be called out. This 
consumes more minutes/hours, most especially if the primary scheduled on-call is not responsive and the EOC will 
need to call out the manager to assign a new responder, or the manager himself/herself can take over. Another highlight 
for RoboEOC is the “Squadcast-On call scheduling”, this is an embedded software, that will allow a few administrators 
to check who is on-call each day, week, or month.  
 
The Emergency On-Call Engineers (human) will be replaced by the RoboEOC (automation) on the new workflow, 
the Emergency On-Call Engineers will not be expected to be the main and initial responder now when the tickets have 
been tagged to Critical, however, they can still monitor the logs, event viewer, and be part of the creation postmortem 
if needed. The current and proposed system was run in arena simulation and the results are shown in Table 10. The 
table shows that the proposed system drastically reduces the number of hours for acknowledging and for the initial 
investigation of critical incidents. The Arena simulation was able to show that the proposed system of improving the 
incident management for lower MTTR for critical tickets can reduce the average completion time by at least 96.24% 
and reduce the average waiting time of 97.81% for the ticket to be resolved. The simulation shows that by 
implementing the proposed system, FDI can feasibly obtain the goal of 5 hours or lower MTTR for each incident 
ticket by the end of Fiscal year 2023.

Abstract 
In a few years, electric vehicles will transition to vehicles that are massively used in transportation activities in order 
to reduce carbon footprint. The Indonesian government is committed to achieving the ‘Net-Zero Emission’ target by 
2060. In its implementation, the existence of electric motor charging infrastructure such as charging stations is one of 
the critical factors in the electric vehicle adoption program. Consumers will feel anxious if their vehicle runs out of 
battery in the middle of their journey before reaching their destination. Therefore, this study focuses on determining 
the location of charging stations in Surakarta City, Central Java, Indonesia which is targeted to be an effective strategy 
in providing a large initiation impact on emission reduction in Central Java Province. This research takes into account 
the placement of locations that are suitable for electric motor users so that the utility of charging stations is optimal 
and able to serve electric motor users in Surakarta City with the minimum travel cost. The method used is it applies 
optimization model: a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to find the optimal locations for new charging 
stations that can maximize the coverage of the demand. This study uses user data, travel routes, and candidate charging 
station location points as data initiation for optimization models. The optimization is run to determine the most optimal 
solution for location of charging stations that consider electric motor users’ travel costs so that the demands can be 
met well.

1. Introduction
Transportation plays a vital role in daily life, especially in countries like Indonesia, where motorcycles are one of the 
most dominant modes of transportation. The Central Statistics Agency (2021) records that the number of operating 
motorcycles in Indonesia has reached 120 million units. This rapid growth will have negative impacts if left 
unaddressed without decisive intervention. Emissions produced by motorcycles contribute to air quality degradation, 
as well as increased greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global climate change. Therefore, innovation in 
electrifying motorcycles is necessary to prevent these issues, in line with the Indonesian government's commitment to 
achieve 'Net-Zero Emission' by 2060.

6. Conclusion  
A supply chain network model has been devised to address the placement of electric vehicle charging stations within 
Surakarta City. This model is executed with the incorporation of several crucial factors, including the travel routes 
undertaken by electric motorcycle users across the city, the distribution of public facilities, population density data 
per neighborhood, and the identified potential charging station locations. Through this comprehensive model, 
invaluable insights are furnished to the local government, aiding them in making well-informed decisions regarding 
the optimal positioning of E-Motorcycle charging stations. 
 
Nevertheless, it's essential to acknowledge a limitation inherent in this model. Namely, the current model does not 
encompass variables linked to the behavior of electric motorcycle users. As such, further research endeavors should 
address these limitations by employing a dynamic simulation model. Such an approach would allow for the inclusion 
of factors like queuing and charging time, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy and effectiveness in determining 
the locations for Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (PEVCS). This refinement would offer a more holistic 
perspective and contribute to the model's applicability and real-world relevance.

Abstract 
The use of electric motorcycle-battery swapping stations (EM-BSS) is one of the efforts to accelerate the adoption of 
electric motorcycles in Indonesia. The EM-BSS system can be viewed as a digital supply chain (DSC) that utilizes 
Internet of Things (IoT) technology to carry out system activities. The system certainly deals with the issue of supply 
chain operational vulnerability, which is a concern for supply chain practitioners today. A causal inference approach 
is used to estimate the supply chain operational vulnerability level. The first step in using the causal inference approach 
is to create a structural causal model based on the expert knowledge domain. Structural causal modeling started with 
identifying vulnerability indicators: consequences, drivers, and threat sources. The vulnerability indicator on the EM-
BSS system obtained 12 vulnerability performance indicators as consequences, 21 vulnerability drivers, and four 
potential threat sources.

Abstract 
The development of a tourist village is one of the solutions to drive the regional economy and a realization of the 
Master Plan for Tourism Development. This has prompted the government to target as many as 244 tourist villages 
by 2024. One strategy in this development is through a potential assessment related to the level of readiness of the 
tourist village. In this regard, this research focuses on designing an assessment measuring instrument from Wonorejo 
Village, which has a lot of natural potentials, but its development has not been directed and runs effectively. The 
novelty of this research is to design an assessment measuring instrument using the criteria in the Director General of 
Forest Protection and Nature Conservation Guidelines of 2003 related to the assessment of natural tourism potential 
and Central Java Governor Regulation No. 53 of 2019 regarding the guidelines for assessing tourist villages. The two 
guidelines are then merged into a tourism model according to the principle of the tourism production function from 
Smith (1994), which views tourism as a product so that all supporting elements such as resources and facilities can be 
considered explicitly and outputs in the form of services and experiences are obtained in a structured manner. The 
input for this assessment is based on a survey of the relevant stakeholders. Based on the results of the assessment, a 
total value of 59% was obtained, which indicates that Wonorejo Village is included in a developing tourism village. 
Then the variables were selected cumulatively based on the lowest achievement which is intermediate output included 
10 sub-variables which became the basis for developing strategy recommendations.

1. Introduction
Tourism plays a crucial role in driving the economy of a country. According to survey results, Indonesia is ranked as 
the top tourist destination in the world. Therefore, the government plays a vital role in formulating tourism 
development policies to ensure that both the local community and tourists adhere to the established regulations and 
policies. The government's role is outlined in various regulations, both at the national level with the vision of Indonesia 
becoming a world-class tourist destination that is competitive, sustainable, and capable of driving regional 
development and the welfare of the people. This vision is reinforced by local regulations that are in line with the 
national objectives. 
Based on the background of the problem, this study aims to design a measurement tool for assessing the natural tourism 
village, with a specific focus on the case study of Wonorejo Village in Jatiyoso Subdistrict, Karanganyar Regency. 
The measurement tool is expected to serve as a basis for evaluating the potential of realizing the government's master 
plan for developing tourism potential through the concept of a tourism village, taking into consideration the natural 
tourism potential of Wonorejo Village, which is located in a protected forest area. Additionally, based on observations, 
Wonorejo Village already offers several tourism packages, accommodations, and developing infrastructure. 
The assessment process related to the readiness of the natural tourism village will be designed by developing a model 
that is validated with relevant regulations. Thus, the novelty of this research lies in developing the Smith model (1994)

6. Conclusion 
The measurement tool is designed using research variables that include the assessment variables for tourism villages 
based on Central Java Governor Regulation No. 53 of 2019 and the Guidelines for ADO-ODTWA (Tourism 
Destination Area-Natural Resource Conservation Area) issued by the Directorate General of Conservation of Natural 
Resources in 2003. The framework or model used to map these regulations is the Tourism Production Function, as 
proposed by Smith in 1994.The assessment value for the readiness of Wonorejo Village to become a natural tourism 
village is 60%, while the assessment value as a natural tourism village itself is 59%. This means that if Wonorejo 
Village applies and is accepted by the Karanganyar Regency Government, it will be classified as a developing tourism 
village. 
 
The proposal is made to increase the readiness level of Wonorejo Village for registration as a natural tourism village 
and to elevate its tourism village category to an advanced level. The proposal to enhance the readiness level for 
registration involves creating technical documents that have not been fulfilled, such as tourism potential documents 
and a Disaster Management Plan (RPB). Meanwhile, the proposal to upgrade the category from a developing tourism 
village to an advanced tourism village can be achieved by improving the achievement values of the sub-variables in 
the assessment. Based on the percentage achievements represented by the radar diagram, the lowest value is found in 
the Intermediate Output process. Within this process, there are a total of 10 sub-variables that require improvement. 
This proposal is analyzed using the 5W+1H method to facilitate stakeholders in making decisions.

Abstract 
The electric vehicle market, especially motorcycles, in Indonesia is expected to grow rapidly 
supported by various applicable laws and infrastructure that is continuously being developed by 
the Government of the Republic of Indonesia. This will pose a serious threat to sustainability, 
namely an increase in the number of used batteries if not managed properly. If used batteries are 
managed properly, it will be able to minimize the negative impacts that arise, and there is even an 
economic potential that can be achieved. This paper discusses the opportunities for utilizing used 
motorcycle batteries in Indonesia using a circular supply chain approach. Used battery 
management using this approach can even overcome the unavailability of proper national lithium 
mines, by ""mining"" lithium from used batteries. The management of used batteries will bring up 
many related new businesses and promises to achieve sustainability goals well.

Abstract 
This article aims to verify the technological feasibility of installing a workshop for the production of typical caporal 
costumes based on the Cellular Manufacturing methodology. By taking samples of times used in the production 
process, the standard times of each activity were obtained considering constant and variable supplements resulting 
from the different conditions to which the operators are exposed. It was determined that, under the chosen 
methodology, the process needs 6 operators and 8 machines to cover the projected demand of 897 suits per month, 
with a production capacity of 17.89 suits per day. Finally, a u-shaped distribution of the workshop was proposed, 
which maintains a constant flow within the process and allows exploiting the versatility of the workers.

1. Introduction
Culturally, it has been demonstrated that Peru is one of the most diverse countries in America and the world, with a 
great variety of traditions throughout its regions, cities, and towns. The culture of each people is expressed through 
music, costumes, dances and more (Sandoval et al. 2014). Peru has as a cultural heritage of humanity the ""Festivity 
of the Virgin of Candelaria"" which is celebrated every year during the month of February in the department of Puno. 
This celebration includes masses, contests, parades, and other activities carried out throughout the month, has the 
participation of more than 170 dance groups with approximately 40,000 dancers in total (United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO] n.d.). 
Like many festivities in the country, the dancers use folkloric costumes in the programmed activities, generating a 
demand. These costumes, which stand out for being bright and colorful, are designed individually by each ensemble, 
with different colors, designs, and meanings (Podjajcer et al. 2009). Because of these factors the demand for costumes, 
mainly for the Diablada, Morenada and Caporales dances, is accompanied by a constant search for quality and reliable 
delivery times. Currently, these costumes are handmade; that is, each unit is made and embroidered by hand. This 
work is an accepted and valued method by the clients; however, on many occasions, there are problems in their 
deliveries due to a lousy measurement of the production time required for the requested demand and, in some cases, 
there are defects in the suits due to bad seams or manufacturing defects. 
The present study seeks to find the appropriate technology for its manufacture, which should be adapted to the demand 
requirements. Based on the market segmentation of the project, it was determined that the demand for caporal 
costumes in the first year is 2,386 units, which could increase to 4,159 units in the fifth year of operation.

4. Conclusion 
Finally, the Multiple Operations Diagram was made, considering the times and activities performed by each operator 
and the sequence of these. As a result, obtaining a production of 17 suits per day, meeting the demand of 897 suits per 
month calculated for the study and a daily productivity of 2.98 suits per operator. The results are show in Figure 5. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Layout of dressmaking workshop 
 
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the key factors for the proposed layout of the workshop were the 
number of operators and the number of machines needed to cover the monthly demand, for which it is necessary to 
have multipurpose operators. With a total of 6 operators and 8 machines, it is possible to cover the monthly demand 
of 897 caporal suits per month, with a production of 17.89 suits, a takt time of 26.81 minutes and a cycle time of 47.73 
minutes.

Abstract 
The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused an unexpected surge in online shopping, resulting in a higher growth rate than 
initially anticipated. From 2020 to 2022, there has been an additional 10% increase in growth, and from 2023 to 2025, 
there is projected to be an additional 3% increase, leading to a market worth $50 billion by the end of 2025. The 
pandemic has prompted numerous businesses to enter the e-commerce market, which is predicted to dominate 80% 
of the retail sector by 2030. The global changes in consumer behavior due to COVID-19 have accelerated the 
dominance of e-commerce in the retail industry. This study aims to examine the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on 
the electronic market in Saudi Arabia. A literature review was conducted, and survey questionnaires were distributed, 
collected, and analyzed using statistical techniques. E-commerce companies have implemented various consumer-
friendly features to attract more customers, including diverse product ranges, customer ratings and reviews, discounted 
deals, affordable delivery options, free exchanges and returns, competitive pricing, and 24/7 availability. The strong 
purchasing power driven by high per capita income, improved logistics networks, and increasing internet penetration 
are the primary factors contributing to the growth of e-commerce in Saudi Arabia.

Abstract 
Railways logistics have been developed since the 19th century; however, until today, utilizing the 
characteristics of the railway to provide a sustainable supply of raw materials has not been fully 
Exploited. To the industrial regions, the logistics hub increases the efficiency of its supply chain.  
Supplying raw materials from the logistics hub to the industrial areas grants cost reduction, reliability 
of the manufacturer’s material supply, positively affecting production capacity, restocking interval 
time, and social and environmental responsibility. This study aims to highlight the benefits of railway 
logistics to enhance the economy and improve operational capacity. This research used a mixed 
method to highlight critical elements of railway freight characteristics and compared them to truck 
freight characteristics to view the limitation of each approach to decide the optimal solution for the 
case via cost, environment, social economy, and future potential. The outcomes of this study will be 
valuable to both the industry manufacturers and the economy.

1.0 Introduction 
The industrial sector flourished in Saudi Arabia as it is one of the leading countries in the oil industry 
and its subsidiaries. Transportation has always been the backbone of the economy, enabling the 
movement of materials and goods from one place to another. Currently, the most transportation 
modes used are sea freight and truck transportation. This research presents the potential of using 
railways to support the industrial sectors due to the need for a high-capacity vessel for long distances 
and a relatively lower cost. Each mode of transportation has unique advantages that can benefit the 
industrial sector. Multi-modal transportation modes will utilize each mode’s advantages and 
compensate for its limitations. This research will study the feasibility of adding the railways’ 
transportation and compare it with the other used methods in the industrial sector. When evaluating 
337","8 
Manufacturers in the industrial region saw a potential to expand their market share and less workload 
in inventory with more control in effectively replenishing their stock level. The cost of transportation, 
asset management, and the stakeholder responsible for private investment or government, pricing, 
and regulation. Factors mentioned by the Manufacturer's consideration are pricing, stakeholders in 
transportation management, the facilitation of changing transportation methods from railways hub 
to trucks to reach their facilities and loading time. 
The government sector replies to The proposal to lessen the cost of road maintenance and handling 
the traffic caused by trucks and new income by placing new regulations and fares for using road 
transportation, promoting using the railways and contributing to the vision of 2030 for environmental 
responsibility and more alternative income. The infrastructure cost and the route planning of the rail 
network, the management of transportation mode under direct government control or put into the 
private investment of a third party. Factors to consider in implementing new transportation methods: 
pricing and regulations, limiting road transportation to minimize truck usage. 
 
5.0 Conclusion and Recommendation: 
Transportation cost is a vital factor in the economy. The research objective is to highlight the optimal 
mixture of transportation alternatives to minimize the total logistics cost We have a grand vision for 
our logistics initiative, where our railway system effortlessly connects every corner of our beautiful 
nation. By carefully planning and executing our strategy, we can unite diverse communities and 
unlock new opportunities for all. Collaborating closely with neighboring countries will allow us to 
unleash even more significant potential, building a brighter future for future generations. As we 
move forward, we will expand our railway network in phases, with the interconnected phases two 
and three reaching even further. We also aim to establish mutually beneficial commercial 
partnerships with our neighbors. 
As we begin our logistics initiative, we envision a future where our railway system effortlessly links 
every part of our wonderful nation. By meticulously planning and executing our strategy, we can 
unite diverse communities and open new opportunities for everyone. Furthermore, we can unleash 
even more significant potential through strategic collaborations by working alongside our 
neighboring countries to build a brighter future. 
As our logistics initiative takes shape, we intend to expand our railway network in phases, with 
phases two and three interconnecting and expanding further. Additionally, we aim to negotiate 
profitable commercial partnerships with our neighboring countries.

Abstract 
For many items, decisions related to supply chain management have not been an easy task. It is then much more 
complex for perishable items than the other. Besides cost-efficiency, other factors, such as customer expectation and 
product freshness, have significant contributions to competitive advantages and business’s reputation. In other words, 
it would be flawed to care about either cost or profit ignoring other objectives. A multi-objective model for such items 
is, thus necessary. In this regard, this study introduces an integrated network design and inventory optimization model 
considering a perishable supply chain from a sustainable perspective. The mathematical model is to maximize profit, 
minimize the freshness loss of products at the point of demand fulfillment, and minimize the solid waste stress of the 
supply chain. In the result analysis, a numerical case is used to demonstrate the model utilization and the decision-
making process. Max-Min Operator is to solve a multi-objective model. The model resulting shows tradeoffs among 
the objectives. Additionally, decision-makers can observe influences of the environment and society along with the 
economy on supply chain-related decisions, and vice versa.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management for perishable items such as foods and biological-based products is the topic that has 
received research attention recently, especially in the context of inventory management. During the past few years, 
inventory optimization has been one of the important tools allowing decision makers to achieve economic inventory 
management plans while being able to pursue service-level and other management objectives. When considering 
customers as the main stakeholder, the incorporation of customer satisfaction in inventory planning can be regarded 
as the attempt to strengthen supply chain’s social sustainability performance. To contribute to this interesting research 
field, this study develops a multi-objectives inventory optimization model for perishable products. The development 
of an inventory plan for perishable products is a complex task as the plan needs to account for not only the shelf life 
but also the demand-fulfillment ability of the remaining products and spoilage. On the other hand, finding suitable 
inventory planning is always a great opportunity to improve the profit and reduce loss. In this study, we present the 
case where customers perceive the positive social impacts of inventory control that maximize the freshness of products 
at the point of their demand fulfillment. The proposed model helps decision-makers determine optimal order quantity 
and order frequency in terms of costs and freshness level consideration. 
Additionally, the model simultaneously takes into account network design problem. Traditionally, this problem is to 
identify the location to build facilities and warehouses in order to maximize the overall performance of the supply 
chain. Companies nowadays start thinking about the interaction between network design and other decisions, 
especially the inventory planning. When and how much products are placed to store in the warehouses in conjunction 
with how to design the distribution networks to optimize the profit and customer satisfaction. At the same time, 
decisions should benefit to environmental and social responsibilities of the network. As mentioned before, the 
proposed model considers multi-objectives relating to the sustainability goals. If the inventory optimization problem

Abstract 
In recent years, plastic has been part of the value chain of many different products, becoming a final consumer good. 
The enormous value of the plastics industry is beneficial for those who are part of the chain, reflected in the enormous 
figure of 1 trillion dollars a year, that is, 5% of the total trade of goods worldwide. This research is oriented to examine 
3 tools to achieve a new model to optimize and improve the level of service, due to late delivery times and poor quality 
identified as the main problems within the company studied. The proposed model uses tools such as: Improvement of 
mold change time through the SMED Engineering tool, improvement of the organization and production tools through 
the 5S Engineering tool and improvement of operational efficiency under a Total Productive Maintenance approach 
obtaining an improvement for the company. Achieving an integrated model to improve the level of service that is 
suitable to be replicated in manufacturing companies.

1. Introduction
The plastics industry has an important effect on the world economy: an average consumer uses different items made 
of plastic daily, either for personal consumption or in productive activities such as construction, communications, 
transportation, storage. The versatility of plastic provides its rapid integration to any productive process or final 
product, which is the reason why the plastic industry currently holds an outstanding place in world economies 
(Góngora 2014) Within the Latin American context, demand greatly exceeds the industry's supply, which is why 
maximizing production ensures the sector's sales. Latin America accounts for 4.4% of world production, being the 
region with the highest production above the Independent States. In Peru, production also shows an annual growth of 
3.2%, which makes it the fifth most innovative activity in the country; more than one million tons of plastic raw 
materials are imported annually. (SIN 2019). In addition to the above, the sector obtained a percentage growth of 
31.5% of registered companies, with a predominance of small and medium-sized companies that represent 73% of the 
total number of companies, being these companies the ones that contribute the most value in the chain (Schrewe 1981). 
According to the literature research on plastic companies in Peru, one of the main problems in this sector is the high 
percentage of waste, which has an economic impact on the companies in this industry. Most of this is due entirely to 
the lack of management methods, practices and procedures or a standardization plan. 
These problems have also been identified in several case studies. For example, an investigation conducted in a 
Peruvian company in the plastics sector identified the problem of machine failure with a 56.15% impact, due to 
inadequate calibration parameters and inadequate use of personnel (Flores et al. 2020) Another case study conducted 
in a Peruvian manufacturing company detected problems of low productivity, quality, and machine downtime 
(Raymundo  2020). On the other hand, the case of Productivity Latin America was identified, a company in the plastics

Component three applies the tools described in the model. The fourth component is based on a re-evaluation of 
indicators with the objective of measuring the KPIs previously established in the implementation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
After the present study, it is concluded that the application of Lean Manufacturing methods can lead to the 
improvement in the improvement of production process times in a company of the plastic sector. An improvement is 
evidenced in the final indicators compared to the initial ones. The service level went from 56% to 90.4%, surpassing 
the target service level. Through the use of the Pareto diagram and the analysis of causes, it became evident that the 
two main causes of the low level of service were the late delivery time with a percentage of 71% and the low quality 
with 22%.  
 
When analyzing the main root causes, it was concluded that the production area was affected by high unproductive 
times caused mainly by the delay in mold changes, as well as the disorder and lack of organization in the work area. 
Therefore, with the improvement proposal using the Lean methodology and TPM in the simulation, it was possible to 
improve the mold change times in the production area where the heating and blowing process is performed, obtaining 
a result of 43.07 minutes compared to the initial situation of 59.06 minutes, all this in relation to the unproductive time 
within the area improved with the SMED tool theoretically. The correct application of the 5s in the production area 
would achieve an improvement in the organization and distribution of work tools in the area achieving a cycle time 
of 152.58 minutes versus the initial situation of 164.69 minutes, according to the scientific articles investigated. 
In summary, the level of service increased by 34.4%. With respect to economic losses, there were fines due to non-
compliance with orders. Through the implementation of Lean and TPM tools, a total of 9,973 soles could be saved 
annually with respect to the current situation. The simulation model was validated in Arena software. The results 
obtained in the final situation show a favorable environment for the companies of the plastic sector, since with the 
proposed model an efficiency of 90.13% of the process was achieved.

Abstract 
Central Analytical Laboratory, Johor Plantations Berhad implemented the Six Sigma (SS) approach to obtain 
performance in terms of cost, quality, and productivity. This paper aims to implement SS in the laboratory to mitigate 
the high variance in turnaround time (TAT) of fertilizer analysis. The DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyse-Improve-
Control) strategy was employed as the model of problem-solving during the SS execution. A team compromising of 
2 chemists, 12 analysts, and 5 general workers was formed to carry out the project. In this project, we found that 
multiple variables could contribute to the high numbers of variance in the TAT of the fertilizer analysis. In a phased 
manner, the team under the guidance of the chemist as the team leader has been able to utilize the power of simple 
tools such as Process Mapping, Ishikawa Diagram, SIPOC, Affinity Diagram, and others, to find root causes and take 
corrective actions during implementations process. Consequently, there was a significant reduction in the variance of 
TAT, decreasing from 2.741 days in 2021 and 2.433 days in 2022 to 1.420 days. The mean TAT also exhibited positive 
improvement, decreasing from 6.956 days in 2021 and 2.433 days in 2022 to a new mean of 3.018 days.

1. Introduction
According to Malaysia Palm Oil Board (2022), the Malaysian oil palm industry is valued at billions of Ringgits, with 
5.67 million hectares of plantations contributing to export revenues of RM137.89 billion. Johor Plantations Berhad 
(JPB) is a subsidiary company of Kulim (Malaysia) Berhad and is prominently engaged in oil palm plantations. With 
a total planted area of 60,339 hectares, JPB is recognized as one of the key players in Malaysia's palm oil industry 
(Kulim (Malaysia) Berhad  2022). 
Fertilizer plays a crucial role in enhancing the growth and productivity of oil palm as their utilization play a significant 
impact on the overall success of oil palm plantations (Sudradjat et al. 2018). Notably, fertilizers constitute a substantial 
portion of the total production costs in oil palm plantations typically making up around 30% for immature palm and 
up to 60% for mature palm (Lifianthi & Husin 2012). Hence, ensuring quality control in the purchasing of fertilizers 
is of utmost importance. 
Central Analytical Laboratory, Johor Plantations Berhad (CAL) is responsible for ensuring the quality control of 
fertilizers purchased by JPB. Accredited with ISO/IEC 17025, CAL conducts rigorous testing and analysis to verify 
fertilizer quality, not only for internal use but also as an external service for industry stakeholders. Turnaround time 
(TAT) has become one of the key performance indexes (KPI) for CAL to ensure the smooth running of the plantation’s 
operations.

5. Conclusion 
This project demonstrates the effective application of the Six Sigma DMAIC strategy in reducing the variance of the 
turnaround time (TAT) from 2.741 days (2021) and 2.433 days (2022) to 1.420 days. Additionally, there was a 
significant improvement in the mean TAT, which decreased from 6.956 days (2021) and 5.023 days (2022) to 3.018 
days. The implementation of DMAIC tools within the framework of the Six Sigma methodology has played a vital 
role in improving TAT performance. Four underlying causes of high variance in TAT were identified during the 
process, and six solutions were implemented to address these issues. Furthermore, three control procedures were 
executed to ensure the sustained effectiveness of the implemented solutions over time. This study has demonstrated 
that the application of Six Sigma is a practicable strategy to improve laboratory TAT and that can be used for other 
quality improvement in similar settings.

Abstract 
This study described the challenges of Philippine Higher Education Institutions in using the Philippine Quality Award 
(PQA) framework and identified opportunities for improvement as bases for action plans. The study delved into 
various dimensions, including senior leadership, governance, societal responsibilities, strategy development, strategy 
implementation, the voice of the customer, customer engagement, measurement, analysis, and improvement of 
organizational performance, knowledge management, information, and information technology, workforce 
environment, workforce engagement, work processes, operational effectiveness, product and process results, 
customer-focused results, workforce-focused results, leadership and governance results, and financial and market 
results. The study included 150 out of 177 (84.75%) senior leaders from private and public Higher Education 
Institutions (HEIs) who had received Level 1 recognition of the Philippine Quality Award from 2005 to 2021. The 
researcher adopted the Philippine Quality Award (PQA) evaluation tool. The study revealed that most respondents are 
affiliated with private autonomous colleges operating for 40 to 50 years with notable achievements in quality assurance. 
Respondents face some challenges in Categories 3.1 - Voice of the Customer, 7.5 - Budgetary, Financial, and Market 
Results, and 5.2 - Workforce Engagement. Finally, to help HEIs improve at the PQA level, the researcher identified 
actionable insights through opportunities for improvements based on the findings and results of the study, which can 
serve as bases for action planning of educational institutions.

1. Introduction
The Philippine Quality Award (PQA) Program was created by Republic Act 9013, which former President Fidel V. 
Ramos signed into law on February 28, 2001 (Republic Act No. 9013 | GOVPH 2001). The PQA Criteria for 
Performance Excellence serve as a framework to monitor, analyze, and improve an organization's performance. They 
are based on the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program of the United States. The National Institute for Standards 
and Technology (NIST) established the Baldrige National Award program in 1987, focusing on manufacturing, 
services, and small enterprises. Since then, it has expanded to include educational management practices (Young, 
2002; Halloran 2008). 
However, there is a lack of literature specifically dedicated to the PQA, with most studies primarily referencing 
Malcolm Baldrige. To address this gap, the researcher undertook a comprehensive study encompassing all PQA 
categories and examined each requirement within these seven categories. 
The PQA program evaluates organizations by examining their performance and continuous improvement mechanisms. 
It considers their approaches to key process categories (Categories 1-6) and their results (Category 7). The PQA 
criteria for performance excellence are structured around seven categories: leadership, strategy, customers, 
measurement, analysis, and knowledge management, workforce, operations, and results.

6. Conclusion  
The respondents demonstrate remarkable ease in meeting the requirements of the PQA but encounter minimal 
challenges and difficulties in specific Criteria Items such as 3.1 – Voice of the Customer, 7.5 – Budgetary, Financial, 
and Market Results, 5.2 – Workforce Engagement, 2.2 – Strategy Implementation, and 4.1 – Measurement, Analysis, 
and Knowledge Management. Considering the opportunities for improvement emphasized in this study, essential 
strategies have been recommended as a basis for action planning among higher education institutions.

Abstract 
This paper describes the various steps accomplished to implement the design and construction of an additional 
bathroom with an existing building in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The process of developing floor plans, getting approvals 
from the city, hiring contractor(s), stepwise building, and getting inspections done by the city authorities at various 
stages of the building process, has been outlined in detail.  This sequence of steps can serve as a good case study for 
architectural engineering students and can provide useful materials for faculty members teaching such courses.

Project Portfolio Management in the Digital Era for 
Organizational Strategy Execution and  
Sustainable Development

Abstract 
Delivering a sustainable organizational strategy in the digital terrain has proven difficult for many organizations. 
Lately, organizations and governments are perplexed by the dynamic environment of unprecedented changes 
resulting from the digital transformation brought along by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), and sustainable 
development visions that are necessary for the future. Through a descriptive study, using both qualitative data 
from literature and quantitative data collected from 56 project management professionals, the study concludes that 
there is a need to intensify research and development in the areas of digital migration and sustainable development 
through project portfolio management to promote the execution of organizational objectives that seek to advance 
digital transformation and sustainable development initiatives and also to increase research output on such subjects 
in project management-related studies.

Introduction 
There is a need to advance the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN 2023a), and using project 
portfolio management to advance the implementation of the UN’s objectives in this digital terrain, through 
organizational objectives could assist organizations in bridging the chasm between their strategy formulation and 
its implementation. Projects are modus-operant for change. Organizations implement projects to effect changes 
that seek to add sustainable value to the organization. Often aiming to achieve set organizational objectives and 
goals, organizations allocate limited resources to implement projects to bring about change that delivers value 
whilst creating sustainability for the organization and the universe at large.  
Project Portfolio Management (PPM) as a tool for the management of projects and programs in organizations has 
been in use for decades to assist organizations in planning the formulation and delivery of projects and programs 
that are aligned with organizational strategic visions (Hobbs 2012; Voss and Kock 2013). The PPM model equips 
an organization with the structure, tools, and techniques that are necessary to ensure that the right projects and 
programs are in place for sustaining and growing the business, and that change priorities are balanced with 
resources and capability to deliver such changes consistently and well. It connects the execution of an 
organization’s projects to the fulfilment of strategy. 
The digital world brought along by Fourth Industrial Revolution has revolutionized the global economy and 
changed how people perceive and experience human and environmental development. With much-developed 
technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT), the world is 
now experiencing dynamic changes that are brought along by 4IR technologies (Whyte 2019). The PPM model 
is becoming increasingly important to keep up with global changes and also prepare organizations for current and 
future trajectories.   
On the other side, the call for global sustainable development is increasingly becoming critical. The world is now 
in greater need of transformational work that leads to sustainability by curbing climate change and reducing 
poverty (UN  2023a). United Nations describes global sustainability as the security of the future for the entire 
ecosystem. It is through the global sustainability phenomenon that organizations must act now, instead of later in 
delivering projects and programs that are aligned with the United Nations’ (UN) futuristic goals of sustainable

LPG Cylinder Delivery Authentication using Artificial 
Intelligence in Last Mile Delivery 
Prithvirajan D and Mathirajan M 
Department of Management Studies

Bangalore 560012 
Abstract 
Last Mile Delivery (LMD) relates to all activities in delivering the product to the end customer in the supply chain. 
Safe, secure, and on-time delivery of products to customers are the primary objectives of businesses rendering 
LMD services. LPG cylinder distribution in India is one such business that provides LMD to its subscribed 
customers through delivery agents employed by distributors. Despite being an essential commodity, there is no 
system to confirm or authenticate the delivery. This absence of the system required for authentication causes a 
rise in black-market deviation, negatively affecting the distributor's reliability and customer satisfaction. To the 
best of our knowledge, there is no research towards developing an authentication system for delivery confirmation 
in LMD of LPG cylinders. Against this backdrop, this study proposes a secure, reliable, cost-effective Delivery 
Authentication System (DAS) using artificial intelligence and image metadata. The proposed DAS has an image 
classifier module built using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and a metadata processing module to extract 
geolocation. A sample image dataset of an LPG cylinder and objects which looks similar to an LPG cylinder was 
used to train the image classifier. A prototype DAS with MobileNet V2 CNN architect is developed using Python 
and Keras library. With the data augmentation technique, we could train our CNN with a small dataset and prevent 
it from underfitting. The transfer learning technique helped our CNN to generalize well on the study data without 
overfitting and produced an accuracy score of 97%.  The expected outcome of this study is to reduce black-market 
deviation cases and to improve the distributor's reliability as well as the customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Essential commodities are those whose supply, if disrupted, would negatively affect the harmony in society. In
India, such products are protected under the Essential Commodities Act. Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders 
or cooking gas cylinders is one of the essential commodities in India. These LPG cylinders are delivered to
customers by delivery agents employed by distributors selected by petroleum companies. In India, Indian Oil
Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation
Limited (HPCL) are the major stakeholders in LPG cylinder distribution. When a customer orders, the distributor
assigns the job to the deliveryman rendering service to the customer’s residential area. The delivery man delivers
the cylinder to the customer’s doorstep, collects the empty cylinder and payment, and provides the customer with
a cash memo (order bill).
The cash memo has two sections, one for an office copy, where the customer or the receiver on behalf of the 
customer must attest, and a customer copy. After receiving the attestation from the customer, the deliveryman 
proceeds to the next delivery. It is to be noted that the distributor or the petroleum company does not authenticate 
the attestation provided by the receiver in any instance and is only a formality. Also, the customers attesting the 
office copy of the cash memo do not always attest properly. This naïve current practice has paved the path for the 
increase in case of black-market deviations, where the deliveryman will sell the cylinder in the black market. In 
this situation, the customer will wait for his order to be delivered, and the distributor cannot track the order status. 
This increases customer complaints regarding delivery delays, negatively affecting the distributor’s reliability and 
causes inventory accounting problems for the distributors. The black-market deviation is a significant threat to 
businesses involved in LMD. With this background it is evident that a fast, secure, reliable, and cost-effective 
Delivery Authentication System (DAS) ensures the customers have received their orders and the distributors have 
an account for the number of cylinders outbound from the warehouse and the number of cylinders delivered. In 
this study one such DAS is developed using artificial intelligence and image meta-data.

6. Conclusion 
This study addresses the issue of black-market deviation in the LMD of LPG cylinders in India by proposing a 
prototype DAS. The proposed DAS is developed using Artificial Intelligence and Image Metadata. The Image 
Classifier model was developed using the transfer learning technique with MobileNetV2 neural network 
architecture. The data augmentation technique has enabled to train the proposed model even with a small dataset. 
The model’s accuracy, f1-score, and confusion matrix indicated that the model has generalized well. One of the 
very important research components: “comparative analysis of delivery authentication system (DAS) and 
geographic authentication system (GAS) in terms of both storage and computational memory utilization,” is yet 
to be analyzed and is under progress of the research agenda towards the thesis/dissertation work of the first author 
of this paper.

A Comparative Analysis of Heuristic Methods for  
Facility Location and Allocation of Buses to Facilities  
in Urban Road Transportation Systems

Abstract 
The city buses operating in the Urban Road Transportation Systems (URTS) cover various non-revenue generating distances 
without carrying passengers. One such distance travelled from a facility in the early morning to starting point of first trip 
and ending point of last trip back to the facility in the late evening is the 'dead kilometers or mileage' (DK). Since the 
mileage per unit of the fuel varies, minimizing DK cost (DKC) associated with allocation of city buses to facility (ACBF) 
problem is an ideal objective than minimizing DK. This DKC is directly affected by the location of the facilities and 
assignment of each of the buses to a specific facility. Due to continuous growth of any metro-city and commuters of city-
buses, the number of city-buses need to be increased. Further, due to environmental and logistic reasons, a few existing 
facilities need to be closed. Due to this there is a need to open new facilities. For closing the existing facility(s), a salvage 
cost is incurred and for opening new facility(s), fixed cost is incurred. So, in any URTS, there is facility location (FL) 
problem for opening and/or closing facility(s).  
Further, FL and ACBF problems are inseparable as DKC is the common cost affecting the decisions associated with each 
of these decision problems. So, this study considers the integrated decision problem on FL and ACBF (FL-ACBF). 
Accordingly, the focus of this research is to (a) identify the best-known heuristics from literature for minimizing 
simultaneously fixed cost, salvage cost, and DKC for FL-ACBF; and (b) evaluate empirically the performance of identified 
heuristics for selecting efficient heuristic(s).

1. Introduction
The transport sector in India is largely controlled by the State Road Transport Undertakings (SRTUs) through their provision 
of inter-state, inter-city, and some intra-city services in selected cities. A few metropolitan cities have exclusive city 
transport corporations formed for city bus operations comprising the Urban Road Transportation System (URTS). Every 
Indian URTS (I-URTS) is a metropolitan/municipal-based SRTU.  
A recent amendment of the National Urban Transportation Policy (NUTP) in 2014 by the Indian government prioritizes 
public transport and allows its citizens “safe, affordable, quick, comfortable, reliable and sustainable access” (MoUD  2014). 
This also leads to a government mandate to put a price ceiling on bus fares for equitable transportation service. Despite high 
user dependence on city bus systems, going by the financial performances of each of the SRTUs in India (MoRTH, 2017), 
it is observed that almost every URTS in India is facing huge losses in operating buses. Due to this, the I-URTS find it 
challenging to raise their revenue sufficient enough to cover their cost of city bus operations (CCBOs) (Singh  2012). Hence, 
these systems require strategic interventions to minimize the CCBOs without changing the existing fare level. With this 
premise, this study aims to identify and address one such decision problem i.e., the Facility Location (FL) integrated with 
the allocation of city buses to facility (ACBF) problem (FL-ACBF).

7. Conclusions 
This study considers a new objective for the decision problem: FL – ACBF of I-URTS to minimize the CCBOs. As this 
problem can be viewed as a special type of transportation problem, the best-known heuristic methods reported in the 
literature for the traditional transportation problem are considered to apply to the FL – ACBF problem and to understand 
the status of these heuristic methods. For this research objective, a numerical example is considered. The analysis of the 
results indicated that the best performing heuristic methods reported in the recent studies, for the traditional transportation 
problem, are not necessarily performing as best when we applied these for the special case of the transportation problem 
such as FL – ACBF problem!! Further, the performance analysis indicated that both the variants of existing heuristic 
method: RAM outperformed all the other heuristics for the FL – ACBF problem. These inferences motivate us to address 
all the listed limitations of the present study as immediate future activity.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered the educational system and compelled schools to adopt an online 
teaching model. This study problem is designed to investigate the impact of virtual work immersion on University X-
partnered Senior High School (SHS) graduates from SHS A, SHS B, and SHS C in terms of employability and 
choosing a college career. To achieve this, the researchers used a descriptive-correlation research design. From the 
mean interval of 3.41 to 5.00, the Likert scale revealed positive responses from respondents on the virtual work 
immersion's effectiveness. Based on ANOVA results, there is a significant difference in their ratings regarding virtual 
work immersion’s reliability and comfort, as well as their employment status and track alignment. Moreover, their 
General Weighted Average (GWA) affected their ratings regarding their perceptions of the effectiveness, reliability, 
assistance, compliance, and comfort that virtual work immersion has, as well as their gained experiences, level of 
employability, and choosing a college program. Furthermore, the SHS graduates' virtual work immersion gained 
experience has a significant relationship with increasing their level of employability and level of selecting a college 
course. Enhancing students' engagement and participation, implementing face-to-face training, and improving 
calendar schedules are also recommended to help the institution strengthen the caliber of the work immersion program.

1. Introduction
Gozun and Rivera (2017) stated that youth unemployment accounts for more than half of the Philippines' unemployed 
population. They claimed that even if the rate of young people without jobs decreased from 16.8% in April 2013 to 
15.7% in April 2014, young people still made up more than half of the 2.9 million unemployed Filipinos. Businesses 
require skills that these young people still need to learn, despite millions of young people being out of school and 
ready for the workforce. One of the leading causes of young people's employment difficulties is the mismatch between 
jobs and the necessary skills (Wangmo 2012). As a result, it is essential to identify the variables and create policies 
that encourage young employment and entrepreneurship in the Philippines. 
Work immersion is one of the SHS subjects in the Philippines that needs to be completed to graduate. Students in their 
senior year of high school must participate in a work immersion program in an area directly relevant to their chosen 
tertiary program. It is an opportunity for students to develop professionally by simulating real-world employment 
(Bernales et al. 2020). Hence, it is an essential component of their curriculum since it tests, evaluates, and prepares 
them to perform the assigned task effectively and consistently.

Other recommendations: 
1. It is suggested that students have a learning environment in their homes far from distractions such as 
background noise, which significantly impact their learning session. They must have a separate study area to 
focus on doing their activities. 
2. The instructors can provide handouts and recorded videos of the session for students experiencing internet 
issues so that they can follow and understand the lesson further. 
3. The researchers recommended that the three-hour webinar should be divided into one hour and 25 minutes 
sessions (Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday, from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM), with 10 minutes break in between, to 
allow the students to have allotted time to rest, organize their notes, and absorb the information before 
proceeding to the next part of the session (See Figure 6). 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Improved Work Immersion Calendar (March 2022) 
 
4. It is also recommended to survey the partner community to understand the interests and needs of the students 
before implementing such a program and its activities, ensuring that it is aligned with their strands and chosen 
future careers. 
5. Given several reasons, such as time constraints and resources available, this study might have yet to reach 
the wholeness of the topic. Thus, partner communities should establish an alumni association and conduct 
work immersion post-survey to acquire more information. Moreover, future researchers may conduct a 
logical extension of the study (e.g., further research using work immersion appraisal). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study's findings reveal that community virtual work immersion effectively improves the SHS graduates' level of 
employability and the level of choosing a college course. It also shows that the activities and discussions relevant to 
students' strands helped them gain appropriate knowledge to understand their strand's scope further and adequately 
utilize their skills in their field. Based on the ANOVA findings, the differences between the virtual work immersion’s 
reliability and comfort, as well as the graduates’ employment status and track alignment, are significant. It denotes 
that their experience during their training affects their perceptions and level of employability. On the other hand, the 
General Weighted Average (GWA) is the only statistically significant factor on the SHS graduates' ratings based on 
their perceptions, gained experience, level of employability, and level of choosing a college course after taking virtual 
work immersion. It also means that virtual work immersion affects their academic performance. The Pearson 
correlation analysis results suggest that the relationship between SHS gained experience from virtual work immersion 
on their level of employability and choosing a college program is statistically significant. The strengths of these 
relationships are strongly positive, indicating that as their gained experience improved, their level of employability 
and level of choosing a college course also enhanced. 
 
However, virtual work immersion is challenging for some due to continuous discussion on the webinar that causes 
long duration, a distraction from their homes, and poor internet connection. But it helps develop most students and

gain awareness concerning their character strengths and weaknesses to showcase their skills fully. Also, it increases 
the student's work readiness, employment status, and track alignment under their level of employability by acquiring 
work ethics, soft skills, and technical skills that most companies look for in an employee. Similarly, developing these 
skills improves their decision-making in selecting their college course in terms of course content, capacity, and 
personality.  
 
Nonetheless, virtual work immersion is vital for Senior High School students. It hones the student to choose a career 
in college and increase their skills. The study’s findings present that virtual work immersion elevates the academic 
performance of grade 12 students and helps them prepare and develop their skills and perspective by gaining 
knowledge relevant to their chosen career. Thus, with effective implementation, this online program can help students 
grow as individuals and future professionals by giving them real-world learning opportunities in the workplace to 
complement their formal education and produce graduates who are prepared for success in the workforce.

Abstract 
Virtual reality allows a user to destroy the obstacle of distance and bring anything to you. Virtual museums are prime 
examples of that as they engulf users with experience allowing them to interact and explore different information 
provided by such facilities. Gaming with Connections aims to give the feel of the museum to the world of video games. 
The visitors of the Gaming with Connection Museum can have a virtual tour from the comfort of their own homes 
with the device everyone has beside them, a mobile phone. The research gap aims to find and develop an application 
using information and requirements needed in creating 3D models, PNG images, and videos. Using the related 
literature about several virtual museums, the researchers had a basis for their idea. For the design's completion, the 
researchers developed the medium from elements of their knowledge of what a museum is. This virtual museum is 
used not only for self-gain but also to make the information content accessible to the public, especially people in the 
community and video game lovers.

1. Introduction
Virtual reality allows a user to destroy the obstacle of distance and bring anything to you. Virtual museums are a prime 
example of that as they engulf users with an experience allowing them to interact and explore different information 
provided by such facilities. Gaming with Connections aims to give the feel of the museum to the world of video games. 
The Gaming with Connection Museum visitors can have a virtual tour from the comfort of their own homes with the 
device everyone has beside them, a mobile phone. The research gap aims to find and develop an application using 
information and requirements needed in creating 3D models, PNG images, and animation. This virtual museum is not 
only for self-gain but to make the information content accessible to the public, especially people in the community 
and video game lovers. 
1.1 Objectives 
The main objective of this study is to create a functional video game that can be played on a mobile device. The video 
game was a virtual museum that provided players with access to video game collector items that have been unavailable 
in their country. The researcher provided a game that gives an alternative to users to consume material entertainingly 
and educationally without the worry of expenses and boredom. Going into detail are the specific objectives and 
requirements to accomplish the goal: Design, Develop, Test, and Publish.  
In addition to the objective are the core functionalities and accessibility features implemented in the product:

3. Animation Accessibility 
The spinning of the items allowed for the users to be able to see the details of the displayed options easily. Making 
the needed to navigate through VR controls less intimidating for new players of the concept. 
5.3 Discussion 
User Satisfaction 
The overall feedback was positive with most of the users being in their early to mid-twenties. Some of the older 
users have shown a bit of confusion when playing the game initially and needed guidance on how to play a virtual 
reality game. However, that did not tarnish their attitude on the gameplay experience.  
Suggestions for Enhancements 
Others ask for more culture to be implemented within the environment of the museum to make it more exciting to 
look at. And for the mini games built into the games to be more challenging so that the replay value of it can 
increase for them. 
6. Conclusion 
Researchers developed a virtual museum from the ground up. Building models in Blender and making the video 
come to life with Unity Engine. Core elements that were tackled were virtual exhibition, Virtual Immersion, and 
Quiz Trivia. The researchers sought to provide the merging of education and video games by putting the two 
together in a virtual world. As a target demographic that is in a developing country this development closed the gap 
between Filipinos and collection and eliminated the risk of scalper dangers. Since the video game was focused on 
one genre it is possible to have the other genres added into the game. The comments of players asking for more 
culture to the setting of the world is also a possible addition to the game. The game can also expand to have full VR 
capabilities if motion control attachments were to be installed. The researchers succeeded in making a virtual 
museum and knocked out all objectives stated. The core elements have been established therefore making room for 
improvements clear and concise.

Abstract 
The Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) sector plays a crucial role in the socio-economic development of 
any country, especially in today's globalized environment. SMEs act as potential sources of employment generation 
and economic growth. However, these enterprises often face threats from larger organizations, since they may directly 
or indirectly act as ancillary units to these larger players. In order to remain competitive in both domestic and global 
markets, SMEs need to recognize the value of their products and services from the customers' perspective. 
Additionally, they must eliminate non-value activities in their production processes and focus on improving 
profitability through various manufacturing strategies Among the numerous of manufacturing strategies available, the 
Lean Production System (LPS) has consistently been identified as the most effective method or strategy for enhancing 
operational efficiency. Although there have been numerous success stories of LPS implementation across various 
industries, many SMEs still struggle to embrace LPS in their operations in order to gain a competitive edge. 
Furthermore, there is a lack of suitable structural models or frameworks for implementing LPS specifically in SMEs. 
This study aims to develop a generalized contextual relationship structural model for implementing LPS in Indian 
SMEs. To address this issue, a three-phase research methodology is employed. In the first phase, all enablers/factors 
are identified through a comprehensive literature review and Pareto analysis (PA). Based on these identified factors, 
a contextual relationship structural model is constructed using the Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) 
approach in the second phase. Finally, the output of TISM is used to classify the factors based on their impact on other 
factors using the MICMAC methodology. This leads to the development of a House of Lean model (HOL). The 
proposed contextual relationship structural model, along with HOL, is expected to enhance the understanding of 
implementing LPS in SMEs for both academicians and practitioners.

1. Introduction
The Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) sector has emerged as an immensely high-spirited and energetic 
sector of the Indian economy over the last five decades. It has played a significant role in the country's socio-economic 
development by creating large SMEs considered pillars of the Indian economy. These SMEs act as potential sources 
of employment generation and economic growth. The progress of globalization has provided extensive opportunities 
not only to large organizations but also to SMEs globally. Due to globalization, companies can now communicate 
more efficiently across boundaries, reaching a more extensive customer base and transporting goods and services 
faster and easier. While exploring the benefits of globalization, large-sized organizations often pose a significant threat 
to MSMEs (Masroora and Asim  2019) since many SMEs directly or indirectly function as ancillary units to these 
large organizations. To remain competitive in domestic and global markets, SMEs must recognize the value of their 
products and services from the customer's perspective. They should also eliminate non-value activities by employing 
various manufacturing strategies in the production process to improve their organization's profit (Alkhoraif et al. 
2019). Among the different manufacturing strategies discussed in the literature, Lean Manufacturing (LM) or LPS 
(Lean Production System) is becoming increasingly important regardless of industry size. The main objective of LPS 
is to produce a higher-quality product at the lowest possible cost and in the shortest time by eliminating waste. There 
are seven types of waste associated with LPS, including overproduction, inventory, waiting time, overprocessing,

Finally, based on the contextual relationship structural model and HoL developed in this research, SME managers can 
enhance their understanding of the lean vital factors and gain clarity on their relationships. This knowledge enables 
them to devise effective strategies for implementing the LPS in their manufacturing environment. Finally using the 
implemented LPS, SMEs are expected to eliminate all non-value-added activities in their production processes for 
improving system performance and increase overall efficiency.

Abstract 
This paper presents unsupervised holding rule generation for a climbing robot Bernoulli holding pad, based on 
Evolutionary Algorithms. Dynamic variations in frictional coefficient of surface and robot state require adaptability 
on holding force, when combined with internal pad dynamics. A hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (hEA) combining 
operators from Differential Evolution, Memetic Algorithm and Multi Objective aNd open-Ended Evolution (MONEE) 
Implementation was developed, tested and validated for augmenting robot pad dynamics in a dynamic environment, 
with the aim of reduction in pressure energy usage. Different variable combinations established in literature were 
permuted and results observed in terms of solution standard and speed. Comparative results showed the hEA method 
produced better results than other algorithms in terms of solution quality and processing time. Hence the work 
exhibited that hEA can improve holding force adaptability by providing quickly a set of near optimum conditions for 
the climbing robot.

the hEA. Using the proposed hybrid technique improves the convergence rate by calculating the best value 1.72 with 
the best fitness value of 0.8 closest to 1 and standard deviation 0.005. Compared to best results given in literature, 
hEA gives better results for pneumatics force problem, as can be seen in Table 3. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
5. Conclusion  
This paper has presented a hybrid Evolutionary search algorithm combining Differential Evolution, Memetic 
Algorithm and MONEE Implementation. In MATLAB simulations, this algorithm has shown to develop optimum 
holding force significantly faster than the stand alone algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed 
hEA can improve fitness by providing quickly a set of near optimum conditions. The hEA based optimisation approach 
introduced combines established computing methods in a hybrid framework for combined internal adaptation and 
environment task driven optimisation of a climbing robot Bernoulli based holding pad. The framework consists of: 1. 
Objective function modelling based on the Derivative rule, 2. Fitness function value for parameter inclusion, 3. An 
evolutionary based hybrid optimisation algorithm and 4. MATLAB modelling and simulation. The framework has 
been implemented and tested in MATLAB. The results of the application presented show that the approach can find 
an optimal holding force and that the system parameters can be determined. The tests realized in this paper will now 
allow holding force design problems of the same class to be solved by using the best combination of operators found 
in this article. It is now also possible to move on to the next stage of the project and represent these findings in a 
suitable control scheme.

Abstract 
The high volume of daily e-commerce shipments in major urban areas require today’s technology of drones for last-
mile delivery (LMD) of parcels. The traditional method of delivering parcels using trucks is time-consuming due to 
traffic congestion, impeding their timely delivery. On the other hand, drones can avoid traffic congestion by flying 
over road networks. However, drones have a limited flight endurance due to their battery capacity constraints. At the 
same time, trucks possess long-haul capabilities. Hence, for achieving an efficient LMD, both trucks and drones should 
be integrated to offset each other’s disadvantages. This paper addresses one such truck-drone based last-mile delivery 
(TD-LMD) problem. There are plenty of studies which have investigated TD-LMD problem with different 
configurations. For our study, we examine the TD-LMD problems involving single depot, single truck and multiple 
drones (SD-ST-MD) configuration. In the literature, various researchers have used mathematical models and heuristics 
to address this problem. In our study, we consider one Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model given in the 
existing literature for the TD-LMD problem with SD-ST-MD configuration and relax one of their assumptions to give 
it a new dimension. In the process of extending the MILP model, we also introduce the CO2 emission cost along with 
the economic cost for optimizing the TD-LMD problem. Accordingly, the workability of the MILP model is tested 
using a tiny numerical example and solved through developing a code in the Python-MILP solver module. Further, 
the computational complexity is analyzed by increasing the number of nodes in the SD-ST-MD based TD-LMD 
problem.

1. Introduction
In a last-mile delivery (LMD) system, the determination of an effective delivery path plays a pivotal role (Chang and 
Lee 2018). The usage of drones in an LMD can increase the overall efficiency of the system. This is because, drones 
can lead to a significant reduction in labour costs. Additionally, drones are faster than traditional vehicles like trucks, 
hence are used for delivering parcels. Moreso, they can fly over road networks to avoid traffic problems without any 
human intervention (Tinic et al. 2023). Despite these advantages, the utilization of drones in an LMD comes with a 
few drawbacks. Due to the physical characteristics of drones, they are subject to certain limitations. Firstly, their flight 
endurance is constrained by their battery capacity since they solely rely on battery power. Additionally, most delivery 
drones have a limited payload capacity, in terms of weight and size, often allowing for the transportation of only a 
single parcel at a time. In contrast, traditional vehicles like trucks possess the ability to transport multiple parcels 
simultaneously without being concerned about the individual parcel weight and size. Additionally, trucks possess long 
range travel capabilities, enabling them to visit multiple customers before returning to the depot for efficient deliveries. 
This brings the need to integrate both the trucks and drones for faster deliveries (Wohlsen  2014).

6. Computational Complexity of the Proposed 0-1 MILP Model 
The computational complexity of the proposed 0-1 MILP model is analyzed by increasing the number of nodes in the 
parcel-delivery network. Table 3 illustrates the CPU time (in seconds) taken on Mac OS system running at 3.5 GHz 
using 8 GB of RAM for obtaining the optimal solutions. For the last row having 14 customer locations in the parcel-
delivery problem, the time exceeded 20 hours to get optimal solution after which we had to stop running the program. 
This shows the computational intractability of the 0-1 MILP model and further highlights the need to develop heuristic 
methods for tackling the TD-LMD problem involving more than 13 nodes.

7. Conclusions 
In this study, we considered a single depot, a single truck and multiple drones (SD-ST-MD) configuration for a truck-
drone based last-mile delivery (TD-LMD) problem. Due to the increasing environmental concerns, we considered 
minimizing the cost from an economic and environmental perspective as compared to the total completion time of 
delivery of TD-LMD. With this, the existing Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model in the literature is 
appropriately extended for the additional dimension considered in the problem configuration of TD-LMD problem. 
Then, the proposed MILP model was demonstrated by developing a suitable numerical example to reflect the problem 
configuration considered in this study. Further, the computational complexity of the proposed MILP model was 
analysed by increasing the number of delivery points. The computational complexity analysis clearly indicated that 
the simpler version of TD-LMD is computationally intractable to get an optimal solution. So, the TD-LMD problem 
requires an alternate method such as heuristic algorithm and this becomes the immediate future research issue for 
addressing TD-LMD problem considered in this study.

Abstract 
Bangladesh’s economy draws its main strength from the agriculture sector. Rice is the staple food of the country, and 
is the most important crop in Bangladesh’s agricultural sector. However, this sector is facing numerous challenges. 
The main challenge is proper tracking of agricultural products and ensuring payment after delivery. As the whole 
transaction process of products and money currently depends on third parties, both buyers and sellers use agents for 
delivery and payment of food. Ultimately these agents add additional cost to the system. Blockchain is a technology 
that can provide a remarkable solution for product traceability in agriculture and food supply chains. In this paper, we 
have conceptualized a Smart contract-based agricultural system through which buyers and sellers can directly interact 
with each other. With leveraging the smart contract facility of blockchain, transactions among stakeholders can be 
recorded, and the need for intermediaries will be eliminated prevailing a central authority system. All transactions will 
be recorded in Blockchain’s immutable ledger which provides a high level of transparency and traceability to the 
supply chain. Furthermore, in this paper, we have provided data privacy protection solutions through cryptographic 
primitives and Markle trees that can avoid enterprise privacy and sensitive data leakage. We have also shown cost 
analysis and performance analysis. We made our smart contract codes publicly available on GitHub.

1. Introduction
Being an agricultural country, Bangladesh faces numerous problems related to the most complex risk issues in the 
paddy-rice market. The rice market of Bangladesh plays a significant role in the overall economic performance of the 
country by means of its contribution to GDP, employment generation, and food security. Any damage that happens in 
this sector has a huge impact on the well-being of most of the people of this country (M. C. Rahman et al. 2018). 
Agricultural supply chains of the rice industry are complicated system network that involves various stakeholders such 
as farmers, millers, retailers, traders, wholesalers, and customers. In the Agricultural food supply chain domain, to 
maintain the transparency and trust between the total supply chain network and existing participants, it is a must that 
the collected records have to be tamperproof, which will resolve the case of ensuring transparency in the transaction 
of payment in between the participants without relying on any kind of integrated third-party intermediary (Q. Y. A. 
Zhang 2022). In Bangladesh, there is seen price domination by intermediaries in the supply chain of rice and there is 
a lack of information flow between entities a major setback as well (D. Roy et al. 2019). Lack of transparency in 
transactions, false storage claim, and losses of input like the seed, and fertilizers are also seen. These irregularities 
happen as there is a lack of transparency in this rice supply chain (Ahmed, Akhter et al.  2021) And therefore, the 
potential explication for such a situation and concern is the use of Ethereum Blockchain, which does not depend on 
any centralized authorities and servers. As each and every record is stored in Ethereum Blockchain which is based on 
the nature of this technology network, this distributed chain of database ledger is immutable by means of its own

unnecessary Blockchain interactions within loops. When used in public platforms the cost can be further minimized 
by the moderation of codes. 
4. Conclusion 
In previous years, the agricultural supply chain traceability network for rice was overlooked. Nowadays it has raised 
a public concern. To keep a record of specific information and database about the purchased product (rice) and its 
raw material status throughout the entire rice supply chain of Bangladesh. To conclude, we have tried to create a 
trusted Smart contract-based Blockchain traceability system to ensure transparent information flow between the 
stakeholders of the rice supply chain. Smart contracts were created to ensure proper product tracking and reduce the 
uncertainty regarding payment issues. This paper addressed issues of data storage, data integrity, low traceability of 
products, and lack of transparency in the transaction of funds and products of the rice supply chain of Bangladesh. 
We have focused on the issue of the lack of information technology use in the rice supply chain of Bangladesh and 
tried to overcome this problem with a Smart contract-based solution. cost, security and performance analysis was 
done based on testing and validating the Smart contracts. Any attempt to make the functions of the smart contract 
more optimized is likely to be made. This will reduce the Gas consumption of smart contracts. When Ethereum 2.0 
is published, this can be made to reinforce the contracts. How product conditions can be verified with the help of 
decentralized consensus needs further analysis. Further analysis can be done on how to reverse a transaction through 
a smart contract when arrived product is damaged.

Abstract 
Nowadays, it is crucial for any business to implement a unique strategy to compete and survive in the market. The 
purpose of this thesis is to investigate the interactions between business environment, generic strategy, operations 
strategy, and business performance in the Lebanese economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, this study will 
examine the mediation effects of both generic and operations strategies between the business environment and 
business performance. Hence, drawing upon the theory of contingency, theory of strategic management, and resource-
based view theory, a conceptual model was developed and empirically tested. The study was conducted by analyzing 
data collected via an online questionnaire from employees working in different Lebanese companies. Several 
statistical techniques were employed to conduct the data analysis phase of the study using the statistical software SPSS 
package. The statistical techniques included reliability and validity analysis, factor analysis, correlation and regression 
analysis, hypothesis testing, and mediation analysis. From our findings, the results confirmed the significance of the 
direct effects at the aggregate level. In addition, analysis at the sub-dimensions level revealed mixed results regarding 
the significance of the proposed relationships. Moreover, partial mediation effect was detected as the generic strategy 
was found to partially mediate the relationships between business environment and operations strategy. Similarly, 
generic strategy partially mediated the relationship between business environment and business performance.

1.1 Introduction 
External factors greatly influence firms' business performance, including business environment uncertainty, 
competition intensity, and global market changes (Zand and Rezaei 2020). The COVID-19 outbreak has escalated 
uncertainty levels, underscoring the importance of strategic choice for competitive advantage and survival. Also, 
enhancing manufacturing requires tailored operations strategy for competitive edge (Nassereddine and Wehbe 2018). 
In Addition, Acquah and Amoako-Gyampah (2008) stress the alignment of operations strategy with generic strategy 
for goal attainment. Therefore, exploring relationships among business environment, generic strategy, operations 
strategy, and business performance is vital. However, limited research examines these four variables. This study delves 
into Business environment, generic strategy, operations strategy, and business performance, integrating the 
contingency theory, strategic management theory, and resource-based view theory to analyze these elements.

operations strategy-business performance ties. However, Ward and Duray (2000) reported mediation. The limited 
sample size could contribute to the absence of mediation despite potential trends. 
 
6 Conclusion 
The research had two main objectives. Firstly, it aimed to observe interactions between business environment, generic 
strategy, operations strategy, and business performance during COVID-19 in the Lebanese economy. Results indicated 
significant direct effects of each variable, with changing interactions based on other variables. Secondly, the study 
tested whether generic and operations strategies could mediate and significantly affect ENV and PER during COVID-
19. Partial mediation was seen between various strategies and performance. This suggests that cost leadership, 
differentiation, or focus strategies could be more effective under changing business environments. Results align with 
contingency theory, strategic management theory, and resource-based view theory. The study has limitations, 
including no funding and a small data sample (51 participants). Future research should explore these interactions 
further and consider additional variables like supply chain integration and innovation strategies.

Abstract 
The manufacturing of semiconductor chips consists of a four-stage process: wafer fabrication or processing, sort or 
probe, assembly, and test. Out of four stages, wafer fabrication, which necessitates a large amount of investment in 
plant and equipment, is probably the most complicated manufacturing process today. In addition, wafer fabrication 
complexity is caused by many factors, including unrelated parallel machines, batch machines, uncertain process yields, 
re-entrant process flows, random equipment failures, and process variability. Maintaining a competitive advantage 
and remaining profitable in operational terms requires improvements in wafer fab performance. Workload Control 
(WC), a combination of Order Release Control (ORC) and Dispatching Control (DC), is employed to regulate the 
flow of orders through the wafer fab, and this is a promising technique to reduce the wafer’s processing cost and 
increase customer satisfaction by delivering products on time. Particularly, ORC is considered a critical operational 
control strategy in wafer fab as it controls the system's WIP and meets due dates. Hence, to properly understand ORC 
policies, this study meticulously reviews the existing studies on ORC in wafer fabrication. Based on the literature 
analysis, the existing ORC policies are classified considering eight dimensions that describe fundamental 
characteristics and logic behind the ORC policies and possible suggestions are presented for future work. Further, this 
study presents a discrete event simulation (DES) based conceptual model framework for the performance assessment 
of any ORC policies with various performance measures such as average cycle time, average throughput, WIP level 
and number of tardy jobs. The proposed DES model can capture the complexities in the wafer fabs, such as re-entrance, 
non-identical parallel machines, and rework, in a very effective manner. Finally, the proposed framework is expected 
to improve the efficiency of the DES model as it reduces the preparation time for input data and is also flexible to 
emulate random scenarios with uncertain processing times, product mix and product routes.

Abstract 
In recent years, job recommender systems (JRSs) have been developed to compute matching scores of workers for 
projects. However, their RSs do not satisfy monotonicity. Satisfying monotonicity is important because it is a matter 
of course for users. In this study, we propose a monotonic JRS. The conventional monotonic model guarantees 
monotonicity for one type of input value. However, there is no study on a monotonic model that guarantees 
monotonicity for two types of input data: workers and projects. Our model can guarantee monotonicity for changes in 
two types of input data. Our study is novel with respect to the JRS and monotonic model.

1. Introduction
The information technology (IT) industry involves various projects such as system development and infrastructure 
construction. Recommending an appropriate worker to a project is important for the project’s success. However, it is 
difficult to determine the matching score (measure of whether a worker matches a project) of the worker and project. 
There is a significant amount of information about workers (various skills, personality, and desired working 
environment) and information about projects (required skills and work environment), which makes this judgment 
complicated.  
In recent years, there have been increasing cases of developing recommender systems (RSs) that compute the matching 
scores of the worker and project. However, these RSs have a problem in that they do not satisfy monotonicity of the 
worker and project. Monotonicity of the worker and project implies that if the skills of the worker improve, the 
matching score increases, and if the required skills of the project improve, the matching score decreases. This is 
because, if the skills of the worker improve, the project gets easier. Moreover, if the required skills of the project 
improve, the project becomes harder. Therefore, it is natural for people that RSs satisfy monotonicity. Creating an RS 
that satisfies monotonicity is necessary for RS users.  
In this study, we propose an RS that satisfies monotonicity. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In 
Section 2, we present some works related to our study. In Section 3, we highlight the structure of our model. In Section 
4, we present the data, as well as the content and results of the experiment. Section 5 summarizes the paper and 
presents the future prospects of our study. 
2. Literature Review
An RS is used for recommending items (movies, books, etc.) to users. Recent studies on RS have mainstreamed the 
use of deep learning. Using deep learning, it is known that the accuracy is higher than that of the conventional model 
without deep learning (Shuai et al. 2019). The deep learning model first inputs the user and item information vectorized 
in the preprocessing. Thereafter, it extracts user and item features separately. Finally, the model uses the user and item 
features to generate the matching score. The reason for extracting the features separately is that the model can add 
various ingenious devices. For example, one can use cross-domain to filter out features specific to a particular domain 
(Heishiro et al. 2019), (Shuqing et al. 2019) , use an autoencoder to learn features from a small amount of data and 
remove data noise (Sheng et al. 2015), look for user or item with similar features, know which elements of the worker

where TP (true positive) denotes the number that the model predicted as 1 for data with label 1, FN (false negative) 
denotes the number that the model predicted as 1 for data with label 0, TN (true negative) denotes the number that the 
model predicted as 0 for data with label 0, and FP (false positive) denotes the number that the model predicted as 1 for 
data with label 0.  Inside the parentheses to the right of the BA equation, the first expression implies the accuracy of the 
positive example, whereas the second expression implies the accuracy of the negative example. Thus, BA is the average 
accuracy of the positive and negative examples. 
To understand the accuracy of the proposed model’s recommendation, we compare the accuracy when predicting all 1s 
and the accuracy of the cut-off model. Here, the cut-off model comprises feature extraction without weight constraints 
and an evaluation function that outputs the Euclidean distance between two features as a sigmoid function. We compare 
the precision with a t-test with a 5% significance level. In general, we also need to compare the accuracy of the model 
to the accuracy of predicting all 0s. The accuracy of BA is 50% when the model predicts all 0s. The accuracy of BA 
when the model predicts all 1s is also 50%; thus, we ignore that the model predicts all 0s. To verify whether there is a 
significant difference in accuracy, the training data were divided into 10 parts, and with the data excluding one part, the 
training was performed 10 times while changing the division. 
 
4.2 Experimental Results 
The experimental results are summarized in TABLE V. The BA column in TABLE V lists the mean and standard 
deviation (in parentheses) of the BA for 10 assessments. Column P-value lists the P-values obtained from the t-test with 
a 5% significance level with the proposed model. 
The P-value of proposed model and cut-off model is 1.38*10−4, which is less than 0.05. Moreover, the average value 
of the BA is higher in the cut off model. Therefore, it is observed that the cut-off model is more accurate.  
The P-value of the proposed model that can predict all 1s is 5.29*10−9, which is less than 0.05. Moreover, the average 
value of the BA is higher in the proposed model. Therefore, it is observed that the proposed model is more accurate.  
From these results, it is observed that the proposed model is less accurate than the cut-off model, but it can guarantee 
the minimum accuracy. In contrast, the accuracy is higher than when all 1s or 0s are predicted; thus, it is observed that 
it has the minimum accuracy.

5. Conclusions 
In this study, we proposed a JRS model that guarantees monotonicity. Our model makes predictions satisfying 
monotonicity for changes in two inputs, the worker and project. In the conventional monotonic model, it was not 
possible to maintain monotonicity against changes in two input values. By constraining the weights to be positive, we 
designed a feature extraction such that the higher the skill, the greater the feature. The matching score function was 
designed to determine the suitability by comparing the value of the two features. We mathematically proved that the 
proposed model satisfies monotonicity.  
As a result of the analysis, we confirmed that the prediction accuracy of the model is higher than the prediction of all 
1s. Thus, the minimum degree of the accuracy is assumed to be guaranteed. In contrast, we confirmed that the proposed 
model is less accurate than the cut-off model. A future work will involve eliminating the difference in prediction 
accuracy between with and without monotonicity. 
Specifically, we envision that proposed model intends to increase the expressive power of feature extraction. Feature 
extraction of the model used in the experiment comprises a linear layer and an active function. We observe that the 
configuration is extremely simple. Previous studies on monotonic models involved complex models, such as the deep 
lattice network (DLN) (Seungil et al. 2017). These models are more expressive; thus, their accuracy is also higher. 
Replacing the construction of feature extraction from this construction to the DLN (or other complex monotonic model) 
will improve accuracy.

Abstract 
Low-volume/high-complexity industries are known for their unique designs and custom products, which require 
extremely flexible manufacturing processes. Implementing Lean principles is the best way to enhance flexibility 
and achieve success by offering the ""best price in the market"" and ""fast delivery."" However, the application of 
Lean principles depends on the type of production layout and business. Continuous production processes and 
variable production processes have distinct demands and targets. Applying the same Lean terminology to both 
industries can result in losses in terms of inventory, safety stock, pull systems, and takt times. This paper aims to 
address the common problems faced by low-volume/high-complexity industries and demonstrate how Lean 
techniques and thinking can resolve them. This paper aims to explain the cost benefits resulting from process 
improvement in the Volume-1 case study. It further explores process improvements in different complex areas, 
providing a clearer explanation of how lean thinking transforms complex processes into flexible ones. The focus 
on improving the paint and shipping processes stems directly from customer feedback regarding quality non-
conformances and new customer development. Additionally, special process audits by new customers have 
influenced this focus. To illustrate the practical benefits of Lean thinking in industrial development and highlight 
the differences between low-volume/high-complexity industries, we will examine the industrial painting process. 
Industrial painting involves a range of complex tasks, including storing, mixing, spraying, testing, data 
availability, tools arrangement, inventory management, climate control, paint estimation, spray procedures, 
measuring devices, lighting quality, and layout optimization for smooth product flow. Jones Metal Inc. serves as 
an excellent example of a high-volume/complex industry. Improving process quality and maintaining acceptable 
performance levels are crucial for the success of any organization. Lean thinking provides an opportunity to 
enhance process flexibility for successful organizations. This paper first explains the current processes of the 
complex industry and then demonstrates how lean thinking contributes to the development of these processes. 
Keywords 
Flexible manufacturing processes, Continuous production processes, Process improvement, Lean principles, 
Industrial painting. 
1. Introduction
Low volume/high complexity industries face challenges with procedures due to the customization and varying 
manufacturing processes involved. These processes encompass cutting, molding, shaping, pressing, punching, 
bending, welding, painting, and more. Hence, implementing Lean manufacturing tools like kaizen and control 
boards becomes essential in such industries. To illustrate this concept, we can examine Jones Metal Inc., located 
in Mankato, Minnesota, as an example. Jones Metal Inc. excels in sheet metal processing and specializes in 
complex processes with low volume production. Their expertise lies in crafting unique custom-built sheet metal 
products for companies worldwide. However, consistently manufacturing products with different procedures, 
quality standards, and testing requirements poses a significant challenge. Therefore, continuous process 
improvement based on demand is crucial. The focus is on the paint process in Jones Metal Inc. with the objective 
of improving the process using lean methodologies. Furthermore, the process costs and savings due to lean process 
improvements are discussed as well as the reduced quality defects due to the combination of a six-sigma project 
with the lean processes. Using Six Sigma tools and ANOVA analysis, we can identify the root causes of paint 
quality issues. This process aligns well with the principles of Lean methodology.

4.2 Paint quality: 
All the process improvements discussed in the case study were found to increase paint quality, both directly and 
indirectly. Improved quality led to profits and business improvements in the future. 
 
4.3 Saves money: 
Lesser money was spent on process improvement, and in most cases, no money was spent at all. This directly 
saved money in the form of less maintenance. Cost estimator and coverage charts saved direct money by 
purchasing the right amount and billing the customer the right amount. This also saved money on labor charges 
by making the processes faster by eliminating non-value-added time and sitting time. 
 
4.4 More scope for business development: 
After these improvements were made at Jones Metal Inc., the company won a project and qualified as a supplier 
for a well-respected company. This was due to the company's best procedures, failure processes, and ongoing 
improvement. Therefore, there is a lot of potential for future business development. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Lean thinking has increased flexibility, process speed, and cost savings (Womack et. al, 1990). The major 
difference between continuous production processes and custom product processes is the rate of improvement due 
to complexity. The rate of change is much slower for custom production due to unique designs and complex 
processes, but it still decreases complexity. The same changes in high-volume/continuous production plants give 
much better results. While applying lean methodologies, only a few have been applied because some do not work, 
such as pull. It is difficult to apply pull in more customized settings due to different paints, customers, and 
procedures. Lean thinking always makes changes towards flexibility regardless of the size of the industry, but 
there will be a difference in applying lean to complex and non-complex industries, and the development rate will 
also be different.

Abstract 
Low-volume/high-complexity industries are known for their unique designs and custom products, which require 
extremely flexible manufacturing processes. Flexible processes can improve quality, reduce process complexity, 
reduce changeover time and lead times, leading to success in the market. Lean principles are the best way to 
improve flexibility in these industries. However, the implementation of Lean principles depends on the type of 
production layout, processes, and business design. For example, a production process with a fixed demand target 
will require different Lean principles than a variable production process with a changing demand target. Part 2 of 
this paper explains the cost benefits of process improvement from Part 1 of the research. It then continues with 
process improvements in different complex areas to provide a clearer explanation of how lean thinking can make 
flexible processes from complex processes. The focus on process improvement in the paint and shipping processes 
was a direct result of customer feedback with respect to quality non-conformances, new customer development, 
and special process audits by new customers.

1. Introduction
Lean Thinking is a key to improving processes. It is not a new concept, as it derives from the Toyota Production 
System (TPS) and Just in Time production (Henry Ford), among other predecessors. Most manufacturing 
companies have adopted lean and are running successfully, while fewer small to mid-size companies have been 
improving using lean methodologies. However, this is changing, as big industries are now stepping towards world-
class advanced lean technology and are driving out waste along their lean journeys. 
In Part 1, the paint process at Jones Metal Inc. was improved using lean methodologies, specifically applied to the 
painting portion of the process. In Part 2, the process costs, and savings due to lean process improvements from 
Part 1 will be discussed, as well as the reduction in quality defects due to a Six Sigma project. Six Sigma tools 
and ANOVA analysis are being applied to identify the root cause of paint quality problems and to work towards 
solving those problems, which also fits nicely into lean methodology. Many African and Asian industries do not 
utilize lean due to the perception that it is costly and can result in job termination. Some experts argue that their 
complex processes are unsuitable for lean manufacturing, but any industry can benefit from some form of lean. 
This paper focuses on improving a complex process for wash-paint and shipping, highlighting the effectiveness 
of applying lean principles (Murthy and Kobbacy 2018). 
2. Literature Review
In Part 1, many processes were improved in the paint shop to save money on material costs. When dealing with a 
highly complex procedure, streamlining effectively and reducing costs becomes challenging. However, a deep 
analysis was conducted on over spraying paint, mixing paints, and coverage estimation. Firstly, the current prices 
needed estimation before updating the procedure and determining the cumulative paint costs. Subsequently, 
efforts were made to work towards the updated procedure. If all aspects of the paint estimating process are 
familiar, updating the formulas for obtaining the actual cost becomes easier. To confirm proximity to the new 
cost, testing was required by tracking the parts or monitoring paint purchase expenses. Consequently, an 
estimation of the current costs is required.

5. Conclusion:
Flexibility was increased, process speed was proven, and cost savings were provided by lean thinking. The use of 
both lean and six sigma in various projects played an instrumental role in creating a process and work environment 
that facilitated excellent outcomes on customer audits. Quality improvement within the paint process was achieved 
through the use of 5S methods and six sigma DOE projects. Procedural changes resulting from lean projects led 
to the documentation of procedures within the ISO framework and contributed to Jones Metal Inc.'s registration 
to ISO 9001-2015 standard. The combination of lean projects in paint and engineering estimating was crucial in 
acquiring a new customer, Alstom, a company that builds high-speed trains. Passing Alstom's company audits, 
especially their special process audit in the paint area, can be observed in the audit results.

Abstract     
Engineered systems are prevalent to failures when they are in operation. Therefore, maintaining their reliability 
is critical to ensure they continue operating safely and reliably for their entire lifespan. However, continuously 
planning and scheduling their reliability maintenance functions is necessary to improve their operation, 
availability, and overall reliability. Through a case study, the research study evaluates maintenance strategic 
approaches on a critical asset in a brick manufacturing process to improve the reliability of the asset for quality 
production. Based on historic failure analysis, optimized maintenance plans and schedules are derived and 
implemented on the asset to reduce or eliminate unplanned work.

Introduction 
System or asset reliability is very important in ensuring the expected performance and production or service 
quality. Engineered systems are bound to fail if they are not maintained accordingly during their operation.  It is 
often heard from other departments within the operation that system or asset maintenance work is solely meant 
for engineering personnel, and this has put so much pressure on limited human resources that engineering 
departments mostly operate with. In other instances, planning and scheduling of reliability maintenance functions 
are left to junior or low-skilled personnel in the organization or even outsourced to another business outside the 
organization as its often considered administrative than strategic. Maintenance planning and scheduling include 
the choice of maintenance strategies, whether time-based, condition-based, or a combination thereof.  
Maintenance of engineered systems for reliability is about continuous planning, scheduling, organizing, and 
controlling of all the maintenance work so that repairs, replacement, or modification of technical systems are 
accomplished, and that they perform their intended functions for a specified period (Visser 1997; Duffuaa and 
Raouf 2015).  The main objective of this function is to maximize the safety, availability, and reliability of a 
physical asset, and to achieve that, planning and scheduling maintenance work has to be performed to ensure 
overall system reliability. Nel (2006) thinks that maintenance planning is key to a maintenance management 
framework and further suggests that maintenance planning functions must be both strategic and tactical. 
Strategically, maintenance planning must focus on the vision, mission, and key objectives of the maintenance 
system or department, whilst tactical is more concerned with short-term objectives and leads to the development 
of a maintenance plan for each item of the tactical system and detailed planning for each maintenance task (Nel 
2006). 
Sometimes, the function of identifying a critical asset for maintenance purposes through risk analysis in an 
operation is often overlooked. Although this function does not only assist with the maintenance of the asset, it can 
also assist with the identification of risk areas such as poor or deficient quality production or service that the 
business needs to put critical measures on, to avoid any mishap. In engineering maintenance, planning, and 
scheduling must include the alignment of maintenance tasks with respective maintenance strategies, and such

Conclusion 
An effective maintenance planning and scheduling program is a dynamic process that requires constant 
optimization. It is very important that such a program continuously evaluate system failures against available 
resources for the improvement of asset reliability. Such a program must be better at preventing failure recurrence 
whilst extending the lifespan of the system or asset. 
A combination of time-based, and condition-based approaches to maintenance planning and scheduling could be 
successful in preventing failure recurrence and optimizing the maintenance program. An extended evaluation of 
data provided through condition-based could assist in optimizing maintenance tasks and scheduling thereof tasks.       
Unnecessary maintenance tasks often result in inefficient utilization of resources, and this leads to increased 
maintenance costs.

Abstract 
Bruises can appear when blood vessels rupture, which can lead to the risk of blood leakage into the surrounding 
tissues. Evaluation and detection of these symptoms, especially those related to health problems or accidents, are very 
important in medical environments. Bruises can also serve as an alert sign of health problems that a medical evaluation 
is recommended and might be urgently needed. Unfortunately, it can be very challenging for medical practitioners to 
appropriately identify and categorize bruises due to the complexity of the situations and many types of bruises. The 
main goal of this study is to promote the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare systems. It aims to help 
improve computer-aided practices by making use of an open-source algorithm such as YOLOv8 and incorporate it 
into a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach for fast and precise identification of bruises. In this study, we introduce 
an approach to this problem by using the CBR-YOLO approach. The use of the CBR-YOLO approach can help and 
support the decision-making practice. Although bruises have many types and the same appearance, it can still provide 
recommendations and commentary on the bruises. This method can be useful in diagnosing patients in a timely 
manner.

1. Introduction
Bruises, the condition is also known as ecchymosis (Hartley et al. 2023), occurs when the blood vessels get ruptured. 
As a result, blood can leak into surrounding tissues. In medical contexts, the identification and evaluation of symptoms 
is of the highest significance since symptoms can serve as possible markers of underlying injuries or physical 
disorders. Symptoms may also act as potential indicators of psychological or health issues in general. Bruises are 
another potential reason for additional medical testing recommended. The process of visually detecting and classifying 
bruises may be challenging for healthcare professionals since they frequently require a large degree of expertise in 
addition to the use of the individual's personal sense of judgment.  
Due to recent advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques, it is now feasible to automate the process 
of analyzing and identifying bruises. In this work, we present an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) that 
makes it possible to automatically recognize bruises on the human body. This is accomplished by utilizing the most 
recent iteration of the object identification approach known as You Only Look Once (YOLO) (Jocher et al. 2023) and 
then, it uses Case Based Reasoning CBR approach (Watson and Marir 1994) to search for the most similar cases in a 
database and provide suggestions based on the solutions of those cases. This methodology is intended to assist medical 
personnel, such as medical practitioners and nurses, in recognizing and assessing bruises in a timelier manner, thus 
improving the accuracy and objectivity of diagnosis. Consequently, this leads to improved patient care, reducing the 
time it takes to identify an injury, and avoiding the repercussions brought on by misdiagnosed or undiscovered injuries 
are all possible outcomes of introducing automated bruise recognition into clinical procedures and workflow.  
YOLO, the model and the detection system are explained by (Redmon et al. 2016), is an object detection algorithm 
that utilizes learning to identify objects, in images or videos. It stands out as a one-stage detection algorithm that

The results of the YOLOv8 show that there is potential for successful outcomes in terms of the rapid diagnosis of 
bruises without the need for complex equipment. The method can be used as an initial diagnostic tool for photographs 
of bruises, which can help provide timely and suitable medical treatment. Figure 6 shows the detection of bruises in 
the test images.  
 
 
Figure 6. Testing Result Samples 
 
One of the main advantages of using YOLO and CBR for medical image analysis is the ability to provide fast and 
accurate detection of abnormalities such as bruises, as well as the possibility of generating comments and severity 
scores and attaching them to the training process for each case. This adds another dimension to the diagnostic process, 
as it not only identifies the location and type of the abnormality or bruises, but also evaluates its severity and provides 
relevant instantaneous feedback. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Integrated Case-Based Reasoning and YOLO have been applied together as an approach to diagnosis and identification 
of bruises.  In this paper, we have proposed the CBR-YOLO approach for the identification of bruises.  There is one 
process that differs from the original case-based framework (YOLO prediction process).  
 
The result of the CBR-YOLO approach is quite significant decision-making for practitioners in the healthcare setting.  
Especially, it can give suggestions and comments although the bruises are similar in shape.  Consequently, the 
proposed methodology is beneficial for the diagnostic system.

 Abstract 
By mapping patterns of prescription diversities from health administered standards, this study reveals prescription 
diversity among patients diagnosed with cancer in a rural area of Thailand. The purpose of this study is to provide the 
groundwork for future research on the interaction between activity-related coverage and economic models of social 
health benefits. In order to understand how prescription variations affect patients, this study maps prescribing trends 
from electronic medical records to individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer symptoms. This study 
demonstrated how cloud computing and big data technologies may be effectively used to assist the transfer of data 
from local hospital databases to cloud databases. In actual cloud service implementations, this approach focuses on 
optimizing corresponding software performance and finance. Despite the stated prescription standards, this study may 
indicate that judgments made by health services programs for the treatment of chronic illnesses are subject to 
influence. One factor contributing to system inefficiency has been identified as a lack of care coordination, particularly 
when tests and treatments are repeated because the results are not shared across providers. There are more than 1,000 
preferred brand names and generic products for the treatment of chronic illnesses on the market for cancer therapies. 
This study utilizes multiple softwares to specify patterns of choices in order to prevent overprescribing and 
overdiagnosing because the list is triple-extended for non-preferred medications. The cost and profit associated with 
a drug's selection may be transformed into particular rules for programs managed by the health system. The results of 
this study suggested how recommendations specify medication orders for multiple coverage plans should be altered 
in order to uncover prescription trends in health administration programs, The association between benefit plan 
modification and reimbursement amount, as well as drug selection, dose, and manufacturer variability, were all 
quantified in the same illness using a regression model. The medical condition determines the amount per prescription, 
however the doctor may try to increase the dosage for the greatest possible benefit. The results are equivocal, but they 
also imply that alternative patient-type and brand selections result in better hospital benefit. The profitability of 
hospitals is significantly impacted by brand preference. The hospital's profit margins are larger when physicians are 
exposed to more brand alternatives, which may be the result of increasing brand rivalry. In the instance of 
hospitalization, the reimbursement index and the estimated dosage factor were both positive. According to this 
conclusion, more government reimbursements will result in a bigger profit margin for the hospital on each 
prescription. In order to comprehend the patterns of prescription for health services in Thailand, it may be useful to 
define the efficiency in healthcare procedures.

Abstract 
This study aims to optimize the efficiency of a high-traffic fuel station in Mumbai, India, by employing queuing theory 
and analyzing the service time distribution. Data was collected from a station with four fuel nozzles during rush hours, 
including inter-arrival times, service times, waiting times, fuel types, and vehicle types. Inter-arrival time data 
followed a Poisson distribution, while the service time data for each nozzle was analyzed using various distributions. 
The analysis revealed that the Weibull distribution provided the best fit for the service time data. This study utilized 
a multi-server queueing model (M/G/4) to calculate system utilization, waiting times, and the mean number of 
customers in the queue. According to the result, the model output was reasonably matched to observed data as the 
error percentage was found less than 20% for all output parameters. Several recommendations were made to optimize 
the fuel station, including automation, analysis, and maintenance. Practical implementation of low-budget 
modification and non-technical recommendations reduced the system’s waiting time by 22%. For long-term 
optimization, further data analysis and implementation of the recommendations are necessary. Nevertheless, this study 
provided valuable insights for fuel station operators in India.

1. Introduction
India is a largely populated country with a growing economy and with the advent of economic development, India has 
witnessed a profound transformation in both lifestyle and transportation systems, particularly in the context of its 
major urban centers (Chand  2019). As one of the business hubs and developed cities like greater Mumbai reported 
by India Times to have 4.3 million motor vehicles including buses, private cars, two-wheelers, and other fuel-driven 
vehicles in 2022 (Sen  2022), whereas despite the prevalence of electrical transport in western countries, till date 
approximately 90 percent of the vehicles in India consume petrol, diesel or CNG as fuel (Philip  2023).  
Per the official records of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of India, as documented in 2022, a comprehensive 
tally reveals the presence of 778 fuel stations situated across 278 distinct locations near, as well as within, Mumbai, 
Maharashtra. It is worth noting that these gas stations bear the responsibility of accommodating a considerably 
elevated load, with each station tasked with serving the needs of more than 550 vehicles uniformly. This imposes huge 
traffic for the stations, when in fact, the traffic is not uniform for all areas, i.e., Bandra, Worli, Mawai, etc., these 
commercial and high-income suburbs have more traffic than low-populated and low-income areas. The pronounced 
traffic experienced at gas stations in Mumbai engenders protracted customer queues, thereby conferring inconvenience 
upon individuals during rush hour periods and amidst the bustling lifestyle prevalent in the city (Figure 1).

5. Conclusion 
An Indian fuel station with a high volume of traffic had been analyzed using queuing theory and service time analysis. 
Inter-arrival time data followed a Poisson distribution, while nozzle service times followed a Weibull distribution. 
Fuel station operations needed to be modeled with accurate service time distributions. This study used a multi-server 
queuing model (M/G/4) to calculate system utilization, waiting times, and the mean number of customers in queue. 
Fuel station data showed a reasonable match between model output and observed data, indicating its applicability. 
Several recommendations were made based on the analysis- to optimize pumping speed, implement a queue 
management system, train staff cross-functionally, and use automated data analysis, payments could be streamed. 
Optimized performance and minimize service disruptions could also be achieved through predictive maintenance 
practices. Implementation of selected recommendations reduced the waiting time by 22.1687%. As a result of using 
queuing theory and service time analysis, this study contributed to fuel station optimization knowledge for Indian fuel 
stations. Other fuel station operators from India, especially Mumbai, could use these insights to cut wait times, improve 
productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction.

The rapid growth in the Indian construction industry has led to a need for efficient supply chain management and 
timely procurement of raw materials, particularly cement. Choosing suppliers is crucial to project completion, so a 
robust and reliable process is essential. The study proposed an application of the Triangular Fuzzy Technique for 
Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to address conflicts and uncertainties in supplier 
selection. In this study, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is employed to evaluate and rank potential cement 
suppliers on various criteria such as quality, delivery time, reliability, after-sales support, reputation, experience, etc. 
for Design Hub, Mumbai. The results consistently ranked ACC, Birla Corporation, and India Cement as top suppliers, 
even when reducing the set of criteria. Hence, this method for selecting suppliers under uncertain conditions was 
demonstrated as reliable and effective. Construction firms in India would be able to increase supply chain efficiency, 
reduce costs, and execute projects more efficiently with this approach by combining fuzzy logic with MCDM not only 
for cement but also for other construction material purchasing. Further exploration of fuzzy MCDM techniques was 
encouraged by these findings as this method of triangular fuzzy TOPSIS provided a robust and practical solution for 
choosing cement suppliers, ultimately resulting in improved project outcomes.

1. Introduction:
In recent decades, India has experienced unprecedented growth in the construction industry due to rapid urbanization 
and infrastructure development. Construction firms are under mounting pressure to optimize supply chains and ensure 
timely and reliable raw material procurement. A fundamental component of almost all construction projects, cement 
ranks highly among these raw materials, making supplier selection one of the most important factors. In recent years, 
the construction sector has witnessed remarkable expansion in India, contributing significantly to its economy 
(Bosworth & Collins, 2008). Construction firms face increased pressure to streamline operations and maximize 
efficiency as demand for quality infrastructure and real estate grows (Bertram et al. 2019). In the cement supply 
industry, supplier selection is key to successful completion. As part of the process, suppliers are identified that can 
meet the firm's specific requirements for cost, quality, delivery time, reliability, and after-sales service. An alternative 
approach to address conflicting criteria and uncertainty is the Triangular Fuzzy TOPSIS method.

Abstract 
The Philippines is one of the countries that is most susceptible to natural disaster. Flooding, in specific, has the second 
highest average annual natural hazard occurrence for 1980 to 2020. Inadequate drainage infrastructure and problems 
with waste disposal worsened the effects flooding in the Philippines. The government has tried various initiatives 
including routine desilting, declogging works, dredging, and enhancing culverts. However, the nature of the drainage 
system in the Philippines makes a comprehensive analysis of its state challenging. Moreover, maintaining drainage 
systems carelessly could endanger the community and put sanitary employees at risk for diseases.   
Therefore, the creation of a drainage probe robot has been made with the intention of replacing human labor with 
robot technology when examining the drainage system. This feasibility study involves analysis of the marketing, 
technical, management, legal and taxation, financial, and socio-economic desirability aspect of a drainage inspection 
service business. The drainage inspection service business will make use of the drainage probe robot in providing 
services. The study deployed survey questionnaires and interviewed the respondents. The data collected were analyzed 
using various techniques like qualitative demand analysis. The study also designed and described the service system 
and information system.  The findings show that the business concept alleviates the concern on endangering sanitary 
workers in doing the manual inspection and the problem on incomprehensible status of the drainage systems using the 
drainage probe robot in the inspection service.

1. Introduction
The Philippines is one of the countries that is most susceptible to natural disaster. Flooding, volcanic eruption, 
earthquakes, and typhoons have all hit the nation. These catastrophes have claimed tens of thousands of lives and 
billions of pesos in property damage (World Bank 2005; Philippine Statistics Authority  2020). Flooding, in specific, 
has the second highest average annual natural hazard occurrence for 1980 to 2020. Storms have been reported 276 
times, followed by 136 floods and 71 miscellaneous accidents (World Bank 2022). In the recent Typhoon Rai, 420,000 
hectares of land have been lost to storm floods, affecting 925,000 homes and agricultural crops (World Bank  2022). 
Another flood occurrence in Cebu province displaced over 800 people and affected 400 households (Floodlist in Asia 
2020).

Abstract 
The Philippines has been confronting a tremendous problem in its COVID-19 response. The country has adopted 
measures such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and forced wearing of masks to stop the spread of the illness. The 
objective of the study is to determine the efficiency rating among different provinces in Central Visayas based on the 
number of COVID-19 facilities, government expenditures, and bed capacity as main inputs and COVID-19 cases and 
mortality rate as main outputs.  The research made use of document analysis and desktop search in the data collection 
process and used the Constant-Return-to-Scale Data Envelopment Analysis model in the analysis. The results indicate 
that the efficiency rating of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Occidental is 13.07%, 7.47%, and 19.53% respectively. The 
results also showed that Siquijor has the highest technical efficiency and is the frontier for COVID-19 response in 
Central Visayas.

1. Introduction
The world economy and health have both been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The reaction to 
the pandemic has varied across nations, despite the efforts of governments and health groups. The effectiveness of 
decision-making units (DMUs), such as nations or provinces in a particular decision-making problem is assessed using 
the non-parametric approach known as data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA has been used in the framework of 
COVID-19 to assess how effectively nations have responded to the pandemic. According to a review of the literature 
on DEA studies on COVID-19 response, DEA can provide a thorough assessment of a nation's COVID-19 response 
by considering a variety of inputs, including health resources, economic resources, and policy measures, as well as a 
variety of outputs, including the number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and economic impact. 
1.1 Objectives 
The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 interventions in Region VII, Philippines and to 
pinpoint best practices and areas for development in stopping the virus's transmission and lessening its negative effects 
on society. Specifically, this study aims: 
1.
To determine the number of hospital beds, facilities, government spending, % case per population, number
of cases, number of COVID-19 deaths, and deaths-to-cases ratio among different provinces in Central
Visayas, Philippines
2.
To quantify the efficiency rating of each province related to COVID-19 responses

they are able to produce a given level of output with fewer inputs or produce a higher level of output with the same 
inputs, compared to the inefficient hospitals. In addition to the frontier, the DEA results could also provide a technical 
efficiency score for each hospital, which reflects the extent to which the hospital is operating efficiently compared to 
the frontier. A score of 1 indicates that the hospital is operating at the frontier and is technically efficient, while a score 
less than 1 indicates that the hospital can improve its efficiency by reducing its inputs or increasing its outputs. 
 
Based on the result of the analysis for Scenario 1 , Cebu (Efficiency Rating = 21.6%), Bohol (Efficiency Rating = 
74.7%), and Negros Occidental (Efficiency Rating = 71.4%) should consider increasing their facility utilization and 
decrease government expenditure. The same results are also shown in Scenario 2. However, the emphasis on scenario 
2 is that the gap between the output and input is high. For the benchmarking values in Figure 4, Cebu and Negros 
Occidental lag behind the other DMUs in terms of government expenditure and number of hospital beds relative to 
the population and number of cases. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
To improve COVID-19 response efficiency of the components of the Central Visayas region in the Philippines, the 
following recommendations are made: 
For Cebu 
• 
The government expenditure should be controlled by either reduction of up to 50.59% or increasing the 
hospital beds by 63.57%. 
For Bohol 
• 
The government expenditure should be controlled by reduction of up to 5.77%. 
For Negros Occidental 
• 
The government expenditure should be controlled by either reduction of up to 36.80% or increasing the 
hospital beds by 46.87%. 
As secondary recommendations, the researchers would like to explore other factors that may affect efficiency levels 
of the COVID-19 response such as the number of health workers, number of policies implemented for COVID-19 
Response, population density, patient-to-doctor ratio, and more. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Tables 1 and 2 outlined the different output and input levels as defined by the first objective of this research. Based 
on the DEA results, it has been found that Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Occidental are not operating at maximum 
efficiency. The results indicate that Cebu has the lowest technical efficiency of 7.47% followed by Bohol with 
technical efficiency of 13.07% and then Negros Occidental with technical efficiency of 19.53%. Also, for the third 
objective, recommendations are made under 5.3. Proposed Improvements for each component of Central Visayas, 
Philippines.

Abstract 
Purpose – This research examines risk management for service-oriented manufacturing supply 
chains via two stages, highlighting its differences from manufacturing. Initially, the authors 
review earlier studies in order to pinpoint the distinctive characteristics of service-oriented 
manufacturing supply chains and identify prevalent risks. Secondly, an empirical study in the 
construction field, which was heavily struck by the Covid-19 pandemic, is conducted to thoroughly 
inspect the resonant effect of these risks on service-oriented manufacturing supply chain 
performance. 
Design/methodology/approach – To validate the resonant effect mechanism, the theoretical 
model is compared to a newly created comparative model that encompasses the single effects of 
risks on supply chain performance.  
Findings – 63% variance of service-oriented manufacturing supply chain performance was 
explained by the resonant effect model, compared with 46.3% in the comparative model. 
Moreover, each risk exerts a more glaringly significant impact on supply chain performance, 
asserting the mechanism of the resonant influence. Another noteworthy result involves the demand 
risk possessing a low effect on supply chain performance, thus reinforcing the superiority of 
service-oriented manufacturing supply chains.  
Research limitations/implications – Future studies should discover optimal “resonant” models 
aiming at anticipating worst-case scenarios and safeguarding their supply chain. 
Practical implications – Indubitably, reducing the mechanism of the resonant effect will centre 
on lowering the coefficient of “α,” thereby restricting/eliminating the link among risks. Therefore,

Abstract 
This project aims to fabricate a scale model prototype of a machine that will serve as a waste collector and compactor 
for solid wastes that can efficiently prevent floods and preserve cleanliness. It will be an additional solution to reduce 
manual cleaning and the conventional use of nets to trap floating solid waste, which is unsafe for workers collecting 
garbage in canals. The proponents have considered different factors and options to determine the best possible features 
and the most feasible and reasonable design option. Trade-off analyses such as Technique for Order Preference by 
Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPIS) using Entropy and CRITIC (The Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria 
Correlation) and sensitivity analysis were also used to determine the best design option. Among all the 18 design 
options considered by the proponents, the fabricated prototype was based on Design Option 11 with Closeness 
Coefficients (Ci) of 0.75 (Entropy) and 0.66 (CRITIC). It utilized mild steel as the body frame material, the semi-
automated mechanism, and an electric linear actuator compactor system. This design project has accomplished the set 
objectives through testing, iterations, and statistical analyses. Furthermore, recommendations regarding the project's 
future improvements were provided, especially on its functions and features. These recommendations' main objective 
is to enhance the product's performance, durability, space utilization, holistic functionality, and lifespan.

1. Introduction
Open Canals are essential to daily life because they move water away, reducing flood dangers and the harm that 
flooding may inflict. However, as more garbage is illegally dumped into canals and streets, they become ineffective 
at preventing flooding, increasing the risk of communicable diseases such as water-borne diseases, viral and bacterial 
infections, and vector-borne diseases. Because of this, they start to pose a threat to the locals. Thus, the Department 
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) National Capital Region is taking measures, such as setting up 
garbage traps, clean-up drives, and hiring estero rangers to reduce the number of wastes ending up in Manila Bay. It 
keeps up with the ongoing initiatives to clean and restore the rivers and Esteros that feed into Manila Bay (DENR 
National Capital Region 2020). However, trash traps become ineffective since wastes are remobilized after it becomes 
full and may clog the waterways if not frequently collected. Also, the removal of the accumulated polluting material 
is challenging and time-consuming. It also increases health risks to workers while handling waste since it is already 
contaminated with various insects and other chemical substances. 
Moreover, the increasing amount of solid waste in the country makes it evident that although the Philippines has a law 
for waste management and has implemented initiatives to reduce plastic litter, it is still a problem for the environment 
because most individuals do not comply with or practice them. Tons of solid waste that are improperly disposed of 
wind up in canals, obstructing the rivers and causing flash floods, water contamination, and air pollution, particularly

• 
Another improvement of the machine that must be considered is the placement of the compactor machine, 
which should be downward to the bin since the waste overflows when it starts compacting. However, due to 
budget constraints, the proponents iterated the design and placed it on the back side of the bin. Thus, the size 
of the waste collector machine should be considered, especially the height of the downward placement of the 
compactor machine and how long it can stroke or push the object below.  
• 
For future project enhancements, the proponents recommended more testing regarding the speed of the 
conveyor machine, compactor machine, waste bin volume capacity, battery capacity, solar panel charging 
capability, and compactor's force in the actual place where there is an existing problem, such as clogged 
canals. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Using the TOPSIS Entropy and CRITIC weighting methods, the result shows that Design Option 11 was the best 
alternative to fabricate, garnering the highest Closeness Coefficients (Ci) of 0.75 and 066 respectively, among other 
design options. The proponents also conducted 15 trials to test the efficiency and productivity of the machine in terms 
of waste collection and compaction. The conveyor machine has an average speed of 153.31 seconds per 10 revolutions 
(one trial), given that there is no load or waste on the collector jaw. Succeeding, an average of 166.80 seconds is 
required when there is an increasing load (waste) from 1 kg to 20 kg accumulated per trial. It can also be seen in their 
average that there is a significant difference, and the load causes changes in the speed of the conveyor machine. It also 
indicates that there is a need for improvement in the motor power and load capacity used. Moreover, the proponents 
concluded that the machine could accumulate up to 194.24 kilograms of waste per hour. Compared to the data from 
the manual collection during the clean-up drive at Esteros in Metro Manila, the result shows a 1,439.17% increase. It 
is because the machine can accumulate 582.80 kg per three hours compared to a person with an average of 37.86 kg 
of waste. It means that the machine can help users save time since it can collect more waste continuously than manual 
collection since individuals have more time bottlenecks and allowances, such as fatigue, delay, and personal 
allowance. However, the speed of machine collection may still vary depending on the weight of solid waste. 
 
On the other hand, it is observed that the compactor machine speed changes from its initial speed of 127.23 seconds 
(without load) to an average of 116.90 seconds when the proponents tested it with 0.1 kg waste (combination of 
plastics and metal cans), which the time became faster. It might be due to no load being compacted, keeping the 
compactor machine continuing until it reaches the end side of the waste bin. Another factor is the machine's limited 
power capacity, which needs to be improved with higher motor power capacity. Human errors (such as late clicking 
of timestamp) might also be one of the factors why the time for with load is faster and varies than without load. 
Nonetheless, the speed of the compactor machine did not show a significant relationship to the combination of waste 
materials (plastics and metal cans) accumulated in terms of mass percentage. It also shows that speed is consistent 
using the different percentages of waste combinations and does not significantly affect the speed in 15 trials. In terms 
of battery life, both systems of the machine (compactor and collector systems) can utilize the full spread of 100% 
given that they are working alternately and a rate of 80% without the support battery pack.

1. Introduction
Employees are the company's most valuable resource. Employees who always play an active role in achieving 
company goals as planners, implementers, and even controllers. Employees cannot be replaced by other resources, so 
businesses must be able to manage them effectively (Saragih, F. H 2019). No matter how advanced the technology is 
or how much money is set aside if there is no team able to support it as employees are now expected to become more 
inventive and creative, it is imperative for companies to develop their human resources in a variety of ways, including 
through competitive hiring and onboarding processes, systematic training, higher levels of employee satisfaction, 
increased level of employee education and employee empowerment

at work but if the work culture is not good then automatically it indirectly has an impact on employee satisfaction. 
 
The Effect of Work Pressure to Employee Satisfaction. The results showed that there was a positive influence 
between work pressure on employee satisfaction and statistically it can be stated that there is a significant influence 
between work pressure on employee satisfaction. This means that the higher the work pressure, the more employee 
satisfaction increases.  
 
The Effect of Employee Satisfaction to Work Productivity. The results showed that there was a positive influence 
between employee satisfaction on work productivity and statistically significant. This means that the higher employee 
satisfaction, the work productivity will also increase. Job satisfaction refers to a person's affective response to a task, 
including overall attitude toward work, formed through an assessment of various work-related factors. A person's 
work attitude includes both positive and negative encounters and is also related to their future prospects. When a 
person is satisfied with their work, they tend to feel joy regardless of feeling depressed. This, in turn, encourages a 
sense of security and comfort, thus creating a pleasant work environment. 
 
The Effect of Work Culture to Work Productivity. The results showed that there was a negative influence between 
work culture on work productivity and was statistically insignificant. This means that there is no significant influence 
between work culture and work productivity. Organizational culture is a part of organizational life that affects the 
behavior, attitudes and performance of all employees. The relationship with the implementation of organizational 
culture is still weak, which is reflected in the decline in work ethic and employee work discipline.  The role of 
leadership is very important in creating or improving work culture in a company to be able to increase the company's 
work productivity. If employees who work in an institution are able to implement a quality work culture, of course, it 
can also increase work productivity. 
 
The Effect of Work Pressure to Work Productivity. The results showed that there is a positive influence between 
work pressure on work productivity and statistically it can be stated that there is a significant influence between work 
pressure on work productivity. This means that there is a positive relationship between work pressure and work 
productivity, indicating that work pressure increases, so does work productivity. Pressure is more often associated 
with demands and resources. The concept of pressure is often described negatively, but it is important to know that 
pressure can also give positive results. There are several factors that affect individual work productivity, including but 
not limited to organizational work pressure. In particular, when employees experience increased work pressure, this 
tends to have a negative impact on their overall performance. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the study, the conclusions obtained from this study were from 202 respondents studied, it was 
found that: 
1. 
Work culture has a negative and insignificant effect on employee satisfaction and work productivity, meaning 
that work culture has no effect on PT Bara Permata Mining employee satisfaction. This means that the indication 
of the implementation of work culture is still felt to be less strong so that it shows a decrease in morale and work 
discipline of its employees and work culture is not needed in research in this company because the system has 
been running using Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that have been applied in each department so that the 
work culture itself runs in accordance with the existing system. 
2. 
Work pressure has a positive and significant effect on employee satisfaction. This means that the higher the work 
pressure given will have an impact on employee satisfaction. The pressure referred to here is a work target that 
has been determined by management so that when the target has been achieved, the level of employee satisfaction 
with their work will increase.  
3. 
Job satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on work productivity. This means that the higher the level 
of job satisfaction, the more employee work productivity increases. 
4. 
Work pressure has a positive and significant effect on work productivity. This means that the higher the work 
pressure given, the more employee work productivity increases. 
5. 
The results showed that job satisfaction can mediate between work culture, work pressure and employee 
productivity so that job satisfaction is a good intervening variable.

Abstract 
The development of charging infrastructure plays a crucial role in facilitating the widespread adoption of electric 
vehicles (EVs). This research examines the regulatory and policy obstacles that impact the establishment of a 
sustainable business model for public EV charging infrastructure in developing countries. Governments across the 
globe are actively pursuing the objective of electrifying their transport systems in response to the pressing concern 
about climate change. To accomplish these goals, the government agencies are offering monetary incentives to 
facilitate the establishment and expansion of public EV charging infrastructure. In spite of this, the spread of public 
electric vehicle charging infrastructure in a number of developing nations is still sluggish and constrained. This study 
provides an overview of the policies implemented in developing countries in South Asia and emphasises the 
importance of regulations that address the sustainability and techno-economic feasibility of public electric vehicle 
charging infrastructure businesses. It also examines the various factors, both direct and indirect, that impact the 
sustainability of EV charging businesses. The findings suggest that the long-term viability of charging enterprises 
relies on key factors such as technical standardisation, interoperability, and electric vehicle charging tariffs. The 
research additionally emphasises the financial and technical barriers that impede the progress of charging 
infrastructure development. The results of this research will provide valuable insights for governmental entities in 
formulating cost-effective approaches to achieve their e-mobility goals and support the growth of electric vehicle 
charging businesses.

Abstract 
Social Media Marketing is an effort to better understand the dynamics of effective strategies in modern business.  The 
purpose of the study was to determine and analyse the relationship between Social Media Marketing, Customer 
Retention, mediated by Customer Engagement for Shopee e-commerce users in Palembang City. This research 
explores the role of social media marketing in maintaining Shopee's customer continuity, customer engagement is a 
key element in the link between social media marketing strategies and customer retention. The research method was 
implemented through a quantitative approach using a survey as the research design. The unit of analysis of the research 
was Shopee e-commerce users in Palembang City with a total of 130 respondents. The data analysis technique was 
carried out with the SEM-PLS approach to conduct hypothesis testing. The findings of Social Media Marketing proved 
to have no direct effect on Customer Retention (38.9%), but Social Media Marketing has a positive influence on 
Customer Engagement by (97.2%) and the relationship between customer engagement and Customer Retention by 
(0.56%). The results of the mediation test state that Customer Engagement successfully mediates the relationship 
between Social Media Marketing to Customer Retention with a relatively low mediation effect.  The implications of 
these findings provide opportunities for Marketing Managers to develop more effective marketing strategies through 
social media platforms and increase interaction with customers, in order to increase Customer Engagement. The 
research results can be used by Shopee e-commerce Marketing Managers to design more targeted marketing 
campaigns and improve understanding of customer behaviour and needs through analysis of the data generated. The 
implications of this research also encourage the training and development of marketing teams to improve the 
effectiveness of their performance and adopt a data-driven decision-making approach in future marketing strategies.

Introduction 
The latest business opportunities are created by the development of Industrial Environment 4.0. Today, transactions 
are digitized and easier to conduct. Thanks to this technological innovation, a number of e-commerce (electronic 
commerce) businesses have sprung up. An e-commerce business is a commercial transaction that involves the 
exchange of value between individuals using digital technology (Huang 2021; Laudon & Traver 2019; Ma & Hu, 
2021; Rachmad  2022). 
Customer retention maintenance is an indispensable aspect of e-commerce business to retain customers. The 
achievement of customer retention takes place when the company is able to develop, maintain, and protect a positive 
relationship between the customer and the company, another term for this is customer engagement (Kadek & Martini, 
2022). Social Media becomes very important for e-commerce companies in increasing Customer Engagement so that 
positive relationships are formed, making consumers not only act as buyers but also as marketers for companies (Arora 
et al.  2021; Wahid & Gunarto 2022).

Based on Table 7, there is one hypothesis relationship that is not accepted, namely, it does not show a direct positive 
and significant influence relationship between Social Media Marketing on Cutomer Retention which shows:  
1. Social Media Marketing affects Customer Retention by 0.389 (38.9%), which is statistically significant because 
the t-count value is 1.858 (smaller than 1.96). This condition indicates that if social media marketing is good, 
then customers will try to stay. 
2. Social Media Marketing has an effect on Customer Engagement of 0.973 (97.3%), which is statistically 
significant because the t-count value is 135.68 (less than 1.96) or the p-value is 0.136 (greater than 5%). These 
results indicate that social media marketing can improve and strengthen the relationship between Shopee and 
Shopee customers/app users.  
3. Customer Engagement has a positive effect on Customer Retention with a value of 0.56 (0.56%), statistically 
significant because the t-count value is 2.736 (greater than 1.96) This condition indicates that Customer 
Engagement can influence and increase the level of customer retention. 
4. There is a Positive Effect of Customer Engagement on Social Media Marketing and Customer Retention with 
a value of 0.007. This condition indicates that the mediation effect is positive and significant, Customer 
Engagement succeeds in becoming an intermediary variable for the relationship between Social Media 
Marketing and Customer Retention.

Abstract 
This paper investigates a dynamic food delivery problem, in which orders arrive dynamically and must be delivered 
to customers within specified time windows. A fleet of capacitated vehicles is used to deliver the orders. The goal is 
to minimize the total transportation distances associated with fulfilling customer demands on time. The authors 
propose a methodology for solving this problem, which involves two steps: 1) Order grouping: the orders are grouped 
into sets based on their arrival time and delivery time windows. 2) Route optimization: for each set of orders, an 
optimal delivery route is found using a CVRPTW model. We evaluate the methodology using experimental results. 
We found that the decision timeframe (the length of time over which orders are grouped) has a significant impact on 
the performance of the methodology. When the decision timeframe is narrower, it tends to require a higher number of 
vehicles compared to wider time frames. However, it also results in a shorter average waiting time for customers. With 
a wider timeframe, more options for orders can be combined in one delivery routing, which can reduce the travel 
cost/distance. However, too wide a timeframe may lead to increased travel distances due to a small gap between the 
time of decision making and the guaranteed time of delivery.

1. Introduction
Customer experience is the most crucial component in a highly competitive market for food delivery services. 
Therefore, having a reliable delivery system that guarantees timely and fresh food delivery is essential to ensure 
customer satisfaction. Consequently, the utilization of efficient transportation and the development of suitable 
planning methodologies can help companies maintain their competitive edge. 
In the aftermath of the COVID-19 incident, a significant number of people have turned to applications, websites, or 
phone calls to order food, eliminating the need to personally visit restaurants (Zhou He and Guanghua Han 2019). 
However, customers also expect prompt service and dislike waiting for extended periods. Technological 
advancements and the emergence of delivery platforms like Grab, UberEATS, Food panda, Shopee Food, and others 
have played a pivotal role in driving the growth of online food delivery services (Tsan-Ming Choi, Shu Guo, Na Liu, 
and Xiutian Shi 2020). These platforms empower customers to effortlessly browse through a diverse selection of 
restaurants, choose their desired dishes, and enjoy swift food delivery. This service provides customers with 
convenience and a wide range of options, enabling them to order food from numerous restaurants with just a simple 
tap on their smartphones.  Consequently, food delivery services face the fundamental challenge of ensuring efficient 
delivery in the face of high order volumes, tight timelines, and complex traffic conditions. They are required to make 
high-quality decisions within limited time frames, simultaneously meeting the demands for both immediacy and 
quality since the speed and accuracy of order delivery significantly impacts customer satisfaction (Yi Ding, Xing Gao, 
Chao Huang, Jia Shu, and Donghui Yang 2018). 
Order management in food delivery services is the process of receiving, processing, and fulfilling orders. It involves 
several steps, including: 1) Order intake: this is the process of receiving orders from customers. This can be done 
through a variety of channels, such as a website, mobile app, or phone call. 2) order verification: this is the process of 
verifying that the order is complete and accurate. This includes checking the customer's address, the type and quantity

5. Conclusion 
In food delivery management, effective decision-making plays a crucial role in achieving desirable outcomes. The 
challenge lies in creating an optimal delivery route that strikes a balance between transportation distances and 
customer satisfaction.  The algorithm proposed in the paper is a promising approach for solving the problem with 
dynamic order arrivals in food delivery. The algorithm can make decisions in real time, and it is able to adapt to 
changes in the environment. This makes it a good candidate for use in real-world applications. 
 
The paper's findings can be used to inform the development of more sophisticated algorithms for food delivery. By 
understanding the optimal length of time for grouping orders, food delivery companies can minimize transportation 
distances and time, and improve the delivery experience for their customers.  As the guaranteed time increases, the

maximum length of the time horizon can be increased. This is because there is more time available to combine orders 
and ensure that they are delivered on time.  However, travel time also affects the maximum length of the time horizon. 
If the travel time is longer, then the maximum length of the time horizon must be shorter to ensure that orders are 
delivered on time. 
 
The assumption that there is only one restaurant simplifies the problem, but it also makes it less realistic. In the real 
world, food delivery companies need to consider a variety of factors when determining the proper kitchen to make a 
given order. These factors include the customer's location, the availability of kitchens, the estimated cooking time, 
and the cost of delivery.  This assumption should be relaxed in future study. 
 
In exploring the complexities of food delivery management, the paper introduces a robust algorithm for order 
dispatching and delivery decisions. However, to enhance its practical value, a deeper examination of real-time 
constraints and economic factors could be beneficial. Real-time constraints, inherent in dynamic order arrivals and 
varying delivery windows, could be further investigated to reveal how the algorithm effectively adapts to these 
uncertainties. Analyzing its responsiveness to sudden demand spikes, unforeseen delays, and changing traffic 
conditions would underscore its real-world applicability. Additionally, delving into economic implications would offer 
a broader perspective. While the paper outlines the algorithm's impact on distances and waiting times, a comprehensive 
economic analysis could highlight potential cost savings and revenue growth. Evaluating aspects like fuel expenses, 
labor costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction could underscore the algorithm's tangible benefits for food delivery 
companies. By exploring scenarios of economic uncertainty and demonstrating how the algorithm optimally allocates 
resources under varying conditions, Examining the total economic distance from the reference point to point 7322.07 
unveils an interesting comparison when juxtaposed against the illustrative example of a 30-minute time frame with a 
90-minute delivery guarantee.  
 
In this context, the calculated economic distance of 7322.07 units represents a distinctive route's efficiency from a 
cost perspective. Contrasting this with the total distance of 3511 units in the illustrative scenario further highlights the 
economic implications of altering delivery parameters. The comparison accentuates the intricate interplay between 
time constraints and economic considerations in the realm of food delivery operations. It sheds light on the intricate 
balance that businesses must navigate – maximizing efficiency while upholding delivery commitments. This analysis 
contributes to the broader discourse on optimizing logistics and underscores the significance of factoring in economic 
considerations when designing delivery routes within specific time parameters. The paper could provide actionable 
insights for real-world implementations. This integration of real-time adaptability and economic considerations would 
amplify the algorithm's relevance and value, catering to the nuanced needs of food delivery operations. The paper 
could have offered a more holistic guide for decision-makers in the food delivery landscape.

Abstract 
The researchers developed an upgraded food packaging that can detect food spoilage. The research was inspired by the 
present issues in the industry regarding food waste and food safety. This endeavor is driven by three Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) with an objective for all nations to have a common goal that will lead to stability and 
economic growth. Qualitative and quantitative methods were utilized in this study, specifically interviews and surveys. 
The qualitative approach was used to gather insights from experts for technology development. A survey was conducted 
to determine relevant information regarding the market. The survey was also utilized for validation from consumers and 
for determining the product's market viability. About 100 respondents from the National  Capital Region participated in 
the study. The technical feasibility aspect of the product was determined through product testing in the Department of 
Science and Technology-Industrial Technology Development Institute (DOST-ITDI), preliminary manufacturing, and 
production assessment. Based on the initial manufacturing assessment, the daily yield is 200 units and 4,400 units 
monthly. This study was viewed to be viable because it has a payback period of one year and seven months. The startup 
business begins with modest profits and sales but progressively grows over the years, leading to higher sales, profits, 
and positive cash flow.

1. Introduction
The development of a food container with a spoilage detector called “Waste Not “was driven by the need to address 
specific issues related to the packaging and food industry. These issues are food waste and food safety. Food waste is a 
severe problem that affects the economy, environment, and society. It significantly contributes to global issues such as 
climate change and pollution. According to Lewis (2022), food that has been allowed to rot in landfills emits methane, 
which is twenty-five times more potent than carbon dioxide and contributes about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions 
worldwide. Another problem in the industry that is crucial to maintain and that prompted the development of a spoilage 
detector is food safety. According to Hanson (2021), the repercussions of food safety issues may result in minor to fatal 
outcomes for both consumers and food business owners. For consumers, it may be mild abdominal pain and diarrhea to 
debilitating infections and chronic illnesses, while for business owners, it may be its reputation and future. Upon 
identifying these two issues, the researchers seek to find a solution to help address the said problems. The initiative also 
supports three Sustainable Development Goals: Sustainable Cities and Communities, Partnership for the Goals, and 
Responsible Consumption and Production. 
The packaging industry in the Philippines is one of the industries that have a considerably good market. In particular, 
the demand for food containers is rapidly growing because proper packaging tremendously improves the shelf life of a 
food product. In the specific instance of the project, Waste Not’s goal is to provide a food container with the capacity 
to identify food spoiling, track the shelf life of food to prevent food waste and check the food's humidity and temperature 
conditions. The Waste Not is a food container that can detect food spoilage, and it comes with an application that can 
monitor the real-time status of the food. Users will be notified about the food status

Note: Values in PH Peso; 1 USD is equal to 55.28 PH Peso as of June 30, 2023. 
 
Table 6 shows the break-even analysis in units and pesos. The break-even in units for year one is 26,482, while the 
break-even in pesos is 19.8 million. This indicates the number of units to be sold and how much sales to be earned to 
cover the production costs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
After using both qualitative and quantitative techniques, the product, WasteNot is considered marketable since the 
majority of the respondents are willing to buy and use the product. It also shows that most of the respondents find it 
difficult to identify food spoilage, thus validating the need for the development of a food container with a spoilage 
detector. 
 
The product is feasible because based on the initial and final testing of the device, it has met the working conditions 
proposed. Also, under the financial aspect, the payback period of the product produced significant results. 
Furthermore, the target market, or consumers' response to the survey, was in favor of buying the product. 
 
Developing a product that can detect food spoilage easily and aids people in monitoring the real-time status of their 
food can positively impact the environment by reducing one of the main contributors of waste, which is food waste. 
At the same time, through WasteNot, people can better ensure food safety consumption. Occurrences of food poisoning 
can be prevented if people are able to detect spoiled food accurately. Pursuing the production of WasteNot can also 
create more job opportunities for individuals, which can then impact the country's economy. 
 
The researchers suggest exploring other indicators of spoilage, such as halochromic ink and other gas sensors. 
According to Leite et al. (2022), halochromic sensors, specifically methyl orange and bromocresol purple 2% (w/v), 
were able to create a perceptible signal that indicates food spoilage through a color change. Another recommendation 
is to test the food spoilage detector on raw meat or fish. The researchers also propose to explore using solar power to 
operate the product. Solar energy is proven to be a sustainable energy source, and at the same time, it has a lower 
impact on the environment than other energy sources (Johnston 2022). Another proposed improvement is utilizing 
LoRa technology to improve the battery life of the product. According to Garcia et al. (2019), LoRa consumes less 
power than WiFi, although there should be necessary changes in its settings to ensure low energy consumption.

Abstract 
Digitalization is vital in today's industries, yet it brings the risk of unemployment due to decreased jobs. Indonesia 
counters this via the Indonesia 4.0 roadmap, boosting micro-enterprises, and encouraging tech-related investments. 
MSMEs are still faced a problem about financing which results in them not being able to develop innovations to 
increase production due to the very limited use of technology. On the other hand, financial technology (fintech) was 
growing rapidly in the 2017-2021 period. However, 74% of MSMEs did not yet have access to finance, indicating a 
discrepancy between the use of fintech in Indonesia and the understanding of society, especially MSMEs, regarding 
financial inclusion. In fact, financial inclusion has a direct and significant positive effect on business sustainability 
practices on MSME performance. Business continuity practices are carried out by identifying and supporting the 
factors that motivate MSMEs in economic growth. This study aims to evaluate the effect of financial technology 
innovation through business continuity practices on the performance of MSMEs in Karawang Regency using the non-
probability sampling method with convenience sampling technique on 100 MSME respondents using the SEM-PLS 
method. The results showed that environment affects business continuity and perceived industry pressure but does not 
affect the use of fintech and perceived government; organization affects business sustainability but does not affect the 
use of fintech; technology affects perceived direct and perceived indirect but does not affect the use of fintech; and 
MSME performance is only influenced by the use of fintech and is not affected by business sustainability.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 is a concept of smart manufacturing where rapid advances in manufacturing technology and applications 
help increase productivity (Vaidya, Ambad and Bhosle 2018). Digitalization, besides having great potential, also has 
negative impacts, namely disruption, such as unemployment due to reduced employment, resulting in an increasingly 
complex level of competition (Prasetyo and Sutopo 2018; Prasetyo and Trisyanti 2018). This has prompted the 
Indonesian government to formulate a strategy to deal with threats through the launch of the Indonesia 4.0 roadmap 
(Satya, 2018). The initial steps in the roadmap for Indonesia 4.0 include (1) empowering micro, small, and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs) and (2) giving incentives for technology investment in the use of technology that is relevant to 
the focus of this research (Indonesia, 2019). Research Wibowo (2019) supported this concept.

Abstract 
After the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been observed that companies should employ sustainability in the packaging 
supply chain (PSC) to reduce waste and safeguard the environment. Packaging plays a major role in producing 
municipal waste, so we proactively need some major solutions to overcome this problem. Industrialized nations 
generate a significant part of packaging waste compared to developing nations. Developed countries are 
significantly trying to overcome this problem by implementing sustainable packaging in their businesses. By 
implementing sustainable packaging alternatives, concrete steps can be made to reduce the overall waste and 
pollution produced by traditional packaging, but in developing nations like India, it remains a challenge to explore 
this issue. This study attempts to discover the critical barriers to sustainability in PSC in developing economies. 
A total of 27 critical barriers were identified through the peer-reviewed articles and expert inputs, and these are 
categorized into six main barriers. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, called Best Worst 
Method (BWM), is employed to analyze the data obtained from the expert. The BWM method prioritizes the 
barriers to sustainability in PSC according to their degree of influence. The BWM results show that the most 
significant barriers were organizational barriers that must be taken as a major challenge towards achieving 
sustainability in PSC. After that, the significant barriers were the material barriers, financial barriers, logistical 
barriers, technological barriers, and independent barriers that have considerable impact on the performance of the 
enterprise. These results will help practitioners, industrial managers, and executives make planning, regulations 
and policies while implementing sustainability in PSC.

Abstract 
Improving sustainability performance across the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), which encompasses social, 
environmental, and economic aspects, is crucial for companies operating in the manufacturing sector. Particularly in 
countries with emerging economies, there is a significant demand for responsible and sustainable business practices. 
Using a Thai manufacturing company case study, this study investigates the synergies and trade-offs among TBL 
dimensions. Additionally, the study explores the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies and Circular Economy (CE) 
practices on these synergies and trade-offs. A qualitative method, specifically a semi-structured interview, was 
adopted in this study. The findings indicate that the performance of economic and environmental dimensions is more

than social performance. While the company realizes the importance of all TBL dimensions, due to the highly 
competitive nature of the business, the economic aspect tends to be the leading dimension of the TBL that the company 
prioritizes. The impacts of Industry 4.0 technologies on TBL performance improvement are summarized in Table 3.

systems.
The company believes that Industry 4.0 technologies and CE practices are vital for long-term business survival. To 
promote CE implementation success, the company notices that stakeholders’ participation is essential to transition 
toward the CE, aligning with the previous study (Gupta et al. 2019). Although the company recognizes obvious 
synergy between economic and environmental dimensions, there is still an existing trade-off between these 
dimensions. The company needs to recognize long-term benefits of improving environmental performance. The 
company also reveals that stakeholders within the company’s ecosystem need to first recognize and then perceive the 
value of the TBL benefits for sustainable development. It is also crucial to ensure employees’ understanding of 
Industry 4.0 technologies to smoothly adapt to the Industry 4.0 environment (Majumdar et al. 2021). In the long run, 
the company sees the benefits of promoting TBL performances to ensure sustainable development. The interesting 
findings of this study which may be applicable to the manufacturing sector of other developing countries are 
summarized as the followings. 
•
Industry 4.0 implementation provides benefits for all TBL dimensions.
•
Among the TBL benefits, the performances of economic and environmental dimensions are more tangible
than that of social dimension. Hence, it is still difficult for a company to recognize the social implications of
its operations.
•
Sustainability improvement is the long-term process. A well-structured plan for recovering investments in
Industry 4.0 technologies and the CE is essential for a company committed to long-term sustainability
improvement.
In conclusion, our study promotes the understanding of the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies and CE practices on 
TBL performances in the Thai manufacturing context through a case study of a metal manufacturing company. The 
synergies and trade-offs among TBL dimensions are highlighted. The findings of this study can help manufacturing 
companies properly allocate their sustainable development efforts among the TBL dimensions. Industrialists and 
practitioners could utilize the findings to help enhance the sustainability performance of manufacturing companies. 
Future studies can engage in a broader industrial sector, e.g., other manufacturing industries. A survey-based study 
could also help advance the understanding and generalize the findings on the synergies and trade-offs among the TBL 
dimensions of the manufacturing industries.

Abstract 
This research sought to improve the assembly process, specifically from the desktop computers of the Infotec 
company, from the implementation of lean tools that allow diagnosing, measuring, and implementing new 
improvements or modifications in certain stages in order to improve both the level of service and the lead time of the 
total process. Each stage of the process had to be analyzed together with the company's technicians in order to obtain 
information on the current situation. Among the main findings, the lack of updated work tools, poor organization of 
the workshop and a moderate amount of lead time were identified, this through the use of the Pareto Diagram, DOP, 
VSM, DAP and photographic evidence. In addition, a high expense was found in complaints that represents 30% of 
the fixed costs, which corresponds to the internal failures of the computer, due to the poor assembly of the components, 
the overtime, and the poor organization of the workshop. Therefore, the lean tools used were Six Sigma, SMED and 
Poka Yoke. These allowed to propose new improvements and modifications both in the assembly process and in the 
work area. The Arena software was used to capture the current situation and later a new one, with the improvements 
implemented, evidencing an improvement of approximately 20 minutes. This investigation had certain drawbacks at 
first, as the company made it difficult to collect data to obtain the current situation. However, it was managed to settle 
it through negotiation.

1. Introduction
The different sectors that Peru represents are distributed mainly in 3, which are the primary sector (7.6%), secondary 
(32.7%), and tertiary (59.9%), ""The manufacturing sector is within of the secondary sector which grew by 13.3% in 
2021” (MEF, Evolución del Sector Manufacturero, 2021). ""Peru ranked sixth in the manufacturing position with 1.6% 
in Latin America in 2022, with positive expectations for 2025 with 2.1%, ranking fifth in Latin America"" 
(FocusEconomics  2022). 
The way in which it operates and carries out its activities in this case study is the Make to order (MTO) type, since it 
produces products based on customer orders. This way is defined by Kalpakjian & R. Schmid (2014) as: 
""The total assembly operation is usually broken down into other individual ones, with an operator assigned to execute 
each stage. Traditionally, assembly involves a lot of manual labor and therefore contributed significantly to the cost 
of the product""(p.14) 
The GDP in Peru according to the BCR in 2023 is 223.2 billion dollars, and according to MEF forecasts, it will 
continue to grow. “The GDP will greatly exceed what we had programmed. Although the percentage of growth comes 
out a little less than the forecast, it must be considered that it is on a greater amount” (MEF  2023). 
The Infotec company offers products such as computers, computer components, and services such as maintenance and 
assembly of PCs. The goal of the Infotec company is to provide high-quality technological products, with full

The income is determined by the impact that was left to have and the expenses by the cost of the implementation. 
6. Conclusion 
With the present investigation, the objectives of correcting, eliminating, and improving the operational deficiencies 
of the assembly of a computer were achieved in order to be able to witness the increase in customer satisfaction. The 
times, resources and routes of each activity were determined with different diagnostic tools for further analysis, with 
this improvement proposals were prepared for the company Infotec, with engineering tools such as Six sigma, SMED 
and Poka Yoke. Finally, a simulation was implemented with the arena software capable of carrying out tests before 
the improvement to verify the current situation of the company and to be able to make subsequent changes. In the first 
instance, the costs of the main problem were S/ 25,830 per year and the implementation of the improvement for this 
project is S/ 5,116, which includes S/ 1,600 for the sizing sensors to implement the Poka Yoke, S/ 3,000 for the 
electrical restructuring of the luminaire and finally the 4 automated tools that would give an equivalence of S/ 516. 
By making these improvements, the Infotec group would be committing itself to sustainability and this can be verified 
by its actions, the economic impact that had reduced the costs of optimizing certain activities of the process, the social 
impact, which includes the company's workers in the improvements that would be implemented, as they would feel 
part of the change and achievements of the company, and the environmental impact of the implementation of led 
spotlights, it would be contributing in a safe and competitive environment, improving the reputation of the company 
against the competition. Finally, it is concluded that the improvements that occurred were improve the total time of 
the process, improve the organization of the workshop and reduce the expenses of the company. However, some 
continuity or consistency must be established with the long-term improvements to determine the reliability of the 
improvements implemented in this project, so that new complementary tools can be implemented and that the research 
can work in a better way.

Abstract  
The commercial sector has evolved since it has increased by 1.24% compared to the 2022 periods; however, automotive 
trade decreased by 2.16%. This behavior happened, since the economy in 2022 was affected by the continuity of social 
demonstrations. This research analyzes and studies the distribution and inventory management of a warehouse using the 
ABC, Slotting and EOQ tools to increase productivity in the dispatch area; this has a technical gap of 55% with respect to 
the sector, which currently has a productivity of 2.9. Through the implementation of the proposed model, it was possible to 
reorganize the warehouse, optimize the stock to meet the demand and achieve the target objectives, since the productivity 
increased by 43.79%, the operational efficiency increased by 65%, the Stock breaks were reduced by 63% and returns of 
wrong products decreased by 6.2%. It should be noted that the results obtained were validated by a software called Arena 
and an economic evaluation.

1. Introduction
Globally, the productivity of the commercial sector has contributed approximately one third of economic growth, 
similar to the case of East Asian middle-income countries such as Thailand. Production per worker is only 25% of that 
of the United States, and is slightly lower than those of Chile and Mexico; Likewise, the productivity of the country's 
companies is comparable to that of similar middle-income countries, such as Malaysia and South Africa, but the 
productivity of a company in Peru is barely 5% of the level of the world productivity frontier and it is similar to the 
levels registered in Colombia (5.5%) and Mexico (8.5%). Likewise, the economy of Peru has grown at a faster rate 
than that of more developed countries, which is why economic convergence has accelerated. During the years from 
1960 to 1990, the convergence was slow and even negative in some stages. During that period, other countries, 
including the middle-income countries of East Asia, advanced in their convergence, leaving Peru behind. In the last 
decade, however, Peru's per capita income has been increasing rapidly with that of high-income countries and, although 
starting from a low base, it is reaching the speed of convergence of countries such as Malaysia and Thailand. But like 
other middle-income countries, Peru now faces the most difficult challenge of becoming a high-income country (World 
Bank 2015). 
According to the literature review, the problem of low productivity in the dispatch area is identified, which may be 
due to inadequate design of the layout of facilities, low operational efficiency, lack of control indicators, returns, stock 
breaks, storage, among others. others. In addition, this problem was also found in other investigations; For example, 
that of a Peruvian company importing and trading auto parts, which had a productivity below 40% of the optimal 8 
pieces/H-H, this did not allow them to meet customer satisfaction levels (León et al. 2022). On the other hand, 
according to (Rivera et al. 2022) the productivity of the picking process is important for the entire operation of the 
office and its economic performance. The aforementioned demonstrates that auto parts trading companies present 
inefficient processes, which is why it is necessary to propose new solutions to this problem.

efficiency of 10.21%; Furthermore, in accordance with the provisions, it was possible to reduce returns for erroneous 
products from 10% to 3.8%, thus exceeding the target by 0.2%. 
 
• Through the effective application of the Economic Purchase Order (EOQ) strategy, a significant reduction in the 
frequency of stock-outs was achieved, going from 118 to 44 cases per year. It is important to highlight that, although 
the established goal was 39 breaks, the results obtained are remarkably close to this optimum figure. This improvement 
translates into greater stability in the supply of products and a firm step towards the optimization of inventory 
management 
 
• By applying the ABC tool and carrying out a successful simulation that involved both the Slotting approach and the 
calculation of the Economic Purchase Order (EOQ), a notable increase in the productivity of the dispatch area was 
achieved, rising from 2.9 to 4.17. Although this value does not exactly match the target set of 4.5, it is close to the 
target and shows substantial progress in optimizing processes. These improvements are reflected in greater efficiency 
in resource management and a significant step towards operational excellence in the dispatch area. 
 
4.3 Discussión  
• The present case study resulted in the increase in the company's productivity through the application and development 
of the ABC, EOQ and Slotting tools, which grew from 2.9 to 4.17 representing 43.79%; however, León & Torres, in 
2022, obtained closely similar results with other methodology that were 5S and SLP, managing to increase productivity 
by 40%. 
• According to Rios et. al, 2022, managed to apply the Slotting tool in a food industry warehouse (manufacture of 
cellulose pulp and derivatives) with which they obtained a 19.24% reduction in operating time. With this, it is evident 
that the developed solution sequence suggested in this case can also be applied in other companies from different 
sectors 
• First, regarding limitations and challenges addressed during the research process, it was noticed that there are few 
articles directly applied to the commercial sector of the automotive industry, on the other hand, of those selected, few 
included a software validation which allows to obtain data with greater precision; An example of this is the use of 
Python for demand forecasting. Second, regarding suggestions for future research, it is recommended to include the 
Lean Six Sigma methodology, which is responsible for reducing inventory errors, increasing operational efficiency, 
saving costs and therefore increasing the productivity of the company; To support what is indicated, the authors 
(Adefemi Adeudo, et al., 2023), in their evaluation, observed activities without high added value that led to a low 
efficiency of the process cycle of 40%, after implementation, efficiency improved up to 70%, which established an 
increase in productivity in all warehouse processes. 
5. Conclusiones   
The application of the ABC classification allowed better management and control of inventories by identifying and 
prioritizing products according to their relative importance in terms of value or impact on the business. Through the 
analysis and categorization of products based on their demand, cost and rotation, a clear segmentation was achieved 
that facilitated strategic decision making in inventory management, which led to a better allocation of resources, a 
reduction in storage costs and an optimization of stock levels. 
 
The implementation of the slotting methodology allowed a better organization and distribution of the products in the 
warehouse, ensuring an optimal location of each product based on its rotation and demand. This facilitated order 
fulfillment efficiency and minimized the possibility of errors during the dispatch process. This not only benefited order 
accuracy, but also saved time and resources by minimizing the need for rework and returns. The successful 
implementation of this methodology has proven to be a viable solution to optimize inventory management and ensure 
greater accuracy in product dispatch. As a result, tangible benefits have been obtained in terms of operational 
efficiency. 
 
The EOQ tool made it possible to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs, 
considering storage costs and ordering costs. On the other hand, the Reorder Point established a critical stock threshold 
at which a new order must be placed to avoid stock outs. The simulation carried out in the ARENA program was a 
fundamental part of this study, since it allowed testing and evaluating different scenarios in a controlled environment. 
The simulation gave us the opportunity to adjust the parameters of the EOQ tool and the Reorder Point and observe

their impact on the efficiency of inventories. The results obtained from the simulation confirmed the effectiveness of 
these strategies in reducing stock-outs and improving inventory management significantly.  
• In summary, it is concluded that this study supports the effectiveness of the ABC, EOQ and Slotting strategies in 
increasing productivity in the dispatch area and increasing utility. The successful implementation of these strategies 
has proven to be a viable solution to optimize inventory management, improve efficiency in dispatch processes and 
maximize profits.

Abstract 
Over the years, the Pisco industry has experienced significant growth, which is why the SMEs in the sector need to 
improve their production processes. Many of these companies have difficulties in their production processes related 
to low productivity, mainly due to inefficient plant distribution. Therefore, the main purpose of this scientific article 
is to support these companies in the Pisco industry by increasing their productivity. This will be achieved by 
implementing the following improvement proposal using the engineering tools of Systematic Layout Planning, 5S, 
and Standard Work. The proposal of this article is a new plant layout, in order to eliminate unnecessary transfers in 
the production process, alongside standardized processes and an innovative temperature control system. The proposed 
model was validated with the use of Arena Software by comparing the pre-implementation and post-implementation 
results of the model, in order to verify if the implementation of these tools had a positive impact on the Pisco producing 
company. As a result, the productivity increased by 11%, the transfer times between stages were reduced from 20,36 
hours to 13,86 hours, meaning a 31,92% reduction per production process; and the waste generated during the process 
was reduced by 11%. Also, from a financial point of view, a payback period of 1,51 years and an NPV of USD 3 
938,92 were obtained.

1. Introduction
Pisco production belongs to the agro-industrial manufacturing economic sector in Peru with participation in two 
activities. The first activity is agriculture, due to the inputs required in the production process and the second activity 
is alcoholic beverages, due to the nature of the finished product. The Ministry of Production (2022) states that, at the 
end of 2021, total sales of Pisco amounted to more than 6 million liters, which represented a growth of 53,2% over 
the previous year. Likewise, ADEX (2022), claims that between 2017 and 2021, Peruvian exports of Pisco expanded 
by an annual average of 6,2% and during 2021, Pisco exports accumulated USD 7,2 million, which represented a 
growth of 81,6% over the previous year. In addition, during the first semester of 2022, Pisco exports accumulated 
USD 4,6 million. This is due to the worldwide recognition of the product’s quality. For this reason, distillate consumers 
are in constant search for different flavors and smells, characteristics that can be offered by the different varieties of 
Pisco grapes. Despite this, production methods vary according to the empirical experience of the different producers 
throughout the country. This situation generates products of different qualities and low productivity, a consequence, 
in certain cases, of bad practices in the production process due to lack of knowledge, incorrect plant layout and use of 
inappropriate technology (Mendoza  2015).  
Companies in the manufacturing sector, as is the case of the Pisco industry, have a problem with the management of 
their operations or activities, since only 5% add value to the process. Additionally, there are 35% of activities that do 
not add value and 60% of unnecessary activities (Vargas et al. 2022). Consequently, a model was developed to increase 
productivity and standardize the different stages of the Pisco production process using SLP, Standardization of Work 
and 5S. It should be emphasized that this model is applicable to any Pisco producer SME that seeks improvement in

5. Economic Analysis 
After the proposed model was implemented and the previously described results were calculated, then, proceeded to 
validate the feasibility of the research from an economic approach without considering financial expenses; that is, the 
company assumes the investment by its own capital. In this way, very interesting economic indicators were obtained. 
First, the total investment (USD 8 021) takes into consideration the costs of implementing the 5S tools (USD 911,92), 
SLP (USD 5 147,30) and Standard Work (USD 1 961,96). This investment can be recovered in a period no longer 
than 1,51 years, which is the value of the payback period. In addition, taking into account a 2-year projection, the NPV 
of the project results in USD 3 939. The cash flow presented in the given time horizon, together with the economic 
indicators can be seen in Table 4. Finally, a 40% opportunity cost of capital (COK) was considerate, based on the 
gross margin, investment expectations and valuing the economic effort of the company in making the investment for 
the proposed improvement. With this, the IRR was determined at 53%. It should be noted that a growth factor is 
assumed from the third year after the implementation of the proposed model.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the validation carried out, it was possible to demonstrate that, through the correct implementation of 
engineering tools, it is possible to make improvements in the Peruvian Pisco industry. In the case of this article, it was 
possible to increase the company's productivity by 11%, which translates into a total of 1 452 Pisco bottles of 750ml 
each. Likewise, thanks to the new plant layout, the elimination and reorganization of elements and the new 
standardized processes, carried out with the SLP, 5S and Work Standardization tools, respectively, it was possible to 
reduce transfer times from 20,36 hours to 13,86 hours, which means a reduction of 6,5 hours or 31,92% per production 
process. Likewise, it was possible to reduce waste generated by 11.88% per production process. On the other hand, 
the improvement proposal of this article has the potential to generate a positive economic impact of more than USD 
10 000 per year. Finally, if this proposal is analyzed and implemented by other small and medium-sized companies in 
the Peruvian pisco sector, it could generate growth in the industry, since one of the main problems in the industry is 
an inadequate distribution of the production plant, and with this model, they would be attacking the main problem.

Abstract 
The growth in data trafficking, data processing, e-learning, social networking, digitization of services and in general, 
the simple fact that almost everything is shifting digital, necessitates an ever-increasing demand in information 
handling and processing. The massive amounts of data are stored and processed in “servers,” “routers,” “Firewalls,” 
and storage devices (also known as IT load) installed within data centers (DCs). Data centers consume an important 
amount of electricity (about 2% per year), and it is forecasted that consumption will rise to more than 3.8% of global 
electricity consumption by 2030. Three key elements to be considered are the IT load rating, the layout-arrangement 
of the IT white space and cooling rating. These are related by the power density, which directly relates the data center 
size, the cooling capacity, and energy use. This paper covers the main technical infrastructure design for a case study 
of DC-500 kW in Hoa Lac-Vietnam, the design is following international guidelines and best practices. We present a 
better way for selecting DC’s power density and optimal layout-arrangement for IT racks. It is a conjunction of cooling 
load and airflow sizing, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to analyze the heat distribution (cold air 
intake, hot air exhaust) in DC rack-rows. Airflow analysis is a key consideration during the initial phase of DC sizing 
since it encompasses all the design and configuration elements that go into restricting or preventing mixing between 
the cooling air provided to IT equipment and the hot air rejected from the IT room.

1. Introduction
Data centers (DCs) represent a large and growing energy use sector, and are energy intensive facilities, with 
considerable impact on global power consumption. DCs currently consume about 2% of the global electricity, and 
they are projected to touch 4% by 2030 [Bharany et al.  (2022)]. In Vietnam, with the implementation of the data 
localization law, promoting digital transformation program, and other information services, data center investments 
are increasing in recent years. According to Research and Markets, Vietnam's data center market is predicted to rise 
to more than $1 billion by 2028, up from $561 million in 2022, at a compound yearly growth rate (CAGR) of 10.68%. 
Nowadays, there are over 30 data centers with a capacity of 45 MW, more than 46% located in the north, 35% in the 
south, and 18% in the center. About 80% of data centers are operated by local telecommunications companies such as 
VNPT IDC of the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), Viettel IDC of Viettel Group or FPT

4. Conclusion 
This paper contributes to fill-in the technical research gaps related to data center facility sizing by analyzing the energy 
consumption of data center loads. Two key design parameters for a data center are the IT load rating in kW and the 
physical size of the IT rack equipment in a data hall. To understand from the outset of data center design, three main 
components (i.e., space footprint, power supply, cooling) are the right things to do at the first time, in which a data 
center capacity is specified by an average power density per rack (kW/rack) that allows consideration of the key design 
constraints such as power supplies and thermal requirements. Energy efficiency term by PUE value is also a guideline 
for improving waste due to oversizing design. To analyze the design proposal optimally, CFD airflow analysis was 
performed to estimate the temperature distribution, airflow patterns, pressure, and airflow velocity, as well as evaluate 
the optimum conditions of air distribution for the data center. The results demonstrated the optimal IT rack layout 
placement to meet the operation conditions inside the IT room following ASHRAE thermal guidelines in conjunction 
with giving important recommendations in operation of CRACs with the recommended ""air-setpoint"" level bellow of 
20ºC. This paper has presented a logical approach to documenting data center space and capacity requirements that 
provides sufficient detail for a typical DC in Vietnam to assure that performance is predictable. Even data centers with 
incomplete information and uncertain plans can use this method. To assist users attempting to define a density 
specification, typical design values have been provided.

Abstract 
Safety at work is a very important aspect of a flyover construction project. Flyovers involve working at height and 
with a high risk of falling. Lack of safety factors can cause serious accidents or even death of workers. In an unsafe 
work environment, workers tend to exercise caution and slow down to reduce risk. This can result in a significant 
decrease in work productivity. On the other hand, when safety in the workplace is well cared for, workers will feel 
safe and are motivated to work efficiently, so that productivity increases. The purpose of this study is to analyze the 
work productivity model of the Flyover bridge construction project which is influenced by government policies related 
to construction safety on the work productivity of the Flyover construction project. Surveys have been conducted on 
several bridge construction projects in Palembang City, South Sumatra Province, INDONESIA. The number of 
respondents in this study was 35 respondents. Data collection techniques were carried out through distributing 
questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The results showed that construction safety consisted of indicators of physical 
health, mental health, emotions, preventive efforts, and curative efforts. These five indicators can minimize the risk 
of accidents or occupational diseases. Workers can complete their work on time with minimal work accidents, meaning 
that construction safety can affect work productivity. Government policies in the form of laws, government 
regulations, ministerial regulations, ministerial decrees, and director general decisions can be used as guidelines or 
references by companies in protecting worker safety so as not to hamper productivity at work.

1. Introduction
Construction projects are a series of implementation processes that have certain time, goals, and resources, ranging 
from planning, implementation, and post-construction maintenance activities, the series of activities there is a process 
that processes project resources into a type of building/construction. These resources have been arranged in a project 
organization to complete based on time, cost, and quality in accordance with specifications and predetermined quality 
standards (Cheung et al. 2004). Low productivity is often caused by a lack of good planning before starting a project. 
If there is no adequate planning, there may be delays, discrepancies in resource allocation, or shortages of necessary 
materials (Lessing et al. 2017).

1. The coefficient of the construction safety variable is 0.451 if the value of other variables in the state is fixed 
and there is an increase of 1 point in the construction safety variable, work productivity will increase by 0.451 
points. 
2. The coefficient of government policy variables is 0.426 if the value of other variables in the state is fixed and 
there is an increase of 1 point in the government policy variable, work productivity will increase by 0.426 
points. 
Based on the output results in table 6, known hypothesis testing (Boostrapping) for structural equations is shown as 
follows: : 
1. The effect of construction safety on work productivity 
The t-statistic value for the effect of construction safety on work productivity of the original sample value of 
0.451 is positive and t is calculated at 3.174> t-table (1.960) and p-value is 0.004  < 0.05 and the original 
value of the sample is positive. Thus, the hypothesis in this study is accepted. That is, there is a positive and 
significant influence between construction safety and work productivity. 
2. The effect of government policies on work productivity 
The t-statistic value for the effect of government policies on work productivity is 0.426 positive and t-
calculated is 3.069> t-table (1.960) and the p-value is 0.004 < 0.05 and the original sample value is positive. 
Thus, the hypothesis in this study is accepted. That is, there is a positive and significant influence between 
government policies on work productivity. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research that has been done, it can be seen that construction safety consists of indicators of 
physical health, mental health, emotions, preventive efforts, and curative efforts. These five indicators can minimize 
the risk of accidents or occupational diseases. With the lack of work accidents, workers can complete their work on 
time, meaning that construction safety can affect work productivity. Based on the results of research on the Sekip 
Ujung Palembang Flyover Development Project, it is known that there is a positive and significant influence between 
government policies on work productivity. Government policies in the form of laws, government regulations, 
ministerial regulations, ministerial decrees, and director-general decrees can be used as guidelines or references by 
companies in protecting worker safety so as not to hamper productivity at work.

756","11. Conclusion 
Brewery spent grains (BSG) can be value added to bio coal pellets. The percentage 
conversion of brewery spent grains to bio coal at 250-300 ᵒC and 25 bars was 65.7%. The 
characterization results of the bio coal showed that its calorific value and fixed carbon is 
higher than that of fossil coal. The fixed carbon gives an estimation of the heating value. 
A HAZOP analysis was carried out, process control was done to eliminate the hazards. The 
Environmental Impact Assessment showed that bio coal production has negligible negative 
impacts on the environment. The total capital investment needed to start the bio coal plant 
is USD 7.6 million with 4.6 years as payback period and a 21.7% return on investment. 
The net present value was positive indicating the economic viability of producing bio coal 
pellets from BSG. The study company will save approximately USD1.4 million per annum 
that was being used to purchase fossil coal and the environmental costs associated with 
waste disposal.

Abstract 
Based on the internal database as big data of X-Bank, 3,527 active customers with an initial length of service of 
more than 12 months, the method of data mining is concerned with the mathematic methods of K-Means of the 
cluster, Tree Decision, and Association Analysis are applied in the study. The findings show that with eight main 
products, such as VG (Visa Gold), VC (Visa Classis), MG (Master Gold), MS (Master Standard), VP (Visa 
Platinum), VV (Viva Violet Card), VA (Visa Auto Card), and others, VG and VC are the two top cards, in that the 
high-income customers, e.g. directors are more interested in VG card, while staffs concern VC card. In addition, 
using two cards, called the main card and the extra card, is popular. This is a potential chance for the bank to 
develop cross-selling products, which the product bundle strategies are packed into groups.

Abstract 
This article aims to conduct empirical research on the relationship between determinants of citizen relationship quality 
and e-Government adoption. Using primary data from a cross-sectional field survey, 11 cities, towns, and districts in 
Tien Giang Province, Vietnam were analyzed. Statistical descriptive analysis was performed on the responses received 
from 529 respondents by using SmartPLS4 to evaluate the measurement and structural models. This research 
investigated four attributes such as perceived accountability, security, responsiveness, and transparency are some of 
the features studied along with their respective influences on the quality of relationships with citizens, which are 
drivers of e-Government adoption. Evidence from this study shows that when people have positive impressions of 
their government regarding security, responsiveness, and transparency, they are more likely to trust and satisfy their 
government and use e-Government services. However, there is no correlation between citizens' sense of responsibility 
and the quality of their interpersonal relationships. Additionally, there is a favorable correlation between relationship 
quality and the use of e-Government. The results provide new insight into the relationship between trust and 
satisfaction and the likelihood of using e-Government services. This research contributes to our understanding of what 
makes relationships flourish by delving into the dynamics between four factors: responsibility, security, 
responsiveness, and transparency. The findings aid practitioners like government agencies in better-comprehending 
e-service delivery, which in turn promotes more widespread use of e-Government.

Introduction 
Beginning in the early 1990s, e-Government initiatives were launched worldwide. Compared to more traditional 
means, e-Government can significantly save expenses while increasing the quality of service provided to citizens. The 
subject of how governments might boost citizen adoption and utilization of their online government services arises in 
light of the increased interest in e-Government. In addition, e-Government was associated favorably with raising 
public confidence in government transparency and accountability (Ahn and Bretschneider 2011), improving 
transparency to reduce corruption (Park and Blenkinsopp 2011). E-Government services aim to improve the quality 
of relationships between the government and its citizens and the use of e-Government improves the perception of 
government openness, efficiency, accessibility, and responsiveness among the general public (Tolbert and Mossberger

Abstract 
The one-dimensional cutting stock problem is a fundamental problem in manufacturing that involves the preparation 
of raw materials for production. An example of a cutting stock problem in the industry is steel pipe manufacturing, 
where the raw material preparation operation requires cutting steel sheets from stock rolls based on job specifications. 
Steel manufacturers usually perform job planning and scheduling on the cutting process to satisfy the production 
requirement, i.e. job due date, from subsequent operation. The key performance measure is job tardiness. In this paper, 
we propose a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the one-dimensional cutting stock problem so as to 
minimize total job tardiness. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in 
performing job scheduling to meet the due dates. 
Keywords 
One-dimensional cutting stock problem, Mixed integer linear programming, Due dates, and Job tardiness. 
1. Introduction
The steel pipe manufacturing industry is a major industry in Thailand. Pipe products are in different shapes, sizes, 
lengths, and thicknesses. They are produced by a two-stage manufacturing process. In the first stage known as coil-
cutting, a steel coil with a thickness is cut into coils with smaller widths. After that, these small coils are fed to a 
machine to produce steel pipes in the second stage. This stage is referred to as pipe-forming. To cope with the 
increasing demand for steel pipes in terms of the number of orders and variety of pipes in each order, manufacturers 
are trying to maximize the efficiency of their production process by synchronizing the coil-cutting and pipe-forming 
stages. The synchronization is achieved by generating a cutting plan such that coils with the right widths and

respectively. According to the solution, there are six jobs that are tardy, and the total tardiness of all jobs is 169 
minutes. The specific jobs that are tardy and their corresponding tardiness values are shown in the figure. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Job tardiness 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for the coil-cutting production stage. 
The model is a variant of one-dimensional CSP, which aims at minimizing total job tardiness. The effectiveness of 
our proposed model is demonstrated by a numerical experiment. The results indicate that our model can generate a 
cutting plan with minimal tardiness. This implies an opportunity to further extend this model. For instance, our model 
can be integrated with the scheduling model for pipe-forming production stage to be a unified planning model for steel 
pipe production industries. Another possible extension of our proposed model is to develop algorithms that generate 
cutting plans for large problem instances, involving dozens or hundreds of steel pipe orders.

increasingly strengthened by the demands of 21st-century learning and sustainable development goals, in a 
multidisciplinary context. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is a multidisciplinary 
approach that is integrated with technology, which is used as an alternative for achieving the institutional vision of a 
state Islamic university to support graduate learning outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a strategy to 
strengthen the institutional vision that develops Islamic scholarship, science, and technology in an integrated manner. 
The purpose of this research is to provide recommendation strategies to policymakers for improving the quality of 
Islamic Education in Indonesia. The Strategic Assumption Surface and Testing (SAST) method were adopted in this 
study through focus group discussions and interviews with selected experts, which included 2 experts and 8 educators. 
The results of the assumptions are grouped according to the level of importance and certainty in the quadrant graph. 
This study found that there were 25 strategic assumptions that were formulated to increase the achievement of 
integrated learning outcomes with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). The results of the SAST 
method classify strategic assumptions into 4 quadrants. There are 15 items that assume the strategy is at a high level 
of importance and certainty in quadrant 1 and are a priority for implementation. This research has limitations in 
determining the priority of assumptions to be applied. Further research is recommended to carry out weighing and 
ranking in selecting the best strategic assumptions by policymakers.

5. Conclusion 
The application of the Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST) method in this research has successfully 
categorized pertinent strategic assumptions aimed at enhancing strategies for reinforcing the integration of Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in Islamic education. A total of 25 strategic assumptions have 
been delineated, distributed across quadrant 1, as per this method. Consequently, decision-makers can consider these 
strategies for augmenting the integration of STEM in Islamic education based on the importance and certainty levels 
associated with each assumption. 
Furthermore, this study has identified nine key strategic assumptions. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that 
this research faces limitations in determining the prioritization of these assumptions. Therefore, it is recommended 
that future research incorporates weighting and ranking mechanisms to select the most suitable strategic assumptions 
for proposing to policymakers. These efforts aim to enhance strategies for strengthening the integration of Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in Islamic education at the Islamic University of Riau Province.

Abstract 
During the design process of new products, it would be important to obtain the impact of design decisions in terms of 
their cost effects. In this way, a rough product cost calculation could be obtained in order to decide whether such a 
product is worth manufacturing or not. Often, companies have an upper limit for manufacturing costs back-calculated 
from the expected market price, which is to be adhered to in the product design. A large amount of these costs are 
caused by the used material costs. But how should material costs be estimated if new components that have not been 
used before are to be handled? Obtaining offers for only planned, potentially eligible components on the procurement 
market is certainly out of the question for reasons of expense and time. Especially since alternative components with 
the same or similar technical properties often exist and the designer has to choose one of them. In order to solve this 
problem, we investigated whether a good cost estimate or forecast can be realized with the help of intelligent methods. 
An innovative two-stage technique with Clustering and Neural Nets showed the best results. The basis for this 
approach is a large data collection of previously supplied components with their specifications and their procurement 
prices.

1. Introduction
Designing new products is a strategic issue for enterprises. A new product should not only attract potential customers 
and meet customers' demands but also be profitable. However, a significant problem in many industries is that it is 
very difficult to estimate the profit of a new product with sufficient accuracy at an early stage of its design. This is 
due on the one hand to the uncertainty regarding the market price that can be realized at a later date and on the other 
hand to the uncertainty regarding the expected manufacturing costs. However, while the market price can be 
determined to a large extent by the customer or is predetermined by the market situation, the problem with 
manufacturing costs is that a large part of the costs is determined after the product specification, but during the design 
process, which determines the specification, the costs are not known or only insufficiently known. 
Therefore, it would be very helpful for the product specification to get such cost data to control these decisions. In 
particular, it would be valuable and desirable for product engineers to get cost data as early as possible. If component 
cost data are already provided during the design phase he could use the information for designing decisions and 
consider its effect on the total manufacturing costs of the final product. This allows the customer to select from the 
technically available alternatives the one that can be procured at the most favorable price in the future (Brinke et al. 
2000). During the design process decisions must be made about the (planned) use of components that have not yet

decisions exceed this amount, they must be revised to conform with the plan. In this regard, these cost effects must be 
made explicit early on. This is the only way to steer the ship in the proper direction early on and avoid costly bad 
investments. 
 
4.2 Future Research 
This study lays the foundation for future research into the potential of machine learning to improve engineering design 
decisions in the early stages of product development. From a technical standpoint, future research on applied machine 
learning should examine not only the price level but also the price deviation of the component price. Predicting the 
price deviation could be accomplished by the same method as predicting the average price, with the added advantage 
of obtaining a range of probable price data, which is a valuable indicator of procurement price risk. In addition, 
additional research might be conducted on the benefits of utilizing additional market data (i.e., procurement market 
characteristics, supplier data) to improve the estimates' precision. From a decision science and business intelligence 
perspective, it is promising that machine learning techniques can be used in supply chain operations to create 
awareness regarding uncertainties in the product price.

Abstract 
The present study aims to examine the influence of corporate governance on capital structure decisions within the 
Indonesian banking sector. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 264 firm-year observations from 24 banks 
that were publicly traded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange throughout the period spanning from 2011 to 2021. The 
data are analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics and the Generalized Method of Moments, specifically employing the 
dynamic panel model. The findings of this study indicate that the level of management ownership and the inclusion 
of foreign directors on a company's board of directors exert influence on leverage ratios. Specifically, the first variable 
has a positive effect, while the second variable demonstrates a negative effect. This study contributes to the existing 
literature on capital structure and corporate governance by presenting novel insights into the impact of both factors on 
capital structure within the financial industry. The aforementioned findings will aid policymakers in evaluating the 
adequacy of corporate governance changes in bolstering the management of capital structure, particularly within the 
context of Indonesia. The results demonstrate that management ownership and the presence of foreign directors on a 
company's board of directors have an impact on leverage ratios, with a positive effect for the first variable and a 
negative one for the second. This study adds to the body of knowledge on capital structure and corporate governance 
by providing fresh information on how these factors affect capital structure in the financial industry. These findings 
will help policymakers assess whether corporate governance reforms are sufficient to enhance capital structure 
management, especially in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Conflicts pertaining to agency emerge due to the separation of ownership and control within an organization. 
According to Jensen and Meckling (1976), in the context of an agency relationship, the agent, who assumes the role 
of a manager, may exhibit a tendency to put their personal interests over those of the principal. The magnitude of 
resources under managerial control is a determinant factor in the impact of agency costs on the composition of capital 
structures. Jensen (1986) posits that managers may opt to acquire debt as a means of augmenting their control over 
resources, a decision that can potentially result in agency costs, including the possibility of bankruptcy expenses. In 
this context, corporate governance serves as the principal mechanism for fostering the congruence of interests between 
principals and agents. 
Corporate governance encompasses the range of rules, procedures, and interpersonal relationships that regulate a 
business. It is widely recognized that shareholders, who possess ownership stakes in companies, typically strive to 
maximize their returns on investment. Nevertheless, it is common for stakeholders in conventional organizations to 
have varying levels of knowledge and ethical concerns, resulting in asymmetrical connections. Corporate governance 
is frequently regarded as a mechanism employed to ensure that firms act in the optimal interests of their shareholders. 
According to Miglo (2016), the term ""government"" pertains to a comprehensive framework of guidelines, regulations, 
832","Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

In order to mitigate information asymmetry and maximize profitability, the principal may opt to appoint a senior 
manager (director) as their representative within the organization. The results align with the findings of Yousef et al. 
(2020), wherein it was observed that the presence of foreign directors exerts a notable and adverse impact on the 
capital structure. 
 
The empirical analysis of management ownership yielded noteworthy positive outcomes in relation to capital 
structure, which aligns with the formulated hypothesis (H6). According to the hypothesis proposed by Jensen and 
Meckling (1976), a common occurrence in principal-agent relationships is the presence of information asymmetry, 
which arises from disparities in knowledge between the two parties involved. Investors exhibit a preference for agents 
due to the perceived possession of extensive and thorough knowledge pertaining to the company. Incorporating 
pertinent details in the provision of financing recommendations that may yield advantages for investors. One potential 
approach to addressing the issue of information asymmetry is the implementation of management share offerings 
within a corporation. The Principal expressed a need for the agents' assistance in disseminating information to 
investors in a more equitable manner. The company's profitability continues to be at an excellent level. The results of 
this study align with the findings of Feng et al. (2020) and Thakolwiroj and Sithipolvanichgul (2021), which 
demonstrate a favorable correlation between managerial ownership and capital structure. 
 
Contrary to the formulated hypotheses (H1, H2, H3, and H5), this study did not find any significant influence on the 
size of management, the number of management meetings, the number of risk committees, or institutional ownership. 
This finding aligns with previous research undertaken by Vijayakumaran and Vijayacumaran (2019) as well as Al-
Saidi (2020), which suggests that the size of the management team does not have a major impact on the capital 
structure. According to the studies conducted by Al-Saidi (2020) and Grabinska et al. (2021), it was determined that 
institutional ownership did not exhibit a statistically significant impact on capital structure. However, the findings of 
the study conducted by Shehadeh et al. present a contradictory perspective. According to the findings of Ezeani et al. 
(2022), it was demonstrated that the frequency of board meetings exhibited a statistically significant and favorable 
impact on the capital structure. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Further research and analysis are required to gain a deeper understanding of the correlation between corporate 
governance variables and capital structure decisions. It is necessary to investigate the potential impact of various 
contextual elements that may contribute to divergent outcomes. For instance, future investigations may prioritize the 
identification of other forms of corporate governance that have not been considered as variables in the present study. 
There exists a necessity to do research that precisely establishes a connection between banking regulation and 
corporate governance mechanisms. The inclusion of macroeconomic information as a determinant in bank capital 
structure decisions was also proposed by the researchers. The authors of the report propose a further examination of 
the method employed to assess leverage in the banking sector, specifically recommending a reevaluation that 
distinguishes between short-term and long-term debt. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The present study focuses on the governance of Indonesian banking organizations, specifically examining the impact 
of foreign directors' composition on the capital structure. The presence of foreign management exerts a detrimental 
impact on the business capital structure. The results align with the pecking order theory, which posits that firms with 
a higher proportion of foreign directors are inclined to augment their corporate finance by means of heightened equity 
or share issuance. The presence of managerial ownership exerts a favorable and statistically significant impact on the 
composition of a firm's capital structure. According to Jensen and Meckling (1976), the agency theory posits that the 
possession of management shares might serve as a mechanism to mitigate the knowledge imbalance that exists 
between the principal and agent. Prior studies have also provided evidence in favor of a positive correlation between 
managerial ownership and capital structure. In contrast to our initial premise, the variables of management size, 
number of management meetings, and size of risk committees do not exhibit a statistically significant impact on the 
capital structure. The aforementioned findings will aid policymakers in evaluating the adequacy of corporate 
governance changes in bolstering the management of capital structure, particularly within the context of Indonesia.

Abstract 
This study examines the influence of capital structure, profitability, and dividend payout on the firm value of banking 
subsector firms. The focus of this study is the bank subsector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
between 2013 and 2021. The sample for this study consists of banks listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) 
between 2013 and 2021. Purposive sampling was used to select these institutions for sampling based on their 
compliance with the research requirements. The population as a whole consists of 34 businesses, while the subset of 
enterprises meeting the specified criteria consists of 8 samples with a research duration of 9 years, yielding a total of 
72 data observations. The panel regression technique reveals that the capital structure has no statistically significant 
effect on the value of a company. Nevertheless, return on assets has a strong positive correlation with firm value. In 
contrast, earnings per share have a negative relationship with firm value. Furthermore, dividend payments have no 
statistically significant effect on the value of a company. This paper provides new empirical evidence regarding the 
influence of capital structure, profitability, and dividend distribution on the Indonesian banking sector.

1. Introduction
The Indonesian Government has outlined its objectives for the country's economic growth in the National Medium-
Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020–2024. The plan intends to achieve a targeted economic growth rate ranging 
from 5.7% to 6%. Additionally, the financial services sector is expected to contribute to the Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) within a range of 6.2% to 7.2%. In Indonesia, the banking industry holds a significant majority in the realm of 
financial services, comprising approximately 90% of the market. This statement underscores the strategic significance 
of banks in facilitating and bolstering a nation's economic expansion. The strategic function of banks encompasses the 
crucial task of facilitating the flow of capital from fund owners to entities requiring funds. This intermediary role plays 
a significant part in fostering the growth of sectors that possess the potential to drive economic expansion, while also 
enabling the establishment of fresh economic avenues. The assessment of a bank's corporate value serves as an 
indicator of its effectiveness in attaining its objectives and optimizing its function within the financial industry. 
As widely acknowledged through diverse sources, the primary objective of a corporation is to optimize its financial 
gains, including through the utilization of banking services. Damodaran (2016) posits that the primary objective of a 
corporation is to optimize its value, and its financial theory is formulated and advanced in alignment with this 
objective. According to prevailing corporate financial theory, the primary objective of decision-making is to optimize 
the value of a firm or enterprise. Hence, the attainment of the highest possible value of the organization can be realized 
by means of the incorporation of financial management tasks. The core duties of financial management encompass 
the determination of investment decisions, capital structures, and dividend policies. Hence, choices pertaining to 
investments, capital structure, or dividends that enhance the overall worth of a corporation are seen as favorable, but 
actions that diminish its value are deemed unfavorable.

larger pool of samples for analysis. By incorporating macroeconomic variables, it is anticipated that a more 
comprehensive framework will be established to guide investors in their investment decision-making process, as they 
get insights into favorable macroeconomic indicators. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the findings of the analysis, it can be concluded that: (1) the impact of capital structure on firm value is not 
statistically significant; (2a) profitability, as measured by the return on assets (ROA), has a statistically significant 
positive relationship with firm value; (2b) profitability, as measured by earnings per share (EPS), has a statistically 
significant negative relationship with firm value; and (3) dividend payments do not have a statistically significant 
impact on firm value.

Abstract 
The Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem (HHCRSP) has become one of the major consideration for 
many Home Health Care (HHC) service providers who deliver home and personal care services directly to customers' 
homes. Satisfying customers' needs and caregivers' well-being requires and saving a comprehensive approach that 
balances the quality of care provided to patients with the well-being and job satisfaction of caregivers. 
This study has developed a mixed-integer programming model with the aim of minimizing travel distances while 
simultaneously achieving a balanced workload, meeting clients' requirements, and accommodating caregivers' lunch 
breaks. For small-scale problems, this study employed CPLEX software to solve to find the optimal solutions. For 
large-scale problems, these problems were divided into smaller problems by using (Agglomerative Hierarchical 
Clustering) AHC and K-meaning Algorithms. The obtained results indicate that the combination of the AHC algorithm 
and CPLEX yields superior solutions compared to the utilization of the K-means algorithm and CPLEX via testing 
randomly generated datasets. The proposed approach is put to the test in a real-world case study conducted in Ho Chi 
Minh City.

1. Introduction
One of the fastest-growing sectors of the health care industry today, which is Home Health Care (HHC) service is 
studied. First of all, HHC is the delivery of social, medical and paramedical services to clients directly to their own 
home following their request. Every day, caregivers from a HHC center start their route at the center, receiving the 
list of the clients they need to service, visit them to provide the services and then return to the center. There are many

except for the parameters being examined. It was hard to test the whole data set of 156 clients, so a small data set of 
25 clients and 6 caregivers (4 for homecare services and 2 for personal care services) were picked up to do the 
sensitivity analysis. The table and figure below are the comparison between the solution of 4 scenarios and the original 
ones for further conclusions.  
Scenario 1: Decrease the lunch break time window [bb, ab] of a caregiver from [11.5, 13.0] to [12.0, 13.0] 
Scenario 2: Decrease the client’s time window [𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖] from 30 mins to 15 mins only. 
Scenario 3: Increase the client’s time window [𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖] from 30 mins to 45 mins. 
Scenario 4: Increase the client’s time window [𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖] from 30 mins to 45 mins as well as Shorten the lunch break 
time window of a caregiver [bb, ab] from [11.5, 13.0] to [12.0, 13.0]. 
 
 
Figure 6. Comparison between 4 scenario and original case 
From the result above, we can see that scenario 3 had a good impact on the objective, especially when it caused the 
cost paid for daily wage of all caregivers to drop to almost 10%. The more flexible the time window, the more decrease 
in final solution. On the other hand, scenarios 1 and 2 make the objective increase compared with the origin while 
scenario 4 did not show much effect on the final results. It can be seen that when I consider the hard time window for 
client (only 15 mins) in scenario 2, the model required more caregivers to ensure all clients are being served without 
violating their time windows and skills’ requirement. However, in order to afford this case, not only did the travel cost 
increase 8.87% but also the total caregivers’ daily wage increased to nearly 14%, resulting in the 13.74% increase in 
the final objective.  
Therefore, for further recommendation for the improvement, in the case the company wants to decrease the total travel 
distance and total cost, they should consider the flexible time window to reduce the number of caregivers required. 
However, in practice, it seems unreasonable since no clients are willing to wait or accept more than 30 mins late. This 
case somehow decreases the clients’ satisfaction. On the contrary, if the company wants to improve customers’ 
satisfaction, they change into the hard time window (no more than 15 mins) rather than flexible time window like the 
original case. Obviously, it will make their cost increase significantly since more caregivers will be required. 
7. Conclusion  
This study introduces a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model aimed at resolving the Home Health Care 
Routing and Scheduling Problem for Newborns and Mothers, while accounting for caregivers' lunch breaks. The 
primary objective of this model is to minimize overall cost. The resulting optimal solutions take into account 
constraints time windows and client requirements. To validate performance of the proposed approach, a real-world 
dataset consisting of 156 clients from an HHC provider in Ho Chi Minh City, offering home and personal care services 
for newborns and mothers, was utilized. To further enhance the model's applicability, two clustering algorithms, 
namely Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and K-Means, were employed to divide the data into smaller 
clusters based on distance. Routings for these clusters are optimized by CLEX. Following the optimal results, AHC 
emerged as the more effective approach. This methodology can be implemented in various settings where similar 
routing and scheduling challenges exist. 
 
For future research, it is recommended to extend the proposed model to address scenarios involving unexpected delays 
in caregivers' travel or situations where clients might need to add more service during service time.

Abstract 
Pharmaceutical industry is instrumental to the well-being of people around the world as it deals with the discovery, 
development, production and marketing of drugs and medications, which are one of life’s necessities. Recently, there 
is an emerging phenomenon that some hospitals in Vietnam must suppress their operation due to the deficiency of 
medical supply, and thus affecting patients who are in the need for treatment. One of the factors contributing to the 
situation is the incapability of providing these commodities on time from pharmaceutical companies, which results 
from their inaccurate forecasting. This paper investigates the application of machine learning algorithms in time series 
forecasting, specifically focusing on Support Vector Regression (SVR) to improve forecast accuracy. It evaluates the 
performance of two time series models, including ARIMA and Holt’s Trend, and three types of SVR, including Linear 
kernel, Polynomial kernel, and Radial Basic Function (RBF). The evaluation is based on the Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error (MAPE) metric, which measures the accuracy of the forecasts. The study then proposes hybrid 
models that combine SVR with traditional time series models via ensemble methods and compares their performance 
with the individual models. Finally, a case study of a pharmaceutical company is performed to assess the impacts of 
these methods. The results demonstrate that the hybrid ensemble method achieves lower MAPE values compared to 
the individual models. These findings offer promising insights and highlight the potential of the proposed hybrid 
models in improving forecast accuracy.

The provided table reaffirms that selecting the appropriate stopping criterion in EMD can indeed enhance forecast 
accuracy within the homogeneous approach. This is evidenced by the significant improvement in Plavix 75's MAPE 
achieved through the right choice. Furthermore, the homogeneous ensemble's remarkable outcome validates the initial 
hypothesis that this method outperforms individual approaches by capitalizing on diverse forecasting strengths and 
data characteristics. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper aimed to address the forecasting challenges in the pharmaceutical industry by exploring and evaluating 
various forecasting methods. Through a comprehensive analysis of individual forecasting methods and the 
development of a ensemble approach, valuable insights and improvements in forecast accuracy have been achieved. 
The analysis of individual forecasting methods highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate methods based on 
the characteristics of the data and the underlying patterns. The findings emphasized the need to consider factors such 
as linearity, trend, and non-linear patterns when choosing the most effective forecasting method for each product. 
 
The homogeneous ensemble approach, specifically by adjusting the stopping boundaries for the Empirical Mode 
Decomposition process and aligning it with the specific characteristics of the data, the homogeneous ensemble 
achieved the most optimal MAPE. This underscores the significance of adjusting the stopping boundaries 
appropriately to extract relevant linear and non-linear patterns for improved forecasting accuracy. 
 
In summary, this paper contributes to advancing forecasting practices in the pharmaceutical industry by providing 
valuable insights and practical frameworks for enhancing forecast accuracy. The findings have important implications 
for decision-making and strategic planning in the pharmaceutical sector, enabling more informed and accurate demand 
forecasting. 
 
It is important to acknowledge that forecasting is an ongoing process, and there is always room for further refinement 
and improvement. As a recommendation, it is crucial for future research to address the limitations posed by the limited 
availability of data for model training in this study. The dataset used here covers a short period, which may restrict 
the models' ability to capture long-term trends and account for unforeseen patterns that could emerge in the future. To 
enhance the forecasting models' accuracy and generalizability, researchers should aim to collect more extensive and 
diverse datasets. Including data from a broader timeframe and covering a wider range of scenarios and market 
conditions can improve the models' robustness and applicability. Moreover, incorporating data from different 
geographical regions or market segments can help address potential biases and further validate the models' 
effectiveness in various contexts. Furthermore, it is essential to explore and integrate additional data sources that may 
provide valuable insights into the pharmaceutical industry's demand dynamics. This could include external factors 
such as macroeconomic indicators, regulatory changes, public health events, and other relevant variables that influence 
drug demand. Leveraging such data can enrich the forecasting models and enable them to adapt to dynamic and 
evolving market conditions. Moreover, the use of advanced machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence 
algorithms should be considered in future research. These approaches have the potential to extract more complex 
patterns and relationships from the data, leading to more accurate and robust forecasting models.

Abstract 
In the Dual-Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop Problem (DRCFJSP), two different types of resources, such as 
workers and machines, are required to process each job's operations. The analysis and assessment of priority decision 
rules for scheduling production jobs in DRCFJSPs is the primary goal of this work. The evaluation criteria in this 
research consists of demand, due date, cycle time, number of operations, and setup time. Then, a set of priority rules 
for development is chosen after a review of the literature, including Composite Dispatching Rules (CDRs) and Multi-
Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)-based priority rules like Preference Selection Index (PSI), and Proximity Index 
Value (PIV). The weights of criteria are obtained by fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (Fuzzy 
SWARA). Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model is developed to assess the performance of the DRCFJSPs with 
different rules. Numerical examples and real-world problems (with 114 jobs, 28 machines, and 23 people) are used to 
determine the best-performing prioritization rule. For all cases, the CDR considering Processing Time, Least Work 
Remaining, Earliest Due Date were found to be the best. The PSI-based rule is in second rank for large-scale case. 
Overall, the suggested approach yields solid results and is easy to adapt to real-world scenarios.

1. Introduction
The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is one of the most important multimodal optimization issues, a 
well-known standard abstraction of the real production process. Routing and scheduling are the two subproblems that 
make up the FJSP (Soofi et al. 2021). The assigned processes must be sequenced across all machines in order to 
generate a workable schedule with a tolerable goal value. The routing sub-problem entails allocating each operation 
to one of a group of given machines. However, in practice, tasks cannot be completed if employees are not present or 
do not possess the necessary skills. The worker-resources constraint must be taken into consideration to get around 
this problem. Thus, the dual-resource limited flexible job shop scheduling problem—an expanded FJSP that considers 
the worker resources constraint—is suggested. Determining the operation order and allocating the resources, including 
employees and machinery, are necessary to solve the Dual-Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop Scheduling 
(DRCFJSP). 
In manufacturing, the presence of skilled operators is crucial for task completion. Processing times depend on operator 
efficiency and specialization, impacting the overall job shop schedule. Different operators using the same machine 
exhibit varied skills and speeds. Operator proficiency often corresponds to experience and specialization. This 
variation can lead to tasks being completed at different rates. In general, each job can only be handled by the 
appropriate equipment and operator for the assembly process to be successful. This implies that each job needs two

The outcomes of the real-world problem reveal that most CDRs in Table 8 outperform the MCDM-based priority rules 
for every performance metric. Overall, the CDR R1: 2PT + LWKR + EDD rule is the one that performs the best, 
according to the average performance measure of all objectives. And between two MCDM-based rules, R3: PSI has 
shown to be a better rule.

Overall, it is evident that in both small-scale and real-world situations, the effectiveness of CDRs, especially R1: 2PT 
+ LWKR + EDD, surpassed that of MCDMs. This discrepancy in performance, as indicated by the average measure 
across all objectives, could be attributed to the inherent feature of preprogrammed job prioritization within CDRs, a 
characteristic absent in MCDMs. The CDR approach dynamically recalculates job priority whenever modifications 
occur in the criteria data during simulation, in contrast to the MCDM-based rules which establish job ranking solely 
during the initial phase without subsequent updates. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this research, hybrid MCDM-based priority rules were created as an innovative solution to the DRCFJSP. The 
MCDM approaches are used with a Fuzzy SWARA method to calculate criteria’s weights. Job prioritizing was 
accomplished using two MCDM techniques, i.e., PSI, and PIV. A DES model is also built to assess the DRCFJSPs' 
efficiency metrics.  
 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the CDRs and MCDM-based priority rules, we used numerical instances of small 
scale and a case study of large scale. For all cases, the CDR considering processing time, Least Work Remaining, 
Earliest Due Date (R1) were found mostly outperforming the MCDM-based priority rules for almost every 
performance metric. The PSI-based rule is in second rank after the R1 for large-scale case. However, the MCDM-
based rules offer the flexibility to change the ranking criteria and the optimal weights depending on the expert's 
knowledge. The performance of the shop floor may be enhanced by using MCDM-based priority rules for complex 
issues involving numerous factors, such as demand, due date, setup time, cycle time, and the number of operations. 
The suggested technique is straightforward and user-friendly in practical settings. The research's drawback, however, 
is that for the MCDM method, it fails to automatically update the new criteria information once each operation is 
completed, which prevents the simulation from automatically updating the new job rating. This can be solved by 
integrating VBA coding in Arena, which will be addressed in our future work.

Abstract 
In manufacturing system, a developed form of Flow Shop known as a Hybrid Flow shop System (HFS) allows the 
simultaneous operation of many identical machines on each stage. Duplicators are used to scale up a factory, increase 
output, balance a production line, or reduce the impact of a bottleneck. Several industries, including automotive, 
accessories and electronics, make extensive use of HFS. This study addresses the scheduling among machines in the 
HFS by applying the Discrete event simulation (DES) modeling in conjunction with priority rules based on Multi-
Criteria Decision Making (MCDMs) and Composite Dispatching Rules (CDRs). The model aims to reduce the 
Makespan, mean Flowtime, mean Tardiness, and maximum Tardiness considering multi criteria namely Cycle time, 
Set-up time, Due date, Order and Number of Operations. The suggested solution framework combines MCDM 
approaches, such as the technique for prioritize order by VIekriteri-jumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR), 
separately to prioritize the jobs, and with Criteria Importance Through Inter-Criteria Correlation (CRITIC) for 
allocating weights to the criteria.

1. Introduction
In a flow-shop manufacturing process, jobs follow a fixed linear structure. Hybrid flow-shop (HFS) is one common 
type of flow-shop in which there are duplicating machines per stage. Duplicators are used to scale up a factory, increase 
output, balance a production line, or reduce the impact of a bottleneck. Several industries, including automotive, 
accessories and electronics, make extensive use of HFS. Scheduling problem becomes challenging when taking into 
account the complexity of production systems with multiple machines and the possibility of machine breakdowns, 
leading to increased makespan and tardiness, and decreased throughput. In order to improve the operation efficiency, 
research literature has suggested various approaches, from sophisticated scheduling algorithms, heuristic techniques, 
multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models, to simulation. Exploration of different combinations of these 
methods promise unlimitted opportunities to maximize the shop performance. 
1.1 Objectives  
In this study, we will explore the combination of the Composite Dispatching Rules, MCDM method and simulation 
to prioritize jobs in an HFS in order to reduce Makespan, mean flow time, mean Tardiness, and maximum 
Tardiness. 
While some studies have investigated the use of simulation and MCDM in scheduling for flow shop production with 
breakdown machines, there is still a need for more research in this area. For instance, the application of these methods 
in different industries, such as automotive or electronics, has not been explored extensively. Application of different 
CDRs and MCDM methods may have different results in different contexts. Our work follows the framework of

4.2. The Best Performing Rule in Real-World Case 
The real case results show that for practically every performance indicator, the CDRs outperform the MCDM-based 
priority rules. For the objective of minimizing makespan, the CDR and VIKOR are equivalent. The CDR also 
performs best considering the average performance measure of all objectives.

That the CDR surpasses the MCDM rule can be explained by looking into the way these rules are integrated into the 
simulation. The CDR is coded with VBA embeded in ARENA, which enables its criteria of due date, remaining 
number of operations, total work content, remaining work content and number of operations updated each time a 
part visiting a machine. On the other hand, the ranking by MCDM with criteria of due date, cycle time, number of 
operations, set-up time and demand, is performed only at the very begining of the operation and is not updated at the 
subsequent stages. In our future work, this discrepancy will be addressed.  
 
 
5. Conclusion  
This work aims to solve the HFS scheduling problem by comparing a selected best CDR and a hybrid MCDM priority 
rule via DES modeling. The selected CDR considers a combination of Earliest Due Date,  Least Remaining number 
of operations, Least Total work content, Least Remaining work content, and Least number of operations. The MCDM 
employs the CRITIC method to weigh cirteria of due date, cycle time, number of operations, set-up time and demand, 
and VIKOR method to give priority rank to a job.Three small scale instances and a large scale realworld case are 
tested. For the makespan performance, the MCDM is found consistently performing well. On the other hand, the CDR 
surpasses the MCDM in the performance of mean flowtime, min and max tardiness. In our future work, we will 
consider updating the ranking by the MCDM rule at each new operation, making it suitable for real time application.

Abstract 
The tapioca starch industry is critical to Thailand's economy and is constantly developing to meet global market 
demands. Tapioca starch producers must refine their delivery strategies to align with customer demands efficiently, 
with a specific focus on optimizing the container-loading process, which plays a vital role in enhancing product 
delivery. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine more efficient methods to load products into containers 
using the Lean Automation concept. In this study, the researchers examined the shipping process of a tapioca starch 
factory and found that the current loading process required 82.89 minutes per container. To enhance efficiency, the 
researchers employed tools such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Cause and Effect Diagrams, and the FlexSim 
program to simulate the loading process and identify areas for improvement. The results of the simulation modeling 
of the container loading process revealed that after implementing improvements, the loading time for goods into 
containers could be reduced from 82.89 minutes per container to 77.73 minutes per container, indicating a decrease 
of 5.16 minutes per container or a 6.23 percent improvement.  When loading products into two containers 
simultaneously, the manpower required can be reduced from six to five. Additionally, it was determined that the 
number of forklifts in use could be reduced from two to one. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for 
planners engaged in warehouse and logistics operations. They can serve as a practical guide for improving the 
efficiency of loading goods into containers.

1. Introduction
Thailand's tapioca starch industry is steadily growing to meet the demands of both domestic and international markets 
because it serves as a key ingredient in various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, food production, paper 
manufacturing, and cosmetics. The tapioca starch manufacturing industry is required to engage in development in 
order to successfully meet the rising demands of customers and maintain competitiveness within the market. In the 
current situation, both labor costs and consumer quality expectations are rising. To maximize production efficiency, 
manufacturers must implement value-added techniques or technologies. This includes enhancing processes from the 
arrival of raw materials to product shipment to ensure that consumers receive high-quality and demand-satisfying 
products. 
The data from the cassava starch factory was studied as a case study. It was discovered that there was a process of 
loading products into containers in the shipping process that involved activities that did not add value to the work 
process. This research applied lean automation principles to enhance delivery process efficiency. It involves creating 
a value stream map to identify non-value-added activities, utilizing lean tools Cause and Effect Diagrams to analyze 
the causes of process issues, and employing the FlexSim software to model and analyze the container loading process 
before and after workflow improvements.

4. Results and Discussion 
The objective of this study is to enhance and optimize the efficiency of the product loading process into containers 
through the implementation of Lean Automation principles. This could be achieved by creating a model of the loading 
process and conducting a comparative analysis of the outcomes before and after implementing workflow 
improvements using the FlexSim software. It was found that the process of loading products into containers currently 
takes 82.89 minutes per container. After improvements, loading times can be reduced from 82.89 minutes per 
container to 77.73 minutes per container, or a reduction of 5.16 minutes per container, or 6.23 percent. When 
simultaneously loading products into two containers, the workforce can be reduced from six to five, and the number 
of forklifts used can be reduced from two to one.

The findings of modeling and simulation research can be used to guide improvements and increase the efficiency of 
the container loading process. It was discovered that using a product conveyor belt can help reduce time, labor, and 
the number of forklifts used in the work process. This is another method for increasing the efficiency and 
competitiveness of businesses. When implementing study results into practice and future development, additional 
variables such modifying equipment or tools to be automated should be taken into consideration.

Abstract 
Heat management of electronic device is now rapidly upgrading and considered challenging due to the increase of 
power and decreasing size of the electronic device. Due to the economic cost, system complexity and operating 
conditions, the traditional cooling methods are quite impossible. That is the reason why using of phase change material 
(PCMs) in passive cooling system is considered as a great alternative in recent years. Hydrated salt and Paraffin, which 
are known as organic phase change material (PCMs), has been greatly recommended in energy storage component 
due to its high latent heat, non-toxicity and very low melting temperature. Using the PCM energy storage and cooling 
systems lead to a significant volume reduction to store the same amount of energy compared to sensible heat storages. 
The experiment attempts to illustrate the difference in heat transfer for a heat sink with and without paraffin wax at 
different power level.

1. Introduction
Effective thermal management holds the key to the fast development and continuous miniaturization of 
microelectronics. Optimal thermal control is critical to the design and operation of electronic equipment. In several 
apps such as laptops, cell phones, digital cameras and missile control systems, the thermal management solution 
requires to be reliable, secure, cheap, light, durable and, more importantly, energy efficient. Equipment's reliability is 
a quantifier of the expected failure frequency as a function of time. Temperature is one of the most significant variables 
influencing the reliability of electronic machinery. The need to perform various tasks and the requirements for greater 
quality of electronic equipment are driving the creation of fresh and innovative thermal management methods 
According to a US Air Force study, the proportion of temperature-related failures in electronics surpassed 55 percent 
(Ala-wadhi and Amon 2000).  
Electronic manufacturing companies take it for granted that communication devices must have 99.999 percent 
reliability called 5 9 reliabilities. It means approximately 5 minutes of complete downtime in a year. However, due to 
the high expectations mentioned above, the conventional cooling meth-odds were inadequate to meet the cooling 
needs of now - a-day equipment. It has been found that a 1°C decrease in a component temperature can lower its 
failure rate by as much as 4 percent and a temperature increase of about 10–20 °C can increase its failure rate by 100 
percent (Hajmohammadi et al. 2013). 
In latest years, the use of PCM is gaining popularity in passive cooling. High latent heat of fusion per unit quantity 
and tiny volume shift during phase change are the intrinsic characteristics of PCMs. This implies that a high amount 
of energy can be stored in a fixed amount of PCM during the period of phase change. This can be seen from the 
abundance of accessible literature. Although most PCMs fulfill these criteria that are used in electronics cooling but 
unfortunately, nearly all PCMs have unacceptable low heat conductivity, which makes heating and cooling procedures 
slow during PCM melting and solidification. In order to make PCMs appropriate for cooling applications, it is essential 
to add material with high thermal conductivity to PCM which will help in heat conduction. So, the impact of PCM

From the above figures it is very clear that pin fin is very effective for better performance of PCM based heat sink as 
in every configuration and different power inputs. Fin with paraffin wax shows much more heat absorptive capacity 
than only fin. Among all the different output the lowest power (18 watt) shows the best possible outcome (largest time 
difference) of the broad study. The more power we provide the faster the process operates. For that the sink gets less 
time to absorb heat from the fins and the paraffin wax. So, we can say that the slower we provide heat the faster and 
greater the absorption process occurs. 
 
5.4 Limitations 
The experiment was conducted using a heater and power was controlled using a voltage regulator. An actual electronic 
equipment as the heat source would provide more substantial and accurate data to work with in the future. 
Also, a sounder insulation would make the data more accurate. For some electronic devices like mobile phones, an 
external cooling system using PCM material may not be a practical solution and a more practical design/method should 
be investigated. 
   
6. Conclusion 
The experimental investigation performed aimed to investigate the effect of paraffin wax also evaluate the effect of 
paraffin wax also evaluate the of volume fraction of paraffin wax and pin fin of PCM based heat sinks for heat input

Abstract 
Supplier selection is one of the most influential decision an organization can make towards their operational efficiency. 
However, this activity can become highly resource-intensive in the absence of a structured framework, especially in 
supply chains involving large numbers of components. This research aims to utilize risk assessment as a tool to screen 
for construction equipment components that should be considered for re-sourcing to new suppliers. The severities of 
risks are evaluated by cost of poor quality and occurrence by the frequency of nonconformities. High-risk components 
were selected for a change of suppliers. Multi-criteria decision-making – analytic hierarchy process (MCDM-AHP) 
is then used to determine the suitable weights of 12 supplier evaluation criteria between four different managers. 
Suppliers with the highest results are selected. Once new suppliers are selected, a second risk assessment is conducted 
to review the impact of the change in suppliers to the cost of poor quality and frequency of nonconformities.

1. Introduction
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nuclear power generation is an integral part for the world to 
reach the global objective of decarbonization. One of the most challenging entry barriers for new nuclear energy for 
many nations are the high initial construction costs and negative public opinions on nuclear power (OECD and Nuclear 
Energy Agency 2020). It does not help that many recent nuclear projects have been plagued with astronomical cost 
overruns. For example, the construction of Flamanville-3 nuclear power plant in France started in 2007 and was 
originally planned to be in operation by June 2012. 11 years later, the construction cost now is projected to reach 12.7 
billion euros, which is over 4 times the initial estimate or an equivalent of 10,000 euros added to every hour of delay 
(Overstraeten and Mallet 2022). Naturally, these figures would scare off most countries from investing into any new 
nuclear power plants. 
Although there are a multitude of reasons that would drive up the construction costs of a nuclear project, this research 
is focused on a specific area of cost overruns originating from delays caused by faulty construction equipment 
components from the equipment manufacturers’ supply chain. While construction equipment used by the nuclear 
industry may not be specialized inventions, but equipment which is also used in the construction of conventional 
buildings, their reliability level which might have been acceptable elsewhere may have a profoundly different level of 
impact to the nuclear energy industry. 
Given this context of massive costs for every hour of delays, it is of paramount importance for the construction 
equipment of nuclear facilities to operate as smoothly as possible without interruption. Otherwise, the overrun costs 
arising from the delays could quickly turn into hefty fines and penalties, beyond the price of the equipment themselves, 
to the organizations supplying them to the nuclear industry. Thus, for the construction equipment manufacturers, 
choosing the right supplier selection strategy is key to being able to secure an efficient component supply chain and 
meet the needs of the lucrative nuclear market.

5.7 Reconducting the Risk Assessment  
After the switch to new suppliers, the risk assessment is reconducted again to observe the effectiveness of the actions 
taken. The risk level comparison after the improvement actions, showing an improvement across the board in 
components MC1 through MC7 are shown in Table 16.

6. Conclusion 
The result of this research shows that when risk assessment is used to analyze the risk level from the supply chain of 
62 equipment components based on the total cost of poor quality and number of nonconformity reports, only 7 
components were rated as high or very high risks. However, these 7 components constituted 61% of all the total cost 
of poor quality generated. Therefore, new suppliers must be selected for these 7 components. 
 
In the selection of suppliers, evaluation criteria and sub-criteria must be defined while considering the risk assessment. 
The criteria were classified into four categories: quality, service, delivery, and costs. The criteria were selected from 
both established literature and consensus between experienced personnel in the field of procurement, quality 
assurance, supplier quality, and planning. 
 
Experts from each of the relevant fields determined the weight of each evaluation criteria through the use of AHP. All 
participants understood the context and relevance of the exercise with respect to the current quality issues faced by 
the organization in the supply of construction equipment to the nuclear industry. As a result, quality and service criteria 
received the higher weight at 47.8% and 25.3% respectively, while delivery and costs were weighed lower at 14.3% 
and 12.6% respectively.  
 
From the supplier evaluation criteria, 6 suppliers were analyzed. It was observed that all previous suppliers with a risk 
level of 3 or higher scored below 50% in the new evaluation metric, while their new suppliers all scored above 80% 
with their higher level of quality and service, despite their higher initial prices. 
 
Once the sources of components at level 3 or higher risks have been changed to new suppliers with higher evaluation 
scores, a revaluation of the risk level is conducted. The total cost of poor quality between the 7 parts was reduced by 
80.87%, and the frequency of nonconformities have reduced by 87.64%. The second risk assessment revealed a 
reduction in risk level of the 7 components. 1 component is now classified in the acceptable risk category, 5 in the 
low-risk category, and 1 in no-risk category. 
 
This research demonstrated the utility of risk assessment as a tool to screen and prioritize high-risk components to be 
re-sourced with weighted supplier evaluation criteria through AHP to reduce the cost of poor quality and frequency 
of nonconformities in equipment components. This type of approach is especially useful for organizations trying to 
improve the quality amongst a wide range of externally sourced components with limited resources. The level of 
severity and occurrence can be tailored to a different acceptance tolerance for a better fit with an organization’s needs 
and available resources.

Enhancing Map Design for 3-Dimensional Spatial Data 
Based on Integration of 4IR Geomatics Technologies

Abstract 
Spatial data is an integral product and part of human livelihood as society becomes more spatially enabled. Spatial 
data in form of maps and location-based services has become an integral part of the public’s livelihood in the 
information society. Maps have been historically created through the traditional cartographic process which targeted 
customers or audiences with competence in map reading. As such, these maps present geographical phenomenon in 
complex ways that are not easy to decipher by the novice user, and are of thus limited use. The novice user requires 
maps that are highly visual and interactive to easily interpret their content and make informed decisions rapidly. The 
basic data sets that are created by national mapping agencies such as topographic and cadastral maps have not 
transformed over centuries while society requires value added easy to use map products. The fourth industrial 
revolution (4IR) brings a wide array of technology for capturing and processing new forms of spatial data which can 
be integrated in the design of new and innovative map products. This requires transforming of the traditional 
cartographic process to enable the design of a wider array of products and services. The aim of this study is to explore 
a map design procedure that utilises 4IR technologies and multiple geo-visualisation aspects through supply chain 
mapping. Results reflect that changing geo-visualisation techniques within map production improves communication 
and supply chain mapping can create avenues for the design of a wide array of geospatial products.

1. Introduction
Society is becoming increasingly spatially enabled (Williamson et al. 2011) as geographical information has 
transformed from once being state owned (ANZLIC 2010) to a public good (Georgiadou et al. 2009) due to the 
increased diffusion of spatial data and enabling technologies (Çöltekin et al. 2020) that are leading to continuous 
societal transformation (Kotsev et al. 2020). Government departments use geographical information for directing 
policy interventions (Craglia and Johnston 2004), decision making (Johnson and Scassa 2023) and the public use 
location based services (Mayer et al. 2009) to navigate to different places. Spatial enablement has led to increased 
demand of geographic information that is highly visual and easy to interpret. The public utilizes geographic 
information on a day to day basis as they navigate the best routes with optimal traffic conditions to their destinations 
of choice. More and more datasets are being crowdsourced on a large scale such as location and traffic information 
(Kim et al. 2023) via google maps in order to inform motorists on traffic conditions. Elsewhere crowdsourced data is 
used in designing digital maps for informal settlements (Soman et al. 2020) and in humanitarian response mapping 
(Hunt and Specht 2019). 
The 4IR has brought forth an explosion in the availability of geographical information collected from multiple devices 
and remotely from multiple locations. The internet and availability of portable devices allows sharing and access of 
these data (Ballatore 2014) through different cloud systems and client-server architectures. Geographical Information 
Systems (GIS) technology for example enable users in remote locations to work concurrently on the same map data 
and spatial databases (Apollonio et al. 2012).

5.3 Validation 
Society is now more spatially enabled. There is need to further promote use of spatial data through creation of value 
added geographical information products by national mapping agencies to increase the spectrum of information that 
is available at nominal cost since spatial data is partly a public good. National Mapping Agencies have been mostly 
concentrating on basic country data sets such as topographical maps, cadastral layers and photogrammetric images 
(ANZLIC, 2010). There is need for products which combine multiple data sets and geo-visualisation aspects such a 
3D virtual reality for easier interpretation. This is the purpose of the supply chain mapping in figures 6 to 9 to where 
the status quo of the cartographic process is visualised and a futuristic model that can serve the needs of the wider 
spatial information community designed, 
 
The supply chain model proposed in Figure 8 and 9 details a design model for value added geographical information 
products for national mapping agencies. The supply chain comprises of multiple stakeholders including suppliers, the 
manufacturer, and customers. There is use of multiple 4IR geomatics technologies to collect raw spatial data. This 
data is transformed to multiple value added products with different geo-visualisation styles and stored in data 
warehouses and disseminated to users on demand using software as a service (SaaS). This enhanced supply chain is 
much broader than the traditional map design process in Figure 6 and 7. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Often products that have been created for a niche of specialist are often restricted regarding development of 
alternatives, variations and new products. This has been largely the situation with geographic information or geospatial 
products and services where surveyors, geodesists and geographers among other few specialists have been custodians 
of the data. Present day, the majority of the public worldwide uses maps or some form of location based service such 
as google maps, WhatsApp location, navigation applications among others. While the design theory has not more 
tailored for the manufacturing industry, this study demonstrates that, it can also be utilized in the cartographic industry 
where geospatial products and services are manufactured hence accepting the hypothesis H0. Additionally, the study 
has demonstrated the use of supply chain mapping in modelling processes involved towards producing an information 
based product or service, that is nowadays mostly in digital format, hence accepting Ha.  
The aim of this study was to provide insight to a map design procedure that incorporates multiple 4IR technologies 
and geo-visualisation aspects. This was achieved through application of supply chains to the design process. The 
geographic information supply chain needs to be agile to respond to changing customer needs and new options that 
arise due to improvement of technology in the 4th industrial revolution. This design however, introduces possible 
challenges. The greatest negative consequence to increased availability of map data is information overload. This 
increased availability of geographic information can be taken advantage by providing different geo-visualisation 
options for users to enrich the quality of information that users view. It is the role of the geomatics practitioners to 
structure the product design processes in a manner that provide multiple product and service options that are easy to 
use.

Abstract 
Biogas treatment, cleaning (removal of minor unwanted components of biogas), and upgrading (removal of 
CO2 content) leads to a more valuable renewable energy resource called biomethane which is composed of CH4 (95–
99%) and CO2 (1–5%), and no H2S. Biogas is a mixture of gases whose composition is a function of mainly the process 
control and the properties of the substrate used. Biogas is a renewable energy resource making it a valuable energy 
resource for multiple applications. Biogas is a product of the anaerobic digestion process with many applications a 
renewable energy resource. The main component of biogas with energy value is methane, but biogas has impurities 
like moisture, carbon dioxide, siloxanes, hydrogen sulphide, siloxanes, hydrocarbons, oxygen, ammonia, oxygen, 
carbon monoxide and nitrogen whose presence is undesirable as they reduce the calorific value of biogas and create 
operational problems in the energy systems. This necessitates cleaning and upgrading of biogas to produce biomethane 
or clean biogas. This study is a comparative analysis several technologies used biogas cleaning and upgrading to 
biomethane. Upgrading of biogas is possible   removal of ipurities other than methane to get biomethane which has 
several applications as a substitute for natural gas in thermal and electrical power generation. Purification or cleaning 
includes removal of moisture (H2O) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) from raw biogas. After treatment, biogas can be 
used directly to produce as a fuel or upgraded further by removal of carbon dioxide. Biomethane is a versatile biofuel 
with significant potential as a transition fuel. Commercially available technologies for purification of biogas are 
primarily meant for CO2 removal, but they can remove other impurities. The pressurized water scrubbing is the most 
used technique for removal of CO2 from biogas. Amine absorption method is preferred for use in smaller biogas 
production and in in applications with cheap heat sources while membrane permeation method has grown, because of 
availability of highly selective and low-cost polymeric materials.

Introduction 
 Biogas is a mixture of gases produced by action of microorganisms through anaerobic digestion which is a complex 
process made up of four stages i.e.: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis leading to biogas. The 
composition of biogas is influenced by  determined by the type of feedstock used and  anaerobic digestion process 
control (Struk et al. 2020).  Other than production in anaerobic digesters, biogas can also be produced from landfills 
and through biomass thermal pyrolysis and gasification processes. The mixture produced generally consists of 30-
75% methane (CH4), 25-55% carbon dioxide (CO2) and other constituents or impurities like  hydrogen (H2), oxygen 
(O2), nitrogen (N2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3), dust particles, siloxanes, aromatic and 
halogenated compounds, which are often in tiny quantities(Domingues et al. 2021). As a greenhouse gas, methane 
contributes about 21 times more to the effect, compared to carbon dioxide. Therefore, uncontrolled release of methane 
to the atmosphere should be limited.

production and can be compressed and packed as Compressed biogas (CBG) and liquid biogas (LBG) for 
many direct and indirect application as fuels in heat and power generation. Production of bio-CNG and bio-
LPG from biomethane widens its applications as direct substitute for natural gas.  
 
 Biomethane can be used in manufacture of fuels by cleaning, and purification before reforming to syngas, as well as 
by partial oxidation to produce methanol which is used to manufacture gasoline. Syngas is used in production of 
alcohols, jet fuels, diesel and gasoline through the Fischer-Tropsch process(M. J. B. Kabeyi & O. A. Olanrewaju, 
2022a, 2022e). 
 
 Systems that enable removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) and application in other processes help reinforce the 
sustainability of biogas production and the concept of circular bio-economy and should be encouraged. An example 
is biomethanol production systems integrated with biogas production and purification units which increase the 
economic value of the process and reduce environmental impact of the process. Carbon dioxide from biogas upgrading 
together with   H2, from electrolysis through electricity from renewable sources are sustainable raw materials for 
production of renewable methanol in a biogas plant 
 
4. Conclusion  
 Biogas is a gaseous product of the anaerobic digestion process with several potential applications as a renewable 
source of energy. Methane is the main component of biogas with energy value is methane, but has impurities like 
moisture, carbon dioxide, siloxanes, hydrogen sulphide, siloxanes, hydrocarbons, oxygen, ammonia, oxygen, carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen whose presence is undesirable as they reduce the calorific value of biogas and create 
operational problems in the energy systems. Biogas treatment and purification technologies will enhance the 
performance and wider application of biogas by upgrading it to biomethane for applications like fuel for vehicles and 
hydrogen production. Biomethane will also find more applications in applications where electrification in the short 
term is not possible e.g. heavy industry, long-distance transport and aviation industry. For applications like renewable 
natural gas for injection to gas grids, the upgrading facilities should achieve high methane purity and be located close 
to existing natural gas infrastructure. 
 Application of biological techniques has increased as a result of their low cost and increasing efficiency in the removal 
of H2S but the physical-chemical technologies currently dominate the market for biogas cleaning with H2S adsorption 
on activated carbon being the most used process to remove H2S in biogas. Use of salts or iron oxides in situ is a 
common practice for cleaning biogas for heat boilers while bio filters are common in H2S removal for use in combined 
heat and power (CHP) units in heat and power generation.  
To attain very low concentration of H2S, in biomethane production, requires H2S removal in combination with removal 
of CO2 has to be done. Commercially available technologies for purification of biogas are primarily meant for CO2 
removal, but they can remove other impurities. The pressurized water scrubbing is the most used technique for removal 
of CO2 from biogas. Amine absorption method is preferred for use in smaller biogas production and in in applications 
with cheap heat sources while membrane permeation method has grown, because of availability of highly selective 
and low-cost polymeric materials. Circumstances that may be unique or specific to a project and raw biogas capacity 
may significantly affect the cost of different upgrading technologies.

Abstract 
Sugarcane bagasse is a by-product milling sugarcane  and it is an important fuel resource for the 
sugar industry. Bagasse is a fibrous, has low  density material and has a wide range of  particle 
sizes with  high moisture content. Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is among the most abundant agricultural residues 
globally in sugar producing countries. Bagasse is mainly used as a fuel for cogeneration by the sugar factories, but 
has other applications like ethanol production, paper and pulp manufacture, biogas production and charcoal briquettes 
manufacture. The falling electricity prices and reducing global sugar prices due to excess sugar stock in the world 
market have made bagasse a very attractive fuel for grid-based electricity generation and supply making it a feasible 
diversification pathway for sugar factories. This study identifies the various physical, chemical, and thermodynamic 
properties of bagasse and sugar cane trash as fuels in the sustainable energy transition.  The study recommends various 
policy initiatives to promote the use of bagasse and cane trash as a fuel particularly in heat and power generation. 
Proposed measures include attractive feed in tariffs for cogenerated heat and power, tax incentives and measures to 
encourage investment, and a flexible power purchase agreement that recognizes the unique challenges facing the 
sugarcane manufacturing like unsteady supply of cane and hence inconsistent milling and fuel supply. Bagasse has 
various pathways for exploitation as an energy resource i.e., direct combustion in boilers to produce heat for steam 
and power generation, anaerobic digestion to produce biogas and pyrolysis and gasification to produce syngas. Syngas 
and biogas can further be upgraded to produce   biomethane which has significant energy and process applications as 
a substitute of natural gas. Bagasse has got three e major components, namely pith, fiber, and rind, 
Key Words: bagasse; cane rash; bagasse cogeneration. 
Introduction  
 Sugarcane is a major crop in many countries globally grown commercially for the production of sugar abundant. 
Sugarcane plant has one of the highest bioconversion efficiencies with ability to efficiently fix solar energy, to yield 
up to 55 tons of dry matter annually per hectare of land under cultivation. The harvested sugarcane leaves behind cane 
trash as the cane is transported to a sugar factory where it is crushed to extract juice at the mills or the diffuser leaving 
behind energy rich fibrous bagasse as the sugar is taken to the process house for sugar making(M. Kabeyi & O. 
Olanrewaju  2021; Kabeyi  2020; Kabeyi 2022). Sugarcane bagasse is a renewable feedstock used for power 
generation and manufacturing cellulosic ethanol in among other applications(Kabeyi  2020) . The energy potential of 
bagasse produced is more than enough to meet the heat and electricity energy needs of a traditional as well as modern 
sugar factory, making sugar factories ideal for grid based decentralized power generation. The main challenge facing 
many traditional sugar factories is that the existing technology adopted is inefficiently designed maximize bagasse 
burning as a disposal strategy and energy supply limited energy for the factory use (Ike 2013; M. J. B. Kabeyi & O. 
A. Olanrewaju 2022c).
The global price of sugar  and petroleum products have shown  variations since 1973,  but the long term outlook shows 
a  gradual increase fossil fuel prices  and stagnation, in the price of sugar(Paturau, 2012). This scenario explains, to a 
large degree, global interest in diversification by the sugar industry   which shows that  optimal use of sugar  production

Abstract 
Distributed energy systems (DES) have significant potential to enhance sustainability of electricity systems. 
Decentralized generation systems are   small-scale power technologies generally ranging between 3 kW– 10 MW 
located very close to consumers to provide an alternative or enhancement to the centralized or conventional power 
system. The DGs are connected directly to the distribution system or on the customer side of the meter which 
significantly reduces the. transmission and distribution losses of the power system. The high consumption of fossil 
fuels and global commitments to reduction in energy related emissions has generated huge interest in renewable energy 
resources for use in power generation. This has increased the opportunities of utilizing decentralist generation systems 
in power generation. The renewable DG systems may be connected to the grid for peak shaving or as a stand-alone 
system to serve a particular load or an area. Integrating renewable DGs to the power system has many benefits as well 
as threats if not well coordinated and integrated into the power system. High penetration of renewables can cause 
several adverse effects on the distribution systems. like voltage rise, reverse power flow, high line losses, creation of 
harmonics and reduction in voltage quality. Decentralized power systems units should be designed and operated within 
limits to maintain optimal quality of the power system There is therefore need for optimal sizing and location of 
renewable decentralized generation (DG) units in the distribution power system for technical and economic benefits. 
The penetration of renewable decentralized generation systems is considered as a significant contribution to the world 
energy and environmental crisis 
Key words:  
decentralized generation, sustainable energy; distributed generation 
Introduction 
There is need to develop more flexible electricity networks for the purpose of power distribution as opposed to the 
current practice in centralized power systems where the operators just transmit power and keep the grid stable. A 
desirable future power grid should have inbuilt flexibility approaches and methods like demand-side response, 
intelligence, and energy storage. This marks the transformation to distributed generation is which is a new approach 
in the in the power sector(Lund et al. 2017).  There are many definitions for decentralized generation e.g., the Anglo-
American often use ‘embedded generation’, while in North America, it is often referred to as ‘dispersed generation’. 
In Europe and parts of Asia, it is often referred to as ‘decentralized generation’.(Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi & 
Oludolapo Akanni  Olanrewaju 2022; Kabeyi & Oludolapo 2020a). Distributed generation (DG) is proving to be a 
very important more important future generation system that is rapidly evolving in competitive electricity markets. 
Distributed generation is generally defined as an electric power generation system within distribution networks or on 
the customer side of the network (Ackermann et al. 2001; Moses  Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju 2022).   The main purpose 
of distributed generate  on is to supply active power to the grid.  
Therefore distributed generation does not have to supply reactive power to the power system(Ackermann et al. 2001). 
The distributed generation units are installed and connected directly to the distribution network or they can be

From table 3, it is noted that different technologies can be selected for use in distributed generation. They include fuel 
cells turbines and microturbines and reciprocating engines with fuel cells being the most efficient and microturbines 
being the most inefficient. The reciprocating engines and microturbines are the cheapest to install while fuel cells are 
the most expensive per unit power output.  
 
6.7. Renewable Sources for Distributed Generation 
 Renewable sources play an important role in decentralized generation since most locally available sources of energy 
are in the form of renewable energy. The characteristics of these renewable energy sources used in distributed 
generation are summarized in table 4.

From table 4, it shown that different renewable sources of energy can be used in decentralised generation. The sources 
of energy include solar using solar photovoltaics and solar thermal, biomass using gasification technology, geothermal 
and battery storage.

The main drivers for decentralised generation are the need to use more clean and sustainable nature of renewable 
resources compared to the polluting and limited fossil traditionally used in power generation. State and governmental 
commitment advance broader integration of renewable energies and enforcement of the clean environmental agenda 
to mitigate greenhouse gasses emissions and combat climate change are other factors in increasing adoption of 
decentralised generation. Renewable DGs offer several benefits like energy sustainability, being emission free, and 
energy security]. Policies and regulations used to support investments in renewable DGs, are renewable development 
and reinforcement of portfolio standards, use of public benefit funds for renewable energy, application of  output-
based environmental regulations, development of standards interconnection, application of  net metering, attractive 
feed-in tariffs, and tax incentives.

Abstract 
Micro grids constitute the ultimate form of decentralized electricity, heat and cold supply whose operations separated 
from the main distribution system i.e. autonomous or connected to the distribution system i.e. grid-connected. Grid-
connected micro grid can be of help during a system fault, by supplying power to the main distribution system, feeding 
part of its loads for fault detection and service restoration. Micro grids have emerged as a competitive alternative to 
the final delivery of energy to consumers in combination with on-site production of heat. Distributed generation 
grouped in micro grids can introduce a richer set of tools for supply of o heat and power, at higher reliability, security, 
flexibility and power quality in the conventional grid. A micro grid is typically managed through a central controller 
that monitors the system parameters, coordinates energy resources, balances loads and controls electrical loads, and 
disconnects and reconnects of the micro grid to the primary grid. Micro grids with no central controller are not common 
but are technically feasible, with distributed energy resource having an individual controller and the individual 
controllers operate in a coordinated manner.   
Micro grids can be an effective option to increase the energy resilience, by providing a functional electric power 
system capable of operating independently of the main grid. The main grid usually supplies primary power, while the 
micro grid provides secondary dispatchable power in the event of a grid failure. Emergency diesel generators can 
provide power directly to loads in the event failure of the primary grid and the micro grid. Proper design and planning 
of microgrids is important for them to yield all the advantages of the distributed energy concept for the power systems, 
both local and the clinked central power system. This calls for a reliability -oriented design for microgrids that utilise 
a large share of the variable and intermittent renewable energy-based, and power electronics-interfaced distributed 
energy resources. Experience has shown that the power electronics used are prone to wear-out failure and can 
potentially have adverse effects on the on the performance of the entire power electrics dominated power system. The 
many benefits associated with application of microgrids have contributed to their significant growth and penetration 
in decentralized power generation globally. However, challenges are still encountered with respect to design, operation 
and control for both island and on grid mode of operation.

Introduction 
Microgrids constitute a technology option that can help deliver a sustainable and efficient power system by employing 
distributed or decentralised energy resources for efficient generation and supply local electricity load and increase the 
reliability of a local distribution network(Sandelic et al. 2022). The microgrid concept has gained popularity recently 
as a result of the need for modernization of the grid modernization, reduction in the use of fossil fuel-based power 
generation, and maximum integration of new technologies and variable renewables. Physically, microgrids are 
electrical structures interconnecting small decentralized generation sources located close to the load centers or point 
of electricity consumption. Microgrids are often connected to larger distribution power systems, but have ability to 
operate independently(M. Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju 2022; Kabeyi 2012; Sandelic et al. 2022). as demonstrated in

 Microgrids constitute a technology option that can help deliver a sustainable and efficient power system by employing

the performance of the entire power electrics dominated power system. Micro grids constitute an ultimate form of 
decentralized electricity, heat and cold supply, with operations separated from the main distribution system as 
autonomous systems or connected to the distribution systems as grid-connected systems.  Grid-connected micro grid 
can be of help during a system fault, by supplying power to the main distribution system, feeding part of its loads for

Microgrids have expanded in scale of operation, coverage and penetration due to their e significant benefits. The 
deployment of microgrids is however still facing challenges to efficiently design, control, and operate them both as 
off grid and islanded systems hence the need for extensive research activities. As a result of the need to have an across-
the-board view of the microgrid integration in power systems, this study presented a review of issues concerning 
microgrids and identified various aspects of microgrids including their role in distributed generation, microgrid value 
propositions, the applications of applications of power electronics, and other system elements, microgrid benefits and 
limitations and areas for further research.

Abstract 
Fuel cells convert the chemical energy of in fuel mainly hydrogen efficiently to electricity without combustion. The 
process has significantly low emissions with water as the main product of the reaction   compared to conventional 
equipment/techniques that are associate with greenhouse gas emissions. The three main parts of a fuel cell assemble 
are the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. A catalyst oxidizes fuel with ions travelling via the electrolyte. At the cathode 
ions are reunited with the electrons. It is the electrons produced at the cathode that generate electrons which make the 
electrical circuit. Fuel cells development  partially focuses on optimization of catalytic  the layer 0f the 
catalytic electrodes, and by reducing  metal without appreciable loss of the fuel cell performance. For fuel cells, power 
supply is uninterrupted during fuel supply and the oxidant, unlike a battery which relies on stored energy and is 
affected by amount of reagent available. The  theoretical  efficiency fuel cells is about 90%  while in thermal engines 
the efficiency is about  40% for optimum conditions. However, practical fuel cell efficiency is usually less than 60%. 
which is still significantly greater than efficiency of combustion engines.  The fuel cells operate with continuous 
replenishment of the fuel, and the oxidant at active electrode area and with no need for recharging. The elements of a 
fuel cell are the electrode, an oxidant or an air electrode, and an electrolyte. Common fuel cells used are hydrogen, 
oxygen (H2, O2), hydrazine (N2H4, O2), carbon/coal (C, O2) methane (CH4, O2). Hydrogen-powered fuel cells emit 
only water with virtually no pollutant emissions. On the other hand, fuel cells powered by hydrocarbon-based fuels 
have the potential to Employing hydrocarbon-based fuel inevitably leads to CO2 emission.  Since fuel cells are not 
subject to the limitations of the Carnot cycle efficiency, fuel cells attain higher efficiency that can be more than twice 
the efficiency of internal combustion engines. The transport sector operates with fuel cells having efficiency of up to 
65%, compared to 25% for internal combustion engines.  Application of heat produced by in fuel cells reaction for in

Introduction 
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices used for the continuous conversion part of the free energy change in a chemical 
reaction to electrical energy. The fuel cells operate with continuous replenishment of the fuel, and the oxidant at active 
electrode area and with no need for recharging. The elements of a fuel cell are the electrode, an oxidant or an air 
electrode, and an electrolyte. Common fuel cells used are hydrogen, oxygen (H2, O2), hydrazine (N2H4, O2), 
carbon/coal (C, O2) methane (CH4, O2).   A fuel cell is a device akin a battery that continuously recharges as it generates 
electric power using low-temperature electrochemical reaction oxygen and hydrogen. Unlike storage batteries whose 
main objective is to store energy, fuel cell fuel cells continuously generate as long as there is continuous supply of 
fuel and oxygen. Fuel cells employ   an external or internal fuel-reforming process using any hydrogen-rich fuel can 
in different types of fuel cells. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells emit only water with virtually no pollutant emissions. On 
the other hand, fuel cells powered by hydrocarbon-based fuels have the potential to Employing hydrocarbon-based 
fuel inevitably leads to CO2 emission.  Since fuel cells are not subject to the limitations of the Carnot cycle efficiency,

refuelling stations across the transport networks and need to reduce the cost of hydrogen fuels   and hydrogen-based 
systems. An integrated hydrogen energy system of the future should combine small and large fuel cells for industrial 
and domestic decentralised heat and electricity power generation with extended hydrogen supply networks that can 
also fuel conventional internal combustion or fuel cell vehicles

Abstract 
The objective of urban logistics can be defined as finding efficient and effective ways to transport goods in urban 
areas. Although urban logistics is extremely important for a city, as it delivers goods to residents and ensures 
adequate supplies in stores, it may potentially generate social, environmental, and economic externalities on the 
urban landscape. Because of these opposing factors, designing and managing an urban logistics system is quite 
challenging. On top of that, due to the ever-changing technological landscapes, various uncertainties, and driving 
forces present in the system, its development cannot be projected simply by extrapolating past and current trends. 
To achieve a sustainable urban logistics future, planners and stakeholders need to develop a well-informed, long-
term understanding of urban logistics to address challenges that lie beyond the horizon. In this paper, we introduce 
our ongoing foresight study and discuss the significance of adopting such tools in planning for the future of urban 
logistics where a high degree of uncertainty is present in the system.

Abstract 
The study is an approach on the quantitative method. Accordingly, the survey is conducted on 246 respondents who 
are Gen Z (10-25 years old) and living at Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). Based on the qualitative method with literature 
review and expert evaluation, six factors of entertainment, informativeness, irritation, credibility, narrative 
engagement, and social aspect are explored and employed in the research model. The quantitative method of 
Exploratory Factor Analysis is applied to test how a relationship between six factors and attitude toward podcast ads 
and between attitude toward podcast ads and the adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes. In parallel, 
the group testing is also taken into account of the study, this is a support to confirm which group of gender, income, 
and online time are more involved in the adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes.

Introduction 
It is remarkable how quickly podcasts have expanded in popularity since the advent of digital media, particularly in 
more industrialized nations. This matter is establishing a pattern among the younger generation in Vietnam. Over the 
past few years, there has been a rise in podcast awareness in Vietnam, and the market for podcasts is expanding within 
the media and entertainment industry. In point of fact, various podcast systems and programs like Spotify, Apple 
Podcasts, and SoundCloud have opened up shop in Vietnam, providing users with access to a wide variety of 
information in a format that is both handy and accessible. The introduction and expansion of these platforms have 
helped to contribute to the expansion of podcast outreach and marketing. 
Podcasts in Vietnam range from entertainment and personal discussion shows to educational programs, news 
broadcasts, and sports coverage. This ensures that listeners can pick from a wide range of options and piques the 
interest of diverse demographics. The number of Vietnamese people making podcasts is growing. Numerous podcasts 
are released, and those already in existence improve and expand. The podcasting sector in Vietnam has benefited from 
this enhanced community interaction. Podcasting has gained popularity and attention in Vietnam, but it is still in its 
infancy and confronts obstacles like competition from other media and the need to diversify its material to attract 
listeners. 
Launched in 2017, the Podcast Trends Report is an effort to better understand podcast listener behavior, set standards 
for podcast trends, and assess the effectiveness of podcast advertising. According to the 2019 Podcast Trends Report, 
based on the survey, 82.4% of people listen to podcasts for more than 7 hours per week, 33.2% of people listen to 
podcasts using smart speakers, 59% of people say they spend more time listening to podcasts than they do on social 
media, and 55.6% of people make a purchase after hearing an advertisement during a podcast. Sixty-one percent of 
podcasters say that building an audience and promoting their shows are the biggest challenges they face. 
Podcasting is a popular kind of media that is starting to break out internationally. The growing number of Vietnamese 
podcasts indicates that the industry is actively exploring and expanding opportunities in the country. As a result of 
their mobility, originality, popularity, efficiency, and capacity to target certain niches, the podcast business is set to 
boom in Vietnam and internationally in the near future.

Conclusion and recommendations 
Research results of 246 respondents in the age group of Generation Z give a general picture of their behavior. Attitude 
towards podcast ads is depended on impacts of informativeness, credibility, narrative engagement, irritation, and social 
aspect. In which irritation has a negative impact. In addition, a significant impact of attitude towards podcast ads on 
the adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes is confirmed. It's also important to note that, different 
genders, incomes, and time spent online watching and listening to podcast ads, don't all have different views on the 
adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes. 
As resulted, some recommendations should be considered. Firstly, a successful podcast adds requires an understanding 
of who are target audience. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to their interests and preferences. 
This will help the company choose advertisers and products that align with your audience's needs and interests. 
Secondly, be mindful of the frequency and placement of ads. Too many ads can be overwhelming and lead to listener 
drop-off. Consider spacing out ads throughout your episode or concentrating them at the beginning or end. In sum, 
Encouraging audience to embrace online advertising within podcast episodes requires a strategic approach that 
maintains their trust and keeps them engaged. Here's how the company can make the adoption of online advertising 
more appealing to your podcast audience:

Abstract 
This study is to propose a framework for sustainable supplier evaluation and optimal allocation of orders for multi-
product and multi-period. In order to forecast demand, the study employed a machine learning algorithm. 
Concurrently, an integrated Mathematical programming model, encompassing four crucial sustainability factors, is 
formulated. This model effectively allocates purchase orders to suppliers based on the outcomes of the evaluation 
process. The model also accommodates the distribution of orders across various time frames and diverse product 
categories. Subsequently, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are assessed through sensitivity 
analysis via a real-world case study implemented within an authentic supply chain setting.

1. Introduction
Supplier selection is the process of identifying, evaluating, and making decisions on selecting and contracting 
suppliers. As every order fulfilled starts with the decision on identifying the appropriate suppliers, the selection of 
suppliers has been recognized as one of the critical issues in organizations that determine the ability to successfully 
satisfy demands while maintaining a strategically competitive position in the market (Gupta et al. 2019). The decision 
made in supplier selection determines the results of other closely related problems, such as optimal order allocation. 
Order allocation is the process of determining the quantity and assigning orders to specific suppliers. The question of 
how to distribute orders to the appropriate suppliers is one that frequently comes up, especially in the case of multiple 
suppliers (Kawtummachai & Van Hop  2005). Proper supplier selection allows optimal order allocation by linking the 
evaluation scores of the suppliers with the corresponding quantity ordered. By selecting the most appropriate suppliers 
for each order, companies can minimize delays and disruptions, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. All 
of this help to optimize the supply chain operations in a timely, cost-effective, and efficient manner. 
The world has witnessed a growing awareness of environmental and social issues related to the operation of supply 
chains. Due to the increasingly important environmental and social considerations in supplier selection and supply 
chain operations, not only are economic factors taken into account but organizations are pressured to consider 
environmental and social aspects in their supply chain practices, forming the three pillars in the process of sustainable 
supplier selection. 
The inter-relationship between supplier selection and order allocation has resulted in numerous research and studies 
on this topic. However, there is an insufficiency of supplier selection-order allocation models that focus on all three 
sustainable elements of economic, environmental, and social. Furthermore, not all of the proposed models have wide 
applicability due to the exclusion of factors such as multi-product and multi-period.

The total purchasing cost calculated from this model is 100,111,150,000.00 VND, which is 644,865,000.00 more than 
the initial results. However, the total transportation distance is cut down by half, which is now 2,632.4 km. The average 
defective fractions, timely delivery rates, and environmental scores are better: 0.0152 (decreases by 0.0745%), 0.9698 
(increases by 0.405%), and 2.8 (increases by 0.2 points), correspondingly. This means that although choosing one 
supplier per product can increase the purchasing cost, the values of the other metrics are improved. However, if this 
is applied in reality, the risk of supply disruption can be high. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study proposes an framework for sustainable supplier evaluation and allocating orders for a multi-product spice 
company. The findings demonstrate that each product is supplied by two different providers, with orders aligned to 
meet demand, ensuring all requirements are fulfilled. When changing the weights of the criteria so that cost-related 
criteria are more emphasized, the model gives out a much lower total purchasing cost, but also values that are less 
desirable in other criteria. It is also observed that changing the minimum value number of suppliers results in better 
average defective fractions, timely delivery rates, and environmental scores at the expense of increased purchasing 
costs and higher risk of supply disruption. The model proposed in this study covers the fundamental aspects in 
sustainable supplier selection and order allocation, and can be applied in not only the spice industry but also other 
fields as well. This paper, however, does have some limitations. First, all parameters are considered to be constant, 
and data uncertainty is omitted, which can be inaccurate in practice. Second, the sustainable issue of supply chain 
interruption is only dealt with by requiring at least two suppliers for each product, while the social issues focus solely 
on the supplier element rather than all stakeholders of the supply chain. Hence, additional techniques for dealing with 
this problem should be developed. 
 
For future research, the forecasting methods should be compared to other algorithms and techniques for more accurate 
forecasting. Fuzzy numbers should be used to estimate uncertain input parameters, meaning  that some constraints and 
objective functions could also be fuzzy. Lastly, since the sustainable issues in supplier selection and order allocation 
comprise various aspects and hence can be complicated, it is recommended that the model consider these aspects more 
deeply to further emphasize the importance of sustainability in the supply chain.

Abstract 
This study aims to address the One-Dimensional Cutting Stock Problem (1D-CSP) by developing an optimized 
approach for designing cutting plans for one-dimensional construction materials with the primary goal of 
minimizing material waste during the cutting process. The methodology involves the implementation of a Matlab 
algorithm based on linear programming principles and uses data derived from previous studies to formulate 
efficient cut-off plans. The investigation entails an analysis of the collected data from relevant studies, focusing 
on total material consumption and loss within the cutting plans. The study begins by considering foundational 
variables, which encompass the length of the standard linear inventory, the required lengths for each type, and 
the overall quantity of required lengths. These parameters are then processed using Matlab software to establish 
a solution through linear programming. The comparative analysis involves evaluating the collected data to 
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model. This comparison encompasses the assessment of standard 
linear inventory utilization, material utilization effectiveness, and the residual waste generated during the cutting 
process.  In comparison to the first relevant research, the developed method yields a material cutting plan with 
a loss rate of 1.21%, requiring less than one standard linear material inventory—improving upon the original 
result of 1.24%. Similarly, when compared to the second relevant study involving ten cases, the developed 
method generates a material cutting plan with a loss rate of 6.45%, utilizing fewer than three standard linear 
materials.

1. Introduction
Today's businesses are highly competitive, and cutting production costs is one way to gain a competitive advantage. 
Cutting production costs to a minimum while maintaining or increasing production efficiency and effectiveness is 
another way to gain a competitive advantage. Reduced depreciation and material costs should also be prioritized 
because the cost of raw materials is typically the highest. As a result, it is clear that if we are successful in lowering 
costs and developing effective strategies, the overall cost of doing business can be reduced (Vacharapoom 2013). 
Furthermore, the general manufacturing industry requires one-dimensional linear materials, which result in a large 
number of losses in the cutting process as well as a constant increase in labor costs and inflation, which raises the cost 
of raw materials. And then there is the issue of waste from production, which is waste from creating a linear material 
cutting plan. As a result, this issue must be addressed immediately. There are also issues with the impact of COVID-
19, the US-China trade war, and the Russian-Ukrainian state war, all of which have significantly impacted the 
industrial cost of steel required. As a result, one of the most direct solutions to the problem is the cost-effective use of 
one-dimensional linear materials with minimal loss. Another advantage is that it reduces environmental problems by 
reducing waste and scrap from construction materials.

particularly in the cases of Min. Length, Random, and Greedy Random. While the results were similar to the Max. 
Length heuristic in case studies 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10, it outperformed the heuristic in case studies 2, 3, and 9 due to 
the more efficient use of the standard linear inventory. The improvement increased overall efficiency by 6.45 percent. 
 
4. Conclusion and Discussion 
The goal of the research was to develop a one-dimensional linear material cutting plan to reduce losses during the 
cutting process. This was accomplished using a Matlab software and included a thorough investigation of 11 case 
studies. These comprised one case study from the research titled ""A cutting plan of one-dimensional construction 
materials to reduce loss in construction  projects"" (Vacharapoom 2013) and an additional 10 case studies drawn from 
research exploring ""Heuristic Approaches for One Dimensional Cutting Stock Problems"" (Nuchsara and Preecha, 
2009) ""The primary goal of this study is to delve into the realm of one-dimensional linear material cutting. Through 
this investigation, the aim is to comprehensively understand the outcomes of one-dimensional linear material cutting, 
focusing on factors such as achieved results, minimized usage of standard linear materials, optimized cutting 
efficiency, and reduced waste in the cutting process. These objectives are pursued by employing computational 
techniques, particularly Linear Programming with the aid of the Matlab, to analyze the problem, find solutions, and 
generate cutting plans.

The conclusions drawn from the utilization of Matlab software are as follows: Employing Matlab for solving cutting 
problems and formulating one-dimensional linear material cutting plans leads to heightened efficiency in the one-
dimensional material cutting process. This approach not only minimizes scrap but also contributes to an overall 
increase in efficiency. As a result, it can be concluded that the construction of one-dimensional linear cutting plots 
using MATLAB can be used to solve the problem of one-dimensional linear cutting in order to achieve the best 
efficiency and reduce scrap of the material cutting process.

Abstract 
In recent years, Mypes in the health sector have been affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which allowed the 
identification of certain deficiencies present in the service model. This case study focuses on dental centers because 
according to research, it is one of the areas with the highest risk of contagion, which is why they saw the need to 
implement new procedures that guarantee the safety of the service, which decreased their operational performance. 
This article proposes an integrated application of Lean Healthcare in a dental center, managing to improve its 
performance through the measurement of KPI's. The Lean Healthcare application improved the performance of dental 
centers, which was evidenced by the results of indicators such as decreased cycle time and waiting time.

1. Introduction
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a health pandemic caused by COVID-19 [1]. 
Consequently, the Peruvian government promulgated, on March 15, through Supreme Decree No. 184-2020-PCM, 
mandatory social immobilization. This measure had various multisectoral impacts, where the most affected were small 
and medium-sized companies. 
In Peru, MYPES represented 19% of GDP in 2019, reaching a sale of 148,276 million soles and employing 8.75 
million workers; therefore, they are classified as key pieces of the country's economy. However, in 2020, they 
represented 8% of GDP, which reduced their contribution by 57.9% compared to the previous year [2]. MYPES in the 
health sector have not been indifferent to these impacts; for example, dental centers have been pointed out as potential 
points of contagion, this because dental procedures have a high risk of infection by Covid-19 and dentistry has been 
identified as one of the professions with the highest risk of infection [3]. For this reason, dental centers are obliged to 
follow the procedures issued by the Colegio Odontológico del Perú (COP) to act during the health emergency caused 
by COVID 19 and after it, because the procedures that they carry out daily expose them to contaminating particles 
that affect the staff health. 
This has led to an accidental rethinking of the service model offered, generating increased waste, disorganization, 
increased waiting time for patients and a longer cycle time. This change in the model has highlighted and aggravated 
the current operational problems, that translate   into a decrease of the capacity service.

6. Conclusion 
In this case study, it was identified that the healing procedure is the most frequent; Therefore, the improvements 
focused on the service flow of this. However, many of the improvements impact the service flow of the other 
procedures. 
 
In line with what was mentioned, there were quantifiable and non-quantifiable root causes, of which all the non-
quantifiable ones were solved and the most relevant 80% of the quantifiable ones were selected. These root causes 
were reflected in the long waiting time of patients; inefficient use of the work area, low service capacity and high 
number of claims, for these inputs the 5S and VSM tool was selected, although the use of each tool was specifically 
established for each input, they had a synergistic effect. 
 
The deployment of this research followed the DMAIC methodology, which established the stages to follow in logical 
sequence to achieve improvements, it can be concluded that the use of this methodology helped to maintain order and 
continuous monitoring throughout the research process. 
 
Finally, it was evidenced that these improvements had a positive impact on the financial results of the company, 
obtaining an increase of 19.49 percentage points in the net margin, for which a demand of 12 patients per day was 
considered. Likewise, the service capacity amounts to 17 patients; Therefore, if efforts are made to increase demand 
and work at 100% of its capacity, a net margin of 73.60% would be reached, which increases by 8.02 percentage 
points with respect to the margin obtained with 12 patients.

Abstract 
Public transportation is vital for societal well-being, impacting economic, social, and environmental aspects. The Bus 
Rapid Transit (BRT) system, an urban traffic solution, requires effective strategies. To address the traffic problem in 
Ho Chi Minh city, BRT implementation has been proposed, specifically for the Vo Van Kiet - Mai Chi Tho boulevards 
as a pilot. However, there are scant assessments on how this system should be implemented effectively, especially by 
simulation  approach, which could help to test different scenarios, saving huge money and time for real operation.   In 
this study, we use discrete event simulation to explore different scenarios for implementing a BRT system in the case 
of Vo Van Kiet - Mai Chi Tho boulevards in Ho Chi Minh city. Simulation optimization via OpQuest in ARENA is 
used to suggest the best operation plan in terms of number of buses, speed and waiting time. In addition, Multiple 
Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach is also employed to evaluate the solution priorties. This study offers a 
practical framework for decission makers to solve the urban mobility challenges.

1. Introduction
The Management Board of Urban Traffic Construction Investment and Construction of HCMC has approved policies, 
regulations and institutions to decide the first BRT route investment on Vo Van Kiet and Mai Chi Tho boulevards 
since 2015. The main reason is the heavy traffic congestion in this area, particularly during peak hours. The route 
connects two key areas in the city, the western and eastern parts, and serves as a major transportation corridor for 
commuters and goods. Additionally, the route was selected because it is relatively straight and has wide lanes, making 
it easier to construct dedicated bus lanes and stations. The construction of the BRT system on this route aimed to 
improve the efficiency and reliability of public transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and decrease the 
environmental impact of transportation in the city. Furthermore, several major public transportation systems in the 
city, including the future metro lines and existing bus routes, making it easier for commuters to transfer between 
modes of transportation. Overall, the selection of this route for the first BRT system in HCMC was a strategic decision 
to address the city's transportation challenges and improve mobility for its residents.  
The objective of this study is to explore different scenarios of implementing the BRT line in Vo Van Kiet - Mai Chi 
Tho boulevards in Ho Chi Minh city and propose the most promising operation plan. This study offers a practical 
framework for decission makers to solve the urban mobility challenges. 
2. Literature Review
The traffic management challenges usually involve many objectives, criteria and uncertainties. Thus, Multiple Criteria 
Decision-Making (MCDM) approach, multi-objective models and simulation are frequently found in the literature to 
address this problem. For instance, (Aramesh & Ghorbanian  2020) explore a multi-objective approach in traffic 
management, employing OptQuest optimization for Arena simulation to minimize wait times and air pollution at a T 
intersection with traffic lights. (Yang & Liu 2020) work also employs a multi-objective approach to optimize energy

With the higher BNP, option of accelerating the BRT buses is preferred over the option of adding buses to the normal 
line. Accelerating BRT buses can reduce waiting times and emissions, boosting the attractiveness of public transport 
and aligning with eco-friendly goal.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study successfully developed a BRT optimization model using OptQuest for Arena software. It aims to minimize 
passenger waiting time and vehicle energy consumption through real-world simulations of Bus 39 and Bus D4 in Vo 
Van Kiet - Mai Chi Tho boulevards. MCDM method is also employed to reaffirm the need of implementing the BRT 
line over other options. This approach can be applied for other similar contexts, promoting urban mobility and 
accessibility with prudent implementation management amid potential infrastructure challenges. 
 
Future research could expand analyses to diverse routes and conditions while integrating real-time bus data to enhance 
decision-making precision.

Abstract 
Infants undergo rapid development in the initial two years, which underscores the importance of proper and adequate 
nutrition. This emphasizes the importance of the quality and availability of Infant Formula Milk (IFM), which plays 
a vital role as it is crucial for infants' growth and development especially when there is an absence of mother's milk. 
Over the last decade, the IFM supply chain has faced various risks and disruptions all over the globe. These disruptions 
vary in origin, magnitude, and impact on the product and the supply chain continuity. In this research, we provide a 
general framework for leveraging the resilience of IFM supply chain. The framework begins by analyzing different 
stages and processes of the IFM supply chain starting from the cultivation product development phase until the IFM 
product reaches retailer stores. After that, through adapting the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) application 
to the supply chain, the possible risks were detected. The risks were categorized to prioritize critical ones, enabling 
the formulation of a general contingency plan to leverage the resilience of the IFM supply chain. K means ++ and K 
clustering algorithms were used to cluster the risks based on severity, using eight attributes that are cost, product 
availability/quantity, lead times, health impact, probability of occurrence, risk velocity, risk detectability, and risk 
persistence. These attributes were evaluated for each risk based on the experience of the team, where as a result the 
most critical 17 risks were identified and targeted to mitigate their possible negative effect. The mitigation plan was 
built from a general subset of proactive and reactive measures that target critical risks using both standard mitigation 
practices and innovative practices involving the use of industry 4.0 technologies. As a result, the IFM supply chain 
can be more resilient toward unexpected disruptions.

Abstract 
To get a holistic view of the board of directors’ characteristics as well as the influence of these characteristics on firm 
performance in financial and accounting studies. By using a systematic review, the results show that (1) most of the 
studies use the representative theory; (2) studies on the key characteristics of BOD are still limited, mainly focusing 
on corporate and board-level issues rather than organizational and individual-level issues; (3) the current studies are 
methodologically limited (inconsistent definitions and measures, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative 
research methods).

1. Introduction
Research on the characteristics of BOD as well as the effects of BOD has increased over the past decades, the most 
challenging and important issue in this field of CG is BOD characteristics (Zattoni and Van Ees 2012). The structure, 
characteristics, and diversity of the BOD, as well as the relationship of these BOD’s characteristics with the company's 
financial and non-financial performance, demonstrate the complexity of BOD as well as its importance and the need 
for academic research in this field (Erhardt et al. 2003). BOD has been studied extensively (Beasley and Salterio 2001; 
Adams and Flynn 2005; Abbott et al. 2012; Madsen 2013; Haque 2017; Khatib et al. 2020). In fact, more and more 
CG regulations and laws are being established to regulate BOD’s behaviors and promote transparency, especially in 
the context of financial crises and major CG scandals (Cuom et al. 2016). 
As an important part of the CG mechanism, BOD has attracted the interest of scholars and policymakers (Wang and 
Hussainey 2013). Cadbury (1992) divides power in a firm between the CEO and the chairman because the author is 
concerned about CEO duality. Following the major worldwide business scandals of the 1990s and 2000s, the necessity 
to develop and maintain CG regulation has become critical (Millar et al. 2005). The emphasis on BOD’s regulations 
has sparked a lot of interest. As a result, crucial questions must be addressed: (i) what variables impact a company's 
board of directors? (ii) how do the characteristics of a company's board of directors affect its financial and non-
financial performance? While much study on BOD’s characteristics has been conducted from a range of theoretical 
viewpoints, but still a lack of holistic knowledge on these characteristics through a systematic review. As such, this 
gap is the motivation to conduct this research.  
Therefore, the main objective of this study is to contribute to the existing literature by addressing the above-mentioned 
questions through a systematic review of BOD’s characteristics and the relationships between these characteristics 
with company performance (firm performance, FP). Specifically, the systematic review aims to understand BOD’s 
characteristics at multiple levels (director, BOD, company, and organization), understanding the outcomes of BOD’s

Abstract 
In today's era, the world has been moving substantially towards adopting cleaner fuel for energy demands. 
Transportation is a specific domain that needs to be addressed as soon as possible because of limited fossil fuel 
availability. Electric vehicles have come up with a potential solution for reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions 
(GG). E-mobility has increased in the last decade in developed nations. However, developing countries are still 
in the initial phase of moving towards E-mobility. India, for instance, has been making rigorous efforts to adopt 
Electric vehicles, particularly in the 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler segments. However, due to some constraints, the 
passenger 4-wheeler segment is still lagging in adoption. Mining critical elements like lithium and cobalt are 
subjected to various constraints, so to secure the complex supply chain of Electric vehicle batteries (EVBs), a 
Battery-Swapping Ecosystem (BSE) could be a potential solution to address this issue and improve circularity in 
the battery business. Therefore, this study aims to identify critical barriers in developing a battery-swapping 
ecosystem that could contribute towards the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets of net neutrality 
by 2070. The study identifies potential obstacles through a literature review and consultation with experts. This 
study can help researchers, policymakers and managers make critical decisions for developing a sustainable 
battery-swapping ecosystem.

Abstract 
The 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement stands as a transformative milestone in climate change negotiations. This 
historic summit united developed and developing countries in a binding commitment to combat the effects of climate 
change. Notably, even the largest greenhouse gas emitters, China and the U.S., displayed an unprecedented 
cooperative stance in addressing this global challenge. This study examines the agreement's sustainability, considering 
the collaborative efforts of both nations. 
The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution provides a strategic framework tailored for complex scenarios involving 
multiple stakeholders and intricate decision-making dynamics. It forecasts potential compromise outcomes in real-
world disputes, offering strategic insights. In this research, the GMCR framework analyzes the conflict among major 
Greenhouse Gas emitters during the December 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. 
During the 2015 Paris climate negotiations, key emitters were identified based on their emissions. The United States 
contributed about 14.02% of total GHG emissions, while China accounted for roughly 29.18%. Developed countries, 
excluding the U.S., were responsible for approximately 19.52% of GHG emissions, and emerging countries, excluding 
China, contributed around 9.47%. Developing nations collectively accounted for about 0.02% of GHG emissions, 
constituting approximately 72.19% of global emissions.  
The U.S. committed to reducing emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels within a decade. However, challenges 
arose due to legal and political complexities, hindering their target achievement. China aimed to reduce carbon 
intensity by 60% to 65% from 2005 levels by 2030, increase non-fossil fuel energy consumption to nearly 20%, and 
enhance forest stock volume by about 4.5 billion cubic meters. China allocated $3.1 billion to support developing 
nations in addressing climate change. The European Union and Developed countries aimed for a minimum 40% 
reduction in domestic emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. Unique strategies were adopted; France focused on 
nuclear energy, and Germany prioritized renewables despite challenges like high energy prices. Emerging nations 
invested in renewables, energy efficiency, carbon pricing, and climate adaptation. The agreement acknowledged the 
differentiation between developed and emerging economies, granting flexibility to developing nations in emissions 
reduction goals. Developing countries submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlining emission 
reduction commitments. They pursued policies, programs, and engaged in international mechanisms such as the Green 
Climate Fund for NDC implementation and climate adaptation. 
The 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement's dispute exemplified a pivotal moment in international environmental 
diplomacy. This intricate conflict encompassed diverse interests and responsibilities among nations, particularly China 
and the U.S., the largest emitters. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) will delve into decision makers' 
strategies during the negotiation, aiming to reach a resolution. Additionally, the Prisoner's Dilemma, a classic game 
theory model, will shed light on how rational decision makers, despite potential benefits from cooperation, often make 
suboptimal choices due to uncertainty and differing interests. This model will depict the behavior of decision makers 
during the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement.

Conclusion  
Our results illustrate that while deploying 3DP(s) allow for different supply chain configurations, it is not a binary 
choice between one configuration and the other, rather, it depends on the number of facilities where the 3DP(s) are 
deployed and thus identifying the point where the decision tips from one configuration to the other. Additionally, in 
our case, the number of printers deployed have a negligible effect on the configuration.  
Furthermore, since this case study has been conducted in Germany, which is known to have a high minimum wage, 
and based on our assumption that each printer requires an operating personal, this has led to a labour cost having a 
significant impact on the 3DP positioning within the supply chain model. Alternatively, if a similar case was to be 
conducted in a country with lower labour and transportation costs, this might possibly have an impact on the decision.  
To demonstrate a deeper understanding of the research challenge, we recommend the replicability of our model, 
through different scenario analysis, where variables such as labour costs, 3D printing costs and transportation costs 
could be modified within plausible ranges for further analysis. We also recommend the study of carbon footprint of 
both models as an environmental factor in the sustainability performance.

Abstract 
To determine if an agriculture venture is viable, it is necessary to conduct a thorough business analysis. The purpose 
of these studies is to determine the utilization urban farming crops of waste to generate energy (bioenergy). 
Agricultural wastes are the focus of the current research into the production of bioenergy of the biomass variety. The 
goals of this study are to (1) understand the procedure involved in using waste from farming for bioenergy; 
(2) identify indicators of the feasibility of using agricultural waste for bioenergy; and (3) develop methods for
controlling both internal and external factors that affect this process. Mixed-Methods Research (MMR), Return on
Investment (ROI), Breakeven Point (BEP), Descriptive Statistics, and the Strengths and Weaknesses (SWOT)
analysis were all employed to analyze the study's data. An evaluation of the potential for agribusinesses to profit
from recycling food scraps into biofuel; a case study of RW 06 Betawi Cultural Village Obtaining values of 0.85 for
R/C and 0.85 for B/C, -14% for ROI, and 0.116 for Production BEP at a price of Rp. 8.164 per piece of BEP
demonstrates the complexity of the internal and external factors that influence the utilization of agricultural waste in
RW 06 Betawi Cultural Village. Therefore, it can be determined that farming agricultural waste in RW 06 Betawi
Cultural Village is not economically viable, according to an analysis of the possibility of its utilization in agribusiness.

Introduction 
In recent years, there has been a growing worldwide concern regarding energy and environmental challenges. Based 
on data gathered from the US Energy Information Administration, it is evident that a significant proportion, 
specifically 33%, of worldwide energy consumption continues to rely on oil. Additionally, natural gas accounts for 
22% of global energy consumption, while coal constitutes 27%. The remaining 13% is attributed to other forms of 
energy. The presented data illustrates that fossil energy sources constitute 82% of the total energy requirements of 
humanity. Agricultural waste, once regarded as an inescapable environmental concern, is now recognized as a 
valuable resource that may be harnessed for the generation of bioenergy. 
The utilization of agricultural waste for the production of bioenergy holds promise in mitigating our reliance on fossil 
fuels and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural waste refers to the byproducts generated in the agricultural 
sector, including materials such as peat, coconut husks, bovine manure, and other types of crop residues like maize 
stalks, pea vines, peanut shells, and soybean residues. Agricultural waste encompasses both residual byproducts of 
processed agricultural goods and unused waste materials. In the year 2008, an anonymous source (Anonymous 
2008a).Due to the phenomenon of population expansion and the prevailing national economic conditions, there is 
a discernible escalation in energy demands across all sectors. Various sources of energy, such as solar energy, 
hydrocarbon fuels, biomass, wind, plants, water, and others, can be used to fulfil these energy requirements. The 
energy production in Indonesia is predominantly reliant on non-renewable sources, primarily derived from oil-based 
fuels. In the  event of a global increase in oil prices, it is plausible that such a development may serve as a foundation 
for the substantial subsidies that governments may be compelled to provide. (Riseanggara  2008, translated by 
Syahputra 2013). 
Utilizing alternate energy sources, including NRE, as a viable approach to addressing this issue. The anticipated rise 
in oil reliance is projected to occur as a consequence of the transition away from oil-based fuels towards renewable 
energy sources. The significant potential of renewable energy sources in Indonesia is the underlying reason for this 
assertion. The term ""bioenergy"" is a compound word that combines the morphemes ""bio"" and ""energy"". Bioenergy 
refers to the utilization of renewable energy derived from biological sources that offer advantages to human well-
being. Biomass serves as a significant bioenergy resource. Indonesia is a sovereign archipelagic nation 
characterized by its fertile terrain and rich biodiversity. The use of natural organic materials presents an opportunity 
to convert and employ alternative energy sources that exhibit a higher degree of environmental friendliness 
compared to fossil energy.

The strategy of the Weakness-Threat strategy derives the training programme encompasses instruction in business 
risk management, facilitated by business consultants, as well as modules on financial management, marketing 
management, and human resource management. Additionally, the programme includes guidance from a dedicated 
business consultant. The purpose of this strategy is to enhance the capabilities of individuals in order to facilitate 
the effective management of agricultural waste in a professional manner. 
 
Conclusion 
Based on the findings and prior deliberations, the subsequent deductions have been drawn: The community of RW 06 
Betawi Culture Village is formed as a result of the marketing process involving the utilization of agricultural waste. 
The marketing activities are conducted in collaboration with each regional team (RT) in order to disseminate 
information regarding the locations where people or peasant groups require fertiliser derived from agricultural waste. 
The steps of the process involve the coordination between the RT chiefs to provide information. The RT chairman is 
responsible for disseminating information regarding the recipients of the fertiliser, which may include citizens or 
peasant groups. 
 
Subsequently, the fertilizers can be obtained from the RW office. The recovery process of agricultural waste is 
characterized by a methodical approach and minimal raw material requirements. The process involved in this study 
entailed the collection of yellowed leaves, which were subsequently treated with EM4 and melase. The process has 
several stages. Initially, yellow and dry leaves are gathered and placed into a container. Subsequently, the leaves 
are subjected to destruction. Adequate water, together with EM4 liquid and molasses, are introduced into the 
container. The container is then tightly sealed. On a daily basis, the contents of the container are monitored and 
sprayed with EM4 liquids and molasses for a duration of around one month. 
 
The financial implications of utilising agricultural waste in RW 06 Village of Vegetable Culture. Based on the 
findings, the author can draw the conclusion that the utilisation of agricultural waste is advantageous and justifiable. 
This is supported by the fact that the R/C ratio is 1.14, while the B/C ratio is 0.14. Additionally, the return on 
investment (ROI) is calculated to be 14%. Furthermore, the break-even point (BEP) for production is determined 
to be 87 fruits, with a break-even price (BEP price) of Rs. 6.114 per fruit. 
 
There are various factors, both internal and external, that influence the utilisation of agricultural waste in RW Village 
of Buddhism in 2006. However, these factors lack adequate support from the relevant disciplines, as they are not 
sufficiently comprehensive. Additionally, the local population lacks the capacity to sustain the environment, and 
the nature of environmental development is insufficient. External considerations encompass the presence of a 
substantial need for fertiliser, which is readily recognized by parties exhibiting irresponsibility.Future Research 
The utilization of agricultural waste within the RW 06 Rural Rural Behavioral Culture should be sustained in order 
to enhance performance and promote the overall well-being of the community. In light of this, the following 
recommendations are proposed: There is a need to raise awareness among the residents of RW06 Betawi Cultural 
Village regarding the need of environmental sustainability. This can be achieved by fostering a familiarity with 
agricultural practices, so enabling all people to appreciate the significance of utilizing agricultural waste. 
There is a necessity to enhance the marketing network in order to ensure the dissemination of marketing efforts 
throughout the entirety of the South Jakarta region. There is a necessity to engage in training program that focus on 
risk management, financial management, marketing management, and human resource management. In order to 
facilitate the cultivation of citizens' skills and provide professional assistance in the management of agricultural 
waste, it is imperative to establish appropriate measures.

Abstract 
The issue of trash management poses a significant challenge in the region, particularly in urban areas where the 
quantity of garbage continues to rise. However, the existing waste management strategies are unable to effectively 
address this escalating trend. Within the realm of household waste, household rubbish encompasses both organic 
and inorganic waste. The former category includes remnants of vegetables and food, while the latter encompasses 
items such as food packaging, plastic bags, paper, and bottles. Additionally, household waste extends to 
encompass water resulting from various washing operations, among other similar sources. The household waste 
discussed in this study originates from routine activities inside residential settings, with the exception of certain 
organic waste and refuse materials. 
The sanitary authorities collected the household rubbish from their separate regions. Once gathered, the home 
waste is transported to a temporary disposal location, commonly referred to as a Temporary Processing location 
(TPS). Following its transportation from the temporary storage facility (TPS), the garbage is further conveyed to 
the ultimate disposal location known as the final disposal point (TPA). The ultimate destination for waste 
management is the final discharge location, where waste is disposed of and then reused through recycling and 
other waste management procedures. One approach involves the conversion of waste materials into methane gas. 
Problem Statement. The process of transforming domestic waste into methane gas Methane gas is an invisible, 
scentless, and extremely combustible gas composed of a single carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Methane 
gas possesses properties that are 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its capacity to trap heat 
within the Earth's atmosphere. If left unmanaged and underutilised, methane gases have the potential to exacerbate 
the existing levels of greenhouse gases present in the Earth's atmosphere. Methane constitutes a significant 
component of biogas. Biogas is comprised of various gases, primarily methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), 
with trace amounts of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and ammonia. Ammonia (NH3) is a compound composed of one 
nitrogen atom bonded to three 
In addition to hydrogen (H2), the presence of sulphur nitrogen, water content, and carbon dioxide (CO2) has been 
reported. Both organic and inorganic waste materials have the potential to be transformed into methane gas, 
commonly referred to as biogas. Methane gas (CH4) is a gaseous compound that is produced by anaerobic 
bacteria, particularly the methanogenic bacterium. Significant quantities of methane gas were detected in the 
remnants of vegetation, straw, animal waste, grasslands, sedimentary formations, and even straw. 
Method. Methane gas is spontaneously generated at the final disposal site through the process of bacterial 
evaporation, even in the absence of deliberate processing or the inclusion of specific compounds. The burning of 
methane gas produces thermal energy, making it a viable option for alternative fuel sources or power generation

Abstract 
Introduction. At first, just the pines of the pineapple plant were harvested because they were the part of the plant 
that was regarded to have economic value. Pineapples can be grown and harvested, providing a source of revenue 
for farmers; in addition, both the pineapple fruit and its juice are essential to human nutrition. In addition to the 
volume of pineapples harvested, the amount of garbage that is produced is also a significant burden. Farmers 
would traditionally dispose of discarded pineapple leaves by burning them, but thanks to advances in science and 
technology, those leaves can now be used for something else. The fibres in the pineapple leaves are of a very high 
grade, and they can be extracted from the various leaf portions. Since ancient times, the fibres extracted from 
pineapple leaves have been included into the production of a wide variety of textile goods. When used as a material 
for fabric, ananas leaf fibre has the properties of being able to easily absorb moisture, being robust enough and 
not easily scratched, not being hot, and being able to absorb sweat; these traits are desirable. While the pineapple 
is being cooked, the leaves can be successfully peeled with minimal effort. 
In Indonesia, pineapple leaf fibre is commonly used as a textile thread, and this practise is carried out at the 
community level in the context of textile manufacture. Many people still rely on manual processes despite the fact 
that the process of extracting pineapple leaf fibres requires sophisticated equipment. The older pineapple leaves 
are removed, and while they are still moist, they are put through a machine that crushes them into fibres. After 
this step, the fibres are washed, combed, and left to dry. After going through this process, the fibres that have been 
spun into threads are then separated from one another and linked so that they can be woven into fabric (Mampuk, 
2020). There are two steps involved in the process of extracting the fibres from the pineapple leaf, and these are 
the raw fibres and the fine fibres. During the first stage of the process, known as extraction, the leaf is broken 
down mechanically using extractor tools in order to produce rough fibres. The extracted raw fibres are then 
subjected to further processing in order to be transformed into the fine fibre that is found in the pineapple leaf. It 
is first necessary to use a degumming instrument in order to extract the fine fibre from the pineapple leaf; this 
fibre is then chopped using a cutting tool.

Abstract 
Energy is defined as the capacity to perform work, which can take the form of heat, light, mechanics, chemistry, 
or electromagnetics, according to the first paragraph of Article 1 of the New & Renewable Energy (NRE) Act 
mentioned that all forms of energy that are obtained from or created by new technologies of processing non- 
renewable sources of energy and renewable energy sources are collectively referred to as ""new energy."" Examples 
of new energy sources include nuclear, hydrogen, methane gas, coal, molten coal, and carbonated coal. Power 
that comes from renewable sources is referred to as renewable power. The concept of ""new technology"" is 
ingrained within the meaning of ""new energy."" To put it another way, new energy is a form of energy that has 
never been utilised before, and it is an energy that is generated by technological means. Renewable energy sources 
are sources of energy that are produced from sustainable energy resources if they are correctly managed. Examples 
of renewable energy sources include earth heat, wind, bioenergy, sunshine, flow, and watershed, in addition to 
the movement and temperature differential of the sea layer. (Law). A source of energy known as renewable new 
energy (NRE) or renewable energy is one that derives its power from natural resources and is able to generate 
more energy than is used up in the process of extraction. This mature age, the growth of technology, and the 
change in the way that humans make use of energy has resulted in a more wide range of possibilities. This is 
because people have become more aware of the negative effects on the environment that are caused by the usage 
of non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels. PT First Hulu Energy has and is in the process of conducting 
community development programs with the goal of increasing the use of these new renewable energies in the area 
in which they work. Currently participating in one of these schemes called WASTECO, which stands for Waste 
to Energy for Community through a complex network of obstructions. After that, the community uses this methane 
gas as an alternative to LPG gas for cooking, and UMKM uses it as a source of energy for their production 
business. Additionally, the gas is used by the community as a replacement for liquified petroleum gas. One of the 
economic indicators that was impacted as a result of the execution of the WASTECO program was a reduction of 
Rupiahs 272.6 million per year in home cooking costs. 
NRE Program that is being implemented by PT Pertamina is not just restricted to the utilisation of methane gas, 
but it also encompasses the utilisation of other forms of renewable energy, such as solar energy (PLTS), biogas, 
biodiesel, and wind power (PLTB). The Self-Powered Energy Villages plan makes it possible to gain access to 
various renewable energy sources at prices that are more reasonable and on a communal level. Self-powered 
energy villages is a programme that adjusts to each community empowering location in such a way that allows

Abstract 
Introduction. Along with local governments and communities, oil and gas companies, including Pertamina Hulu 
Energi and numerous other global energy companies, have pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Scope 
3 is included in the net-zero goal for corporations, and there is an immediate need to assess and reduce GHG 
emissions throughout the life cycle. To reach this goal, Pertamina EP Subang Field and Pertamina EP Prabumulih 
Field have partnered with local governments and communities to implement development programs in the 
agricultural sectors surrounding the PHE work areas. In the framework of Socioentrepreneurship this study aims 
to evaluate the effectiveness of the pineapple zero waste management in both regions (Subang and Prabumulih) 
through qualitative analysis of program implementation and community impact. documentation and interviews.  
Problem Statement. Whether it's called community development, community empowerment, or community 
development, this line of work involves knowledge from a wide variety of fields. Community development is an 
aspect of civic life that fosters social cohesiveness and improves residents' quality of life. Community 
Development can touch on a wide range of actual problems that are faced by a community in a certain region. 
These problems can stem from a variety of different sources. These problems include things like poverty and 
inequality, as well as decision-making processes that have an impact on people's lives, as well as problems with 
health, education, and the environment, as well as other problems that are unique to the community. 
Method. The utilisation of pineapple leaf fibres as fabric fibres aligns with the principles of green textile 
production. The utilisation of green textile presents a viable and ecologically conscious substitute for synthetic 
textile resources. The utilisation of pineapple leaf fibre as a natural material presents a negligible residual impact 
on the surrounding ecosystem. The production method of pineapple fibres incorporates an innovative approach in 
the utilisation of the decorticator machine. The production capacity, which was previously limited to 3 kg, has 
been enhanced to accommodate 5 kg. Additionally, the inclusion of a waste storage container in the machine has 
resulted in a cleaner production site. The filling operation is additionally conducted with manual weaving 
implements. Furthermore, apart from its application in the textile sector, pineapple leaf fibres have the potential 
to be utilised in the production of vertical blind fabrics, wallpaper, paper raw materials, and can be further 
developed as composite materials such as reinforced plastics or roofing materials. Eternit is a brand name 
commonly associated with a type of construction material known as fibre.  
Result. Regarding the possible advantages of alternative pineapple leaf fibres, such as their utility as materials for 
the production of ropes, brushes, and diverse crafts including wallets, pans, and bags.The local community in the 
village of Cikadu has effectively utilised the ample supply of raw materials, such as pineapple leaves, through the 
implementation of a Sociopreneurship model. The CSR programme implemented by PT PHE has the potential to 
serve as a platform for sociopreneurial activities aimed at addressing social issues in the village of Cikadu and 
enhancing the social value within the local community. PHE has had a lot of engagement with the community 
that lives around WK as a result of the spread of WK that PHE was responsible for. PHE administers a programme 
called Community Development with the goal of improving the quality of life in communities all over the world. 
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plan that is being implemented by PT PHE has progressed to the point

Introduction  
The information, communication, and technology (ICT) sector has the potential to drive inclusive growth in Africa, 
but limited investment in this sector has restricted its ability to do so. Digital divide refers to the gap between those 
who have access to digital technologies and those who do no. The digital divide represents the disparity between 
people or groups who can utilize digital technologies like computers and the internet, and those who lack access or 
experience difficulties in using them. According to  (Vanessa et al. 2019), bridging the digital gap aims to encourage 
fair and balanced access to digital technology and the internet, especially for people who are disadvantaged or 
neglected. This divide can emerge in numerous forms, including inequality in internet access, computer ownership, 
and digital literacy. 
  
Modern telecommunications infrastructure is important for economic development and competitiveness. To fill this 
gap in literature (David 2019) states that infrastructure development is extremely vital for emerging economies like 
Zimbabwe, since it not only promotes local economic growth, but also defines their capacity to engage in global 
markets and attract both domestic and international investments for sustainable development. This article will explore","Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

A lot of countries in Africa like Zimbabwe have not grasped the notion of ICT being a vital tool for efficient delivery 
of service and obtaining a competitive edge and the fact that the last decade has seen the country plunge into chronic 
poverty, economic instability and alarming levels of corruption has not helped (Diga et al. 2013). 
 
A comparative study by  (Moodley  2005)  states that the South African government considers ICT as a significant 
tool for development, poverty reduction, and technological advancement. However, this view is often rigid and 
overoptimistic, promoting a deterministic model that views technology as an external force that can only be embraced 
or adapted, and this restricted ICT model for development has become prevalent and excludes various ideas. To 
conduct a more impartial study of ICT for development, we need to move beyond technological determinism and 
investigate different viewpoints on society and technology (Vanessa et al. 2019). 
 
To fill this gap another recent study in the medical filed eludes that ICT can improve access to essential services such 
as healthcare, education, and finance, especially in remote areas (Shao et al. 2022). There was a growing consensus 
between economic expansion scholars and development professionals regarding how ICT integration can play a 
critical role in stimulating economic growth and sustainable development in the USA (Lau & Tokutsu 1992). A key 
problem with this argument was conducted by  (Datta, 2004) to examine the relationship between economic growth 
and ICT infrastructure over an extended period. The study utilized data from twenty-two countries and proves that 
there exists a considerable and favourable correlation between the two variables. Recent studies proves that most 
developing countries in Africa have showed a significant improvement in ICT adoption and usage however, despite 
these promising ICT benefits, some of the countries still have extremely low ICT Development Index scores. 
 
Based on the above, existing literature has confirmed the important influence of ICT on the economy for sustainable 
development. The conclusion is that there is positive correlation between ICT adoption and economic 
growth.However, there are still some deficiencies in the topic to mention there is still no clear conclusion regarding 
the relationship between ICT and economic development 
 
Methods  
Systems thinking approach useful strategy for ICT adoption in Zimbabwe. Systems thinking is a way of looking at the 
world that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things (Jokonya, 2016). It is a useful tool for strategizing and 
addressing complex problems such as the challenges of ICT integration in Zimbabwe. Applying the systems approach, 
several strategies can be implemented to effectively use ICT in Zimbabwe for sustainable development. 
 
ICT Infrastructure Development: 
Investing in ICT infrastructure, countries can improve their ability to connect to the global economy and increase their 
competitiveness in the digital age (Kayisire & Wei, 2016). One of the key problems in Zimbabwe's ICT sector is the 
lack of adequate and sufficient infrastructure. To effectively integrate ICT, the government must focus on establishing 
an efficient and cost-effective   infrastructure to facilitate connectivity across the country. This involves investing in 
high-speed networks (Starlink), fiber-optic networks, mobile broadband, and other forms of infrastructure that allow 
data transfer. 
 
Developing Appropriate Policies and Regulations by Government: 
A bad or unsustainable environment or business ecosystem affects the efficiency and adoption of ICT in any country. 
Recent research by (Lee et al.  2016) proves that government policies affect ICT development. The research was done 
to analyse different government policies in USA, Japan, China, and South Korea. The government of Zimbabwe must 
establish policies and regulations that foster innovation and promote growth in ICT, while also creating a legal 
framework that safeguards intellectual property. The ICT working environment must be sustainable, and this must be 
supported in the policies. 
 
Encouraging public-private partnerships:  
A theoretical issue that has dominated the ICT field for many years is that partnerships between the public and private 
sectors can be effective in driving ICT adoption in many countries. It has been conclusively shown that in countries 
such as India, the United Kingdom, China, and the USA, public-private partnerships are seen as a strategy for 
promoting ICT development (Kuriyan & Ray, 2009).These partnerships can help to provide funding for ICT projects, 
as well as support the development of policies and regulations that promote ICT growth and innovation hence","Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Lisbon, Portugal, July 18-20, 2023 
© IEOM Society International 
sustainable development. This usually involves collaboration between public and private sector organizations to 
jointly fund and implement ICT projects. 
 
Investing in education and training: 
UNESCO mentioned that investing in ICT training and education accelerated the process of ICT adoption (Leye  
2007). Many controversies related to sustainability and development state that researching and publishing ICT work 
promotes a wider understanding of the topic (Ponelis & Holmner, 2015). Despite these controversies, there is growing 
consensus that research and publishing ICT work can play a crucial role in promoting sustainability and development. 
This means that by publishing their findings, scholars or researchers can share their insights with the 
government, policymakers, practitioners, and the wider public, helping to inform decision-making and promote ICT 
adoption. In a nutshell, this also includes the development of educational curricula that incorporate ICT skills, as well 
as training programs for individuals and organizations to improve their ICT knowledge and capabilities. 
 
Hence the collaborations among private sectors, academia, and government are encouraged to develop a long-term 
partnership and strategy, which also include the joint investment to promote the usage of ICT. 
 
Promoting Digital Entrepreneurship and Supporting local entrepreneurship 
Digital entrepreneurship must be supported and moving central to the discipline of ICT and business management is 
the promotion of a technological environment that is favourable to local digital entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe (Ngoasong, 
2018). This includes digitizing business operations, using ICT tools to communicate and collaborate, and leveraging 
ICT to enhance customer experience and expand market reach. Therefore, it involves providing support for local 
entrepreneurs who are developing innovative ICT solutions that can address local challenges. ICT presents 
opportunities for entrepreneurship and job creation in Zimbabwe. The government must encourage digital 
entrepreneurship by providing incentives such as tax breaks, access to funding, and incubation centres. This can help 
to create a supportive environment for ICT businesses to thrive. 
 
Conclusion  
In conclusion, bridging the digital divide in Zimbabwe by using ICT is essential for fostering economic development 
in the country. The integration and use of ICT in various sectors of the economy can lead to increased efficiency, 
productivity, and innovation, all of which are critical drivers of economic growth. In addition, by promoting digital 
entrepreneurship and providing digital skills training, Zimbabwe can tap into the potential of the digital economy and 
create new opportunities for employment and income generation. However, realizing the full potential of ICT requires 
concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including the government, the private sector, civil society, and development 
partners. By working together, Zimbabwe can harness the power of ICT to transform its economy and improve 
citizens’ lives.

Abstract 
This study aims to calculate the value-added of processed cassava products and make efforts to increase value added 
product benefits as recommendations for improvement. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Hayami 
method are integrated to find the best solution as several alternative strategies proposed to increase value added 
product. Data was collected through purposive sampling method which it interviewed four respondents to obtain data 
about Hayami's method and distributed questionnaires to five experts to fulfill the AHP analysis. This study was 
conducted in one of the business units that has the potential to drive the people's economy in West Sumatra Indonesia 
is processed cassava products. The cassava business unit in this case study has five types of 5 main products. The 
problem in this study is the existence of constraints on marketing and production, the uncertainty of raw material 
prices. There are still many expired products, and this business still uses simple equipment technology for product 
processing. This affects the level of value added and profit maximization received. This study found that the strategy 
in alternative one is the best alternative because it has the most significant evaluation weight value compared to the 
other alternatives. This strategy emphasizes that business units buy raw materials directly from farmers. The further 
study is suggested to adopt multiple case studies by selecting the same business unit clustering to obtain the main 
criteria for increasing value-added product of cassava processing business units.

1. Introduction
Small-medium enterprises (SMEs) have many limitations in developing their business units. The selection of raw 
materials with the lowest prices is one of the considerations for SMEs in carrying out their production processes (Serin 
et al., 2016). Then, the food products' main problem is that they are not durable or have a fast expiration date. Thus, 
the risk of loss for food products is higher than for other products (Serin et al., 2016). This limitation is the lack of 
mapping problems by business units. Not only raw materials and expired products are the main obstacles for SMEs, 
limited facilities or production technology make it difficult for business units to compete in the market. A study stated 
that SMEs' competition was influenced by technology adoption and implementation in the production system (Irjayanti 
and Azis, 2012). Therefore, the technology could speed up the production process and maintain product quality 
accepted by consumers. Indeed, the high challenges for SMEs become multi-criteria decision making in formulating 
business process improvement. A research review was conducted to determine the SME's development strategy (Hörte 
et al., 2008). There are many approaches adopted to assist business actors in increasing profits. However, several 
studies suggest that it is necessary to calculate the additional value at an early stage before improvising business 
processes (Lestari et al., 2022; Sujová and Marcineková, 2015). Thus, the determination of the added value becomes 
the basis for planning improvements and improvising strategies to increase profits. However, several studies also

The implementation of the criteria used to assess the success of this research can be described as follows: 
1. The calculation of the added value of the product using the Hayami Method on the business unit for 
processed cassava products has succeeded in describing the changes in added value from the current 
condition. It is reflected in the constraints of unstable raw material prices, sales of products that are still left 
over, the existence of expired products, and the processing of products that are in short supply using simple 
equipment become a better situation because of the applicability of the method. However, of the three types 
of cassava processed products studied, not all products experienced significant added value and profits 
changes. This is due to several factors, one of which is raw materials from different types of products, so 
the prices are also different. 
2. Meanwhile, profits received by the company experienced a drastic increase, averaging 80%. This increase in 
added value and profit is obtained based on applying the attributes in the alternative one as a recommendation 
to increase the added value and profits received.  
3. The results of research using the Hayami Method on business unit processed cassava products that have been 
carried out reveal that the results are the same as the results of research conducted (Sari and Putri, 2020). 
This succeeded in calculating the added value of cassava into processed products so that the state of added 
value and profit of a business unit was obtained. 
 
A study of a business unit producing processed cassava products successfully determined the added value of the 
current product for Products A, B, and C. It is possible to determine how to increase the profits received by business 
units from the processed cassava product by understanding the added value. As a result, the business unit can gain 
more value and profits from each cassava processed product than previously. A business unit can increase its added 
value and profits by implementing alternative ones as a recommendation. The first alternative in this case study 
suggests that the business unit obtains cheaper raw materials than before by buying directly from farmers. This can 
optimize the use of production raw materials that are usually excess and reduce the number of direct labor because 
there are fewer. Workers can carry out work, increase selling prices as recommended, and reduce the use of product 
delivery operational costs by warning workers not to use company vehicles for personal purposes. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study focuses on a business unit of cassava processed products. As a result, it would be preferable if additional 
research was conducted to compare the added value of a business unit product to that of other business unit products. 
It aims to generalize the development of cassava processing businesses in an area using this comparison. Aside from 
the ability to increase the added value and profits of the product, future research is also recommended to compare the 
added value product of a business unit with other SMEs to make a business unit more advanced and developed in the 
future.

Abstract 
Big data analysis and cloud computing are becoming increasingly involved in the area of financial technology 
(FinTech). Derivatives such as futures and options are complex financial instruments. The risk in trading derivatives 
is huge. This study aims to develop a future trading support system for investors to control and hedge their risk. Real 
stock market information from FinTech is huge and complicated. High-dimensional big data tend to obscure the 
essential feature of data. Identifying intrinsic characteristics of high-dimensional data is important for various fields 
of research, not limited to financial trading. Reviewing previous studies, there are no suitable methods to deal with 
high-dimensional future data. Traditional methods from statistics and machine learning are usually shallow models 
(compared with deep learning models). They cannot fully represent deep, compositional, and hierarchical data 
features. This study tries to address the problem by constructing classifiers in hyperbolic space, in which one can 
effectively capture latent hierarchical relationships (or deep features). Recently, embedding data into hyperbolic 
space—a class of non-Euclidean spaces with constant negative curvature—has received increasing attention due to its 
effectiveness in capturing latent hierarchical structure (or deep features) of data. The performance of the new model 
is examined using datasets of Taiwan future markets, and compared with traditional techniques from statistics and 
machine learning. Empirical results demonstrated that the new model outperforms traditional methods significantly.

Abstract 
Healthcare organizations are recognized as knowledge-driven entities that prioritize the quality of patient care and 
adapt to dynamic environments. The adoption of learning organization practices can support healthcare professionals 
in enhancing their skills and knowledge, as well as discovering more effective approaches to their work. Furthermore, 
fostering innovativeness enables organizations to remain effective and successful amidst unpredictable and diverse 
circumstances. This study aims to assess the extent to which the dimensions of a learning organization are associated 
with innovativeness. The study involved 336 medical personnel working at My Duc Hospital, and there were two 
scales used in the study: the Dimensions of the Learning Organization Questionnaire (DLOQ) developed by Watkins 
and Marsick (1997) and the Perceived Organizational Innovativeness (PORGI) scale proposed by Hurt and Teigen 
(1977). The study revealed a substantial influence of all learning organization dimensions on innovativeness. Results 
further indicate that the dimensions of the learning organizations explained 39.8% of the variance for innovation. The 
findings from the regression analysis further demonstrated that the elements of Systems connections and Strategic 
leadership accounted for the variations observed in innovativeness.

1. Introduction
Organizations should adapt to the fast environmental changes in today's world to survive in the competitive market. 
One way to self-improve companies' capabilities is to focus on learning as a critical element in reducing the significant 
shocks of change through quickly reconfiguring and reallocating resources based on uncertainty (Slater and Narver 
1995). A learning organization is defined as skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge and modifying 
its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights (Garvin 1993).  
Innovativeness is a meaningful way many companies use to adjust to changes. Most definitions share that innovation 
implies adopting a new idea or behavior. Companies can stay effective and successful in unstable and varied 
environments by improving innovativeness. A learning culture encourages organizations to question the information 
they process and whether their approach to innovation is applicable (Baker and Sinkula 1999). Therefore, building a 
learning organization means becoming an innovative firm.  
Like other industries, healthcare organizations also face challenges from environmental fluctuations. Implementing 
learning organization practices can assist medical personnel in enhancing their competencies and expertise and 
exploring more effective approaches to their work. Moreover, by focusing on innovation, healthcare organizations can

Abstract 
Sustainable Supply Chain Management concerns with simultaneously improving social, economic and environmental 
performance through supply chain management practices. Sustainable practices in supply chains include reducing 
waste and emissions, using renewable energy, sourcing materials from sustainable sources, and promoting fair labor 
practices. Once practiced, this will lead to sustainable supply chains. Rembang Regency is the area with the largest 
capture fisheries production and production value in Central Java, Indonesia. Currently  Rembang Regency capture 
fisheries face various challenges on the economic performance of its fishermen, environment issue at its both fish 
auction site and fishing water as well as its fishermen social performance, therefore it is important to improve its 
capture fisheries supply chain management to achieve their supply chain sustainability. In depth interview was carried 
out with some fishermen and stakeholders in order to identify the root cause of their sustainable supply chain. The 
analysis result indicates that capture fisheries stakeholders have to make some changes in order to achieve the triple 
bottom line of their sustainable supply chain. Economic Performance should be improved from the auction payment 
lead time procedures. Whilst the environment performance should be improved through the improvements to the 
handling of the catch before it is brought to the auction site. Furthermore, waste management at capture waters 
locations needs to be a concern of the local fisheries service policy.  Social performance improvement should be done 
by improving its local auction procedure policies. Active participation from the stakeholders is one of the major 
improvement success factor.

Abstract 
The global industries have undergone a transformative evolution in response to technological changes, fostering 
greater flexibility, reactivity, and productivity. However, contemporary industry conditions present novel challenges, 
including rapid technological shifts, heightened complexity, shifting consumer preferences, and evolving legal 
mandates. This paper explores the impact of these factors in the context of the Food & Beverage (F&B) sector, 
particularly among Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Recent technological advancements have 
catalyzed the digitization of various sectors, including F&B, giving rise to an online retail marketplace. This shift has 
significantly altered consumer behavior, fostering the emergence of online food purchases. Digitalization has 
empowered F&B establishments, especially Enterprises, to streamline their operations, leading to enhanced service 
quality and expeditious deliveries, thereby elevating customer satisfaction. The ongoing process of globalization and 
digitization has ushered in opportunities to engage in online food sales, with delivery and offline pickup options. 
Within this digital transformation, the concept of cloud kitchens has gained prominence. Cloud kitchens, also known 
as ghost kitchens, represent a virtual culinary venture designed for takeaway and delivery services, devoid of 
traditional dine-in facilities. This model substantially reduces operational costs compared to conventional restaurants, 
offering scalability without the financial risks of physical expansion. Businesses operating within this framework can 
continually adapt to market dynamics, maximizing customer satisfaction and revenue. This study employs a systematic 
literature review approach, analyzing various sources to delve into the business development of brands implementing 
the ""Cloud Kitchen"" concept. It aims to identify critical success factors, technology integration, and consumer 
perspectives while acknowledging the evolving post-pandemic dining landscape. The research underscores the 
potential for cloud kitchens to reshape the culinary industry, provided they address the challenge of meeting 
consumers' desire for communal dining in a post-pandemic era. By comprehending the factors influencing consumer 
perspectives, technology adoption, and product innovation within cloud kitchens, this study contributes valuable 
insights to guide businesses operating in this domain.

4. Discussion 
Looking ahead to future research directions, there are several compelling areas for exploration that warrant attention. 
Investigating the evolving dynamics of consumer preferences and behaviors in response to changing market 
landscapes remains a pivotal topic. Exploring solutions that bridge the gap between virtual convenience and the desire 
for social engagement could yield valuable insights for the industry. As the field of cloud kitchens continues to evolve, 
each of these areas presents an exciting opportunity to contribute to the growing body of knowledge and to drive 
innovation in F&B entrepreneurship. 
4.1 Product Development Perspectives 
This research advances the previous studies by comprehending a range of factors influencing consumer perspectives 
and enterprise actors and a comprehensive exploration of technology adoption. As this innovative culinary model 
continues to reshape the food industry, there exists a noteworthy gap in understanding the nuanced factors that drive 
successful product innovation within cloud kitchens. Exploring this area in upcoming research holds the promise of 
unraveling insights that can shape strategies for businesses operating in this space. By investigating how cloud kitchens 
can harness their unique operational dynamics, technology integration, and consumer preferences, researchers can 
illuminate pathways to enhance product offerings, streamline processes, and elevate customer experiences.  
4.2. Post-Pandemic Challenge 
In the pandemic era, cloud kitchens have emerged as a resilient solution to the challenges faced by traditional dining 
establishments. However, a noteworthy aspect that warrants exploration in future research is the post-pandemic 
challenge of meeting the consumer desire for a dining experience that cloud kitchens inherently lack. As restrictions 
ease and people seek a return to social dining experiences, the absence of a physical dining area in cloud kitchens 
becomes more pronounced. Investigating this aspect can shed light on the evolving consumer preferences and the 
ways in which cloud kitchens can adapt to cater to these desires. Researchers could delve into creative approaches 
such as collaborative pop-up spaces, virtual dining experiences, or hybrid models that incorporate limited seating 
arrangements alongside the core delivery-focused operations. By addressing this challenge head-on, the research can 
contribute to shaping the strategies of cloud kitchens in a way that honors the need for communal dining while 
leveraging their core strengths in efficiency, convenience, and diverse culinary offerings. This nuanced exploration 
stands to provide insights that bridge the gap between evolving consumer expectations and the operational realities of 
cloud kitchens in a post-pandemic world. 
 
5. Conclusion

Abstract 
Ekowisata Pesisir Labuhan on Bangkalan's north shore and Mbak Dewi Shuji Tourist Village in Lembak Muaraenim, 
South Sumatra, are PT PHE WMO's and PT PEP Prabumulih Region community development projects. Labuhan was 
initially a mangrove and coral reef protection reserve. The nearby communities dump waste in Shuji Lake. Labuhan 
Tourism Village and Mbak Dewi Shuji Tourist Village now support the local economy. This raises energy demand 
and necessity. Labuhan Village and Lembak Village use solar and wind energy as subsectors.  Labuhan and Mbak 
Dewi Shuji tourist villages created by the four actors collaborated. The Quadruple Helix—government, community, 
corporate or industrial, and academic—collaborates. The study examines how four actors collaborate via Qudruple 
Helix social innovation. The research is qualitative, using interviews and documentation. The research found that 
society, PT PHE WMO, PT Pertamina EP Prabumulih Field, Pokdarwis, and academics collaborate well to establish 
the Tourism Village.

Introduction 
Tourism has emerged as a prominent cultural phenomenon within Indonesian society. Regardless of whether it pertains 
to domestic or international travel, Tourism has emerged as an obligatory pursuit undertaken by individuals within a 
society as a means of alleviating the weariness associated with their daily routines. The presence of a recreational 
travel population contributes to an increased demand for tourist attractions.  
The selection of tourist destinations is influenced by factors such as affordability, convenient locations, distinctive 
attractions, and the availability of excursions. Additionally, the educational activities offered by these destinations 
contribute to their appeal among visitors. The tourism industry in Indonesia is seeing significant growth due to its 
potential to contribute to regional development within the framework of regional autonomy.  
The major aim of this development is to enhance the overall welfare of the local population. In addition, tourism has 
a crucial role in earning foreign currency and creating significant investment prospects. It is unsurprising that when a 
tourist destination is present in a particular region, the local population often makes concerted efforts to cater to the 
requirements of the visiting tourists. 
The tourism resort has emerged as a popular destination among both local people and immigrants residing in the 
vicinity. Tourist villages has a distinctive character that serves to accentuate the inherent potential and local cultural

Second, industry or business. Industry or business actors who play a role in the Mbak Tourism Village of the Devi 
Shuji is the Pertamina PT EP Prabumulih Field. Pertamina became a partner who played a role as a facilitator of the 
community to be able to build the Mbak Dewi Shuji tourism village.  
 
Pertamina also provided infrastructure support as well as improving the infrastructure of the campsite ground. The 
Pertamina also carried out training related to the management of the organization, response to fire disasters, training 
of the template of the shirt, and the training of garbage management.  
 
Third, academics. The role of academics is as the party that supports Mbak Dewi Shuji Tourism Village from the 
implementation of knowledge through training in collaboration with Pertamina EP Prabumulih Field.  
 
Fourth, the community or civic society. The role of community or civil society is as the main actor of the construction 
of the village tourism Mbak Devi Shuji. Local heroes also disseminate knowledge in seminars, workshops, and training 
collaborations from both the government and the private sector. As for the community group formed, the Sadar 
Tourism Group is responsible for the digitization of the Mbak Dewi Shuji Tourist Village and the maintenance of 
facilities. 
 
Conclusion 
The establishment of Labuhan Coast Ecowisata Village and Mbak Dewi Shuji Tourism Village may be attributed to 
the collaborative efforts of the local community, industry and commercial sectors, academic institutions, and the 
government. Subsequently, both of these tourist settlements derive their energy from sustainable and renewable 
sources. The energy sources utilized in Pesisir Labuhan Ecowisata Village comprise a hybrid power system that 
combines solar energy with other sources. Conversely, the energy supply in Mbak Dewi Shuji Tourism Village solely 
relies on solar power. The implementation of the quadruple helix model in these two communities demonstrates a 
collaborative approach that has the potential to positively impact the quality of life for the local population. The 
sustainability of the independence of the Labuhan Coast Ecosystem Village and the Mbak Dewi Shuji Tourist Village 
is anticipated to be upheld through the collective efforts of the four players involved in the collaboration.
